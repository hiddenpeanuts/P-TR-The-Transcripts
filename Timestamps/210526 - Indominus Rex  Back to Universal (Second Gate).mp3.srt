1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,940
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, the entertainment capital of listener supported

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,060
podcast feeds.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm Jason Sheridan here as always with Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,060
I am here, yes.

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,960
This is the entertainment capital, for sure.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,740
That's right.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,820
And Scott Geradner?

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,240
That's right.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,220
Burbank, the podcast capital of us, at least.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,820
That of course, phrase is a reference to Universal Studios Hollywood, the entertainment capital

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,120
of Los Angeles, a marketing term that they got and went with and went, everyone went,

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,960
okay, sure.

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,580
But Universal Hollywood, a place recently reopened that at this point in time, we've

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,280
all been back to, we've all returned to the entertainment capital.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,760
Yes, we've all been back to ride the movies, as I was saying, on the main feed.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,080
It was great.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,420
It's great to be back.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,800
Great to be back doing, great to be back going into Target also.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,520
But I don't want to dwell on that element.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,200
I feel like I'm talking too much about that.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,420
I just want to say, yes, it's good to be back to the place where the bass is pumping, you're

23
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,420
on the starway, the Bart man is roaring in the speakers.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,760
Hit songs from 2000 to 2005 are in the air, which is a more recent sense of pop culture

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,480
than Disney has, but I don't want them to necessarily.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,100
Did Will.

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,140
i.

28
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,920
am do a song with Iggy Azalea that we haven't heard about?

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,500
Yes, I think so, but it's playing at Universal somewhere.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,660
You've never heard it before, but it's there and it's 10 years old.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,740
Universal exclusive, yeah.

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,020
Somehow it was number one for seven weeks, but you can't find anyone who can sing it,

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,640
knows it, knows a lyric.

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,140
It's called Come and Get It.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,040
Will.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,200
i.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,420
am featuring Iggy Azalea.

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,140
Iggy Azalea and DJ Snake and Lauv.

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,580
Yeah, all those people are on it.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,360
They're all on it.

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,040
They're other kids.

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,100
We've never heard it, but all of their children are going to go to college on the residuals

43
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,060
of Universal Studios Hollywood getting exclusive rights to the song.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,500
Yes.

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
You know we got to come and get it.

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,180
Get, get, get, get, get, get it.

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,260
Yeah, that's a sample directly from that song.

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,220
That's directly, yeah.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,360
So.

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,860
Grab a glass and wha-wha-whet it.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,720
Ha!

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,460
As good as Will.

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,960
i.

54
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,960
am's raps are.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,880
And also Plea, I don't know if it's been scrubbed from the internet with the essential death

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,500
of the company, but the Will.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,200
i.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,880
am Donald Trump rap from Funny or Die, one of the Funny or

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,340
Die greats, highly recommended.

60
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,720
Did you guys ever see that one?

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,540
I don't think I did.

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,440
Where he raps like, Donald Trump said, grab you by the wheel, and then it's a cat.

63
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,460
Rawr.

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,480
He stressed his trump.

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,900
And then he's like, you know, he's doing a cocky trump rap and then it's, and then like

66
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,140
record scratch stop and he steps out as himself.

67
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:19,980
All right.

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,920
I think it's obvious.

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,400
I do not look anything like Donald Trump.

70
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,740
But the other thing it's obvious, Donald Trump does not look anything like a president.

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,840
And then then he keeps going like that for two minutes.

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,660
Wow, really?

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,560
It's incredible.

74
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
I've never seen this.

75
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,240
I believe you that that is real, but I would also believe if you were doing a long con

76
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,380
on us and at the end of the episode, you told us like, hey, by the way, that I totally made

77
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,800
that up.

78
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,980
It's not real.

79
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,340
You never know when it comes to Funny or Die, plus helping Democrats win elections, any

80
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,380
things up in the air.

81
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,180
Win elections.

82
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,060
Any celebrity.

83
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,580
Oh, yes.

84
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,860
Right.

85
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,000
Trying to help Democrats.

86
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,840
I forgot how that election turned out.

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,460
That's right.

89
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,660
They lost.

90
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,940
Hard to remember.

91
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,940
Sometimes we've talked on the show, haven't we, about how I did also work for Will.

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,220
i.

93
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,220
am's

94
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,140
comedy company service.

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,420
Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,080
Dip Dive.

97
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,540
Yeah.

98
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,180
He had his own streaming platform for a while.

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,240
This is like almost a decade ago at this point.

100
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,840
Before Elon Musk tried to do an onion and then bailed on it.

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,060
Way before that.

102
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,980
Before this was cool.

103
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,700
There was a building.

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,100
I don't know.

105
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,620
They apparently had owned this building in Glendale for a long time, but it was the head

106
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,600
operation, head operational base of Dip Dive dot com, which I believe is not even.

107
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,920
Scott, could you Google that?

108
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,700
See if that exists anymore.

109
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,640
It just goes to rerouted to Will.

110
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,400
i.

111
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,740
am and then an ad for something called Zuper Mask

112
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,000
with an X.

113
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,680
Wow.

114
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,060
Really?

115
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,740
It's just the word coronavirus flashing over and over.

116
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,380
And then stay home, stay.

117
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,400
We're going to discover together what Zuper Mask is all about.

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,660
I think he's selling like a cool mask.

119
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,440
I think Will.

120
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,960
am using the valuable Dip Dive URL.

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,500
It says FU 2020, another clever bleep like the cat meow.

122
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,800
Wow.

123
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,040
It's taken a very long time.

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Oh, it is a very sleek.

125
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,500
It looks like a Bane mask.

126
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:16,960
Oh my gosh.

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,460
He's selling Bane masks to fight coronavirus.

128
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,360
Will.

129
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,440
i.

130
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,600
am is selling Bane masks to battle COVID-19.

131
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
How much can you buy one of these with?

132
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,440
Let's find out the price for Zuper Mask.

133
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,000
Zuper Mask with a Z?

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,260
Z-U-P-E-R?

135
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,420
With an X.

136
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,760
Oh, Zuper.

137
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
That's even better, actually.

138
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,140
The X as Z pronunciation is guessed on my part.

139
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,640
Wait, but I'm clicking on Zuper Mask and then it's taking me to no more of a website.

140
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,840
What?

141
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,580
First drop sold out.

142
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,920
Go to ZuperMask.

143
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,820
com to find out when drop two will be released.

144
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,540
It's sleek black and white just like iPhones.

145
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,940
You are on ZuperMask.

146
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,620
com right now?

147
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,800
No, that's Will.

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,440
i.

149
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,240
am redirected from Dip Dive.

150
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,800
com.

151
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,540
Now I'm on ZuperMask.

152
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,020
com.

153
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,280
Okay, when does wave two drop?

154
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,440
This is possibly.

155
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,620
I'm not sure, but they cost $300.

156
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,320
What?

157
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,900
Of course they do.

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,060
But we already have drop two of the vaccine.

159
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,900
That's a good point.

160
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,960
Don't they need to rush out drop two of the most expensive mask you've ever heard of?

161
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,420
I think that, yes, that should have been rushed out.

162
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,100
Old Navy and stuff and ordered pretty decent masks from both of them.

163
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:48,960
And now I'm getting a number of emails of like $2 for a three pack of masks.

164
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,260
So I think they're priced to move right now.

165
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,400
I don't know that this is the best climate for a $300 ZuperMask.

166
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,200
Well, I think I figured out the expense because it is also Bluetooth headphones.

167
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,700
Oh, and a microphone inside also like Bane.

168
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,020
Wow.

169
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,180
I don't know what technology Bane was using, but you'd have to think Bluetooth was involved

170
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,740
unless it was just super janky.

171
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,920
It was made like a 60s animatronic.

172
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah, that's a good point.

173
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,760
I mean, the Bane from the last Nolan Batman.

174
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,360
I mean, Jason, Bane's mask was to continue helping to inject venom into his veins, which

175
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,260
is like the steroid that Bane was taking.

176
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,640
But he's also venom separately.

177
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,220
Whoa, I didn't even think about that.

178
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,100
That's weird.

179
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,820
Whoa.

180
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,280
Tom Hardy is Bane who…

181
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,320
Tom Hardy is the epitome of like early 90s extreme characters.

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
Yeah, he takes venom, but Tom Hardy is venom.

183
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,760
Is venom.

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,260
Wow.

185
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,340
What an interesting start to this episode.

186
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,980
ZuperMask also injects venom slowly into your bloodstream.

187
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,840
So that's worth it.

188
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,040
It's the same thing.

189
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
And only two hours for a full charge.

190
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
So check out will.

191
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
i.

192
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,780
m, but we're here to talk about theme parks mostly, including Universal

193
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,020
Studios.

194
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,040
And wait, well, let's like, we can jump all around.

195
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,940
This episode is meant to be a catch all for our general Universal Studios thoughts that

196
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,540
couldn't fit in our Secret Life of Pets episode on the main feed.

197
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:20,800
But we're also here to talk about the big dog, the new dino in town, Indominus Rex,

198
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,240
new on the Jurassic World's ride, which opened two years ago with a different Indominus Rex.

199
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,340
It always, it's the same format of finale with a dinosaur fight, but this one can do

200
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,400
so much more.

201
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,820
Yeah, it's a full body dinosaur.

202
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:39,960
Yeah.

203
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,080
And boy, is it very impressive, is it?

204
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,540
Yeah.

205
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
Did they, I mean, I guess I'm getting out of myself.

206
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,220
They moved the old one.

207
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,900
That's what people seem to be saying.

208
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,180
Coaster 101, the website, has a good side by side before and after the major changes

209
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,220
to Jurassic World, because in addition to the ending dinosaur, there's an Indominus

210
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,280
that comes out before the lift hill and there's a new dryosphere where previously there had

211
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,080
just been bloody white boxes.

212
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,880
If you notice, I didn't remember what was there.

213
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,940
I missed the blood.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
There was not really blood anymore.

215
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,420
And now there's the gyrosphere, which speculating that it's like, oh, I think they took the

216
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,440
gyrosphere from the picture car section of the studio tour and put it in the ride.

217
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,540
Oh, interesting.

218
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:27,980
Okay.

219
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay.

220
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,260
The gyrosphere being the weird glass ball that the kids get trapped in that has a Jimmy

221
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,620
Fallon ride video in Jurassic World.

222
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,200
Yes.

223
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,260
Which is subject to like any time there's a construction permit or patent filed at Universal

224
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,520
in Florida, everyone's like, all right, buckle your seat belts, gyrosphere attraction.

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
It's going to happen.

226
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,320
And it just never happens.

227
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, yeah.

228
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,220
I think there's, I've seen all there's patents, I think as well.

229
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,100
Like you go, it's like the gyrosphere.

230
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,040
I don't know that they've, I've, I've maybe I've heard this or maybe I'm making it up

231
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,840
is that they haven't figured out the technology to make the gyrosphere work like it should.

232
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,920
It's a rolling ball that also has like non rolling elements.

233
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,220
That's pretty difficult.

234
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,260
So I think that's obviously that would be in their plans to do something like that.

235
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,380
But it seems easier to invent a CGI version of it for a major motion picture as opposed

236
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,220
to make this science fiction real life.

237
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,600
Sure.

238
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,580
In five years.

239
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Speaking of not figuring out tech and I don't want to just stay on this.

240
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,180
But of course I kind of do.

241
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,540
The super mask launched one month ago.

242
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,760
What?

243
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,940
It took him that much pandemic.

244
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,020
Like I don't know.

245
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,920
And they're probably showing him fake graphs like real.

246
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,160
This thing is going nowhere.

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
This virus will be raging out of control for the next 10 years.

248
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,860
If you corner the Bluetooth mask market, the premium Bluetooth mask market, you'll have

249
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,800
no competitors.

250
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,260
Wow.

251
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,640
Great.

252
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Take as much time as you need.

253
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,060
Let's just try to get this thing out by 2025.

254
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,740
Well I mean global pan.

255
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,260
What was the last global pandemic?

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,060
1918 or something.

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,580
So it'll be ready for the next one hopefully in 100 years.

258
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,060
Although the way things technology speeds up, you know, hopefully, hopefully it takes

259
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,660
100 years.

260
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,540
You're always at risk with these things of being so 2000 and late.

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,020
I have found a number of Bluetooth masks on Alibaba for about $50 or less.

262
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,440
Bluetooth masks are a thing in general.

263
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,580
I think they are kind of a novelty.

264
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,660
Most of them are like displaying a little LED light show.

265
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,380
Oh yeah.

266
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:41,860
Yeah.

267
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,600
Headphone or microphone.

268
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,520
But yeah, I feel like.

269
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,720
Can you get a Bane mask?

270
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,740
Oh I wonder, can you get a Bane mask?

271
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,340
This is a yeah, that's a good idea.

272
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,000
A Bane looking Bluetooth.

273
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,580
This is a market.

274
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,620
They're appealing to no one because to want something like this, you have to be a douchebag.

275
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,040
But douchebags have been going out in public without a mask the entire time.

276
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,300
So why would a douchebag spend a bunch of money on the Google Glass of masks when they

277
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,640
don't want to, what they enjoy doing the most is coughing on everybody and pretending nothing's

278
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,100
going on.

279
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,440
Right.

280
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,420
I see what you're saying.

281
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,620
I'd have to take a look.

282
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,380
I am not looking at the mask.

283
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,140
$300 seems a bit steep, I will agree with you.

284
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,020
And seems like you could just use your regular headphones and regular mic.

285
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,820
But maybe, but if Will's, if Will Ams just trying to get like his 20 rapper friends to

286
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,560
buy them.

287
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,040
Yeah.

288
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,400
It might be, that might be priced to move if you have upwards of $200 million.

289
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:44,960
Right.

290
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, he's at a high end.

291
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,440
It's a sharper image sold a mask.

292
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,620
That's what this is.

293
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,040
Yeah.

294
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,200
So maybe, you know, I do think I'll be wearing a mask on a plane forever or other spaces

295
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,120
that seem crowded.

296
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,180
So I don't know if they can show it off in a store.

297
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,320
If I can go back to the old office and there's a prototype.

298
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,580
Oh, the old, the dip dive.

299
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,580
The old dip dive office.

300
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,740
If that's back, we're making viral content for super mask.

301
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,240
Yeah.

302
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,580
So just any joke that you can think of that represents super mask in a cool hip light.

303
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,760
Superman, a character he created.

304
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,200
I wonder.

305
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,660
That's a pitch that could work for dip dive.

306
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
If you get your old job back.

307
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,180
Well, I've two point dip dive zoo point.

308
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,640
Oh, Superman.

309
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,360
Hold on.

310
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Google Superman.

311
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,180
These episodes at higher risk of careening out of control.

312
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,560
I might connect it back by saying another good idea for a Bluetooth mask is one that

313
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,400
looks like a raptor face and that moves and it moves along with what you're saying.

314
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,060
Like if you had a full realistic raptor face.

315
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,020
Oh, yeah.

316
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,280
Like the Chewbacca mom.

317
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:54,980
Like the.

318
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,360
Oh, yeah.

319
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,060
Exactly.

320
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,660
That also a good idea.

321
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,920
Chewbacca mom masks that work against COVID as well.

322
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,160
That are just an old thing.

323
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,340
Oh, yeah.

324
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:04,700
Yeah.

325
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,620
We're also joining the Mask Innovation team on the downward slope of this.

326
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,060
Yeah, I don't think there's a Superman Superman character, but yes, soon, hopefully you're

327
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,020
ready to go with it.

328
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,400
Just get it out to him.

329
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,040
ASAP.

330
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
So the Jurassic World, the big finale.

331
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,420
Yeah, you guys both saw that.

332
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,060
Oh, right.

333
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,380
Because it was not running my return to Universal.

334
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,800
I went like six or seven days before it officially reopened.

335
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,660
It was the end of the taste of Universal event and they just soft opened like 70 percent

336
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,760
of the rides and they're like, have at it, folks.

337
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,300
Sure.

338
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,820
Some kind of dry runs getting them.

339
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,220
It's a little bonus for you guys.

340
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,960
Yeah.

341
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,680
We saw the tail end of that event.

342
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,260
You might have gotten to do it, but you were a little too early.

343
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,680
Yeah.

344
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,980
Well, I believe I was getting in the car in the parking garage and I happened to look

345
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,960
at Twitter and some maybe on the show account and there were pictures where it's like they

346
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,680
just opened Jurassic World.

347
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,280
It was like six, even six o'clock at night.

348
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,700
So they opened it for like an hour, hour and a half before the end of the event.

349
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,900
So you were still there.

350
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,260
I was still there.

351
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,580
Yeah.

352
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,360
You didn't go back.

353
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,140
I didn't know.

354
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,180
I didn't go from Jurassic Parking down to Jurassic World.

355
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm ready on that.

356
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,260
I would go back.

357
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,780
That's that's as far as you could.

358
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,120
Well, Transformers, I guess, is the furthest that's technically furthest.

359
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,580
Yeah.

360
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,120
This is a big habit of mine.

361
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,980
When I've had a Universal Annual Pass, there's I've definitely like it's like a fifth of

362
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,600
the time I go to the lower lot.

363
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,340
I am too lazy to go to the lower lot despite having bought the annual pass.

364
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,540
It's a big haul as much as I was praising the Starway.

365
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,300
Love being on all those escalators.

366
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,900
Just a lot of time.

367
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,660
And it always I also used to live so close to the bottom of the hill.

368
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,540
And it was the started to have the effect of when Homer is stuck in traffic and then

369
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,300
all the way back in the nuclear plant lot and then that right to his house.

370
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,720
Sure.

371
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,900
It was kind of would feel like that sometimes.

372
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,540
I read.

373
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:05,840
Yeah.

374
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,880
The whole summer of Transformers, though, I had the annual pass and a couple times that

375
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,500
summer I parked down the hill, got on the tram, went all the way up, went all the way

376
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
down to the lower lot, did Transformers and then left.

377
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,500
Well, so, you know, solo.

378
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,260
Solo.

379
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,580
Yeah.

380
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,480
Yeah.

381
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,860
Who would do that with me?

382
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,200
Yeah.

383
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,900
People are calling this the best summer ever.

384
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,880
Summer of Crunk or whatever anyone's saying.

385
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,500
It's crunk is far too old of a word.

386
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,560
That sounds like it'd be in a song played at Universal Studios.

387
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:38,900
Yeah.

388
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,200
Ja Rule's Summer of Crunk.

389
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Ja Rule, LMFAO.

390
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,300
From summer 2002.

391
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
So I guess I guess it worked.

392
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,700
Should we start with the Jurassic?

393
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,780
Yeah, might as well.

394
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
We're kind of in it.

395
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,140
Yeah.

396
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,280
Yeah.

397
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,060
How do we like this robot, everyone?

398
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,000
We saw it.

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,080
Jason didn't get the pleasure.

400
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,720
I watched a bunch of videos.

401
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,260
It's amazing.

402
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,620
It's so great.

403
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,060
It's really amazing.

404
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,740
Yeah.

405
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,600
And truly like, yeah, makes, as we were saying, and I'm assuming on our first Jurassic World

406
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,280
episode, we were like, it feels like it'll be better, right?

407
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,660
And yes, they wanted it to be better.

408
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,500
And now it's better, a lot better.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,720
And the only gripe I would have with it is when I went on it, the timing was a little

410
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,840
off because so basically the old way that it would happen is that you're going over,

411
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,780
like you're being evacuated out of the building.

412
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,960
And then, you know, the shot that's in all the commercials, the T-Rex roars out of the

413
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,180
shadows right at your car and you drop.

414
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,300
So now you kind of do, now they've changed that whole top area into like a habitat, I

415
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,520
guess.

416
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,000
And there's some dinosaurs there.

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,180
And then you turn the corner, which would normally just kind of be dark and you see

418
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,720
the Indominus Rex and he's massive and he's just kind of like stalking back and forth.

419
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,140
He's like moving back and forth.

420
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah.

421
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,680
Turning that head, big turn radius on the head.

422
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,020
Very articulated.

423
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
This is, there's a lot of articulation going on.

424
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
And then the T-Rex comes out and roars.

425
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,220
It's a little unclear exactly what they're fighting over.

426
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,400
It's I'm not sure.

427
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,960
It doesn't, it's not like it seems like the Indominus Rex is going to attack us and then

428
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,200
T-Rex.

429
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,080
I think that's maybe the idea is that Indominus Rex is a threat to us and now T-Rex is saving

430
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,780
us like in the first Jurassic world.

431
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,880
Yeah, that's what I was going to think.

432
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,600
It's just mostly a nod to like the T-Rex inadvertently being the hero at the end of the first Jurassic

433
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,800
world.

434
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,260
Because you've got Raptor also involved in this.

435
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,720
That's the same kind of order of unveiling, which that Raptor is very great too.

436
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,340
The Raptor is not new, but it's pretty astounding.

437
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,520
Aaron had not seen any of these characters, I guess just the two, but super impressed

438
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,340
by the Raptor too.

439
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,280
This whole thing, I think with this piece, the Jurassic world plus up is fantastic.

440
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,480
I think this is a little hard to deny.

441
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,100
stop there.

442
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,900
They did go back and add the last little bit.

443
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,300
I think this bit too, this was the old like right before you went up the lift hill, you

444
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,660
know, there's just some scratch marks and a like fakey billboard.

445
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,680
And then they, you know, left the scratch mark, but then it's ripped through the billboard

446
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,580
and there's a little indominus head poking out trying to get you.

447
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,700
And that's a nice little touch too.

448
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,320
Yes.

449
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,100
So that's the original indominus head, I think.

450
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,000
That's yeah, that's why I saw a couple.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,480
That was what was there before at the top of the hill when we went, what is this?

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,020
Is it?

453
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,780
This was supposed to be a big, massive dinosaur battle.

454
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,120
Remember the leaked photos of the two great beasts battling and it was like his head.

455
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,000
And then like the, he comes out and he goes, Hey, stop it.

456
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,080
And then goes back in the same one.

457
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,620
We know.

458
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah.

459
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,900
Yeah.

460
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,500
Just a head before and now you got that full body.

461
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,600
It's right over.

462
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah.

463
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,040
Yeah.

464
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,600
The full body.

465
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:56,920
Yeah.

466
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,860
So that's why I asked, I think on the last episode, Scott, if you were okay with it,

467
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,660
because it is giant and you do go under it, which is really impressive.

468
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,360
Yeah.

469
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,800
You get that scale, but the building is pretty big.

470
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:08,820
Yeah.

471
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,760
It didn't, didn't freak me out on that level.

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,980
I'm feeling very like fear conquer.

473
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,600
I have to say.

474
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,780
This is what I forecasted and you were saying you didn't think that would be the case, but

475
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,380
yes, I don't want to, I don't want to give it away of a future episode, but there was

476
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,120
some bravery that happened the other night.

477
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,120
Oh yeah.

478
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,720
Yeah.

479
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,140
I don't know.

480
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,200
We'll get to that either.

481
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,440
Also like, like it was like Fast and the Furious supercharged.

482
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,920
Scott Gardner was so supercharged.

483
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,760
He was crisscrossing a theme park, like run out of time.

484
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,120
I got to do some rides, got to do some rides.

485
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,740
And I was like, oh, I thought we were finishing these free tasting nibbles.

486
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,560
Yeah, I know.

487
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,700
I was really, well, who cares?

488
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,540
We can talk about it.

489
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,140
It's the, we went to this Knott's event, which was so fantastic.

490
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,120
And I think just because I've been, I have been doing all the attractions that used to

491
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,840
scare me.

492
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,100
Yeah.

493
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,020
In this case, Jurassic worlds really enjoyed it.

494
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,920
Um, but you know, mummy, I'm launching, I'm back on that thing.

495
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,440
There's something, I maybe I just hadn't done a launch in a while.

496
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
I do wonder if that launch is slightly more intense than the Florida one.

497
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,760
Am I making that up?

498
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
I think it is actually.

499
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,980
I think the launch is more intense than in Hollywood.

500
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,400
Hmm.

501
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,660
Maybe that, maybe I had that one in my head.

502
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,900
If that is a slightly more intense launch than others, uh, maybe that's why it freaked me

503
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,480
But still did it, enjoyed it until the bizarre ending of that ride.

504
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,220
Yeah, of course.

505
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,620
Um, but then we got, we got to go to this Knott's thing and yeah, I was all hopped up.

506
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,180
I know I was like running around like a kid, like, come on, come on guys.

507
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,200
I think just because I just was assessing, I'm looking at this coaster, like I'm seeing

508
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,100
what this thing does.

509
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,000
I could do this.

510
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,340
I could do this and I don't want to second guess it.

511
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,560
And I'm so excited to be back in theme parks.

512
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,620
And I did the ride silver bullet and just really jammed over there.

513
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,160
Also subtext, a couple of drinks in.

514
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,620
Sure.

515
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,220
That's all I'll come back to.

516
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,180
Always a component.

517
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,120
Not 10 though.

518
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,400
No, no, no, certainly not.

519
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,140
They didn't give us that many pull tabs.

520
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,700
Yeah.

521
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,760
Um, but I, uh, yeah, I just had the confidence on it and I did it front row.

522
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Uh, was so excited to do it.

523
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,220
I have not done a lot of, um, dangling coasters.

524
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,240
Um, that's not the proper term.

525
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,820
Suspended.

526
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,080
Dangling leg coasters.

527
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,300
Cause I am scared of it.

528
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,520
Danglies, dangly footsies.

529
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,100
Um, I, yeah, wait.

530
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,020
So, so I'm rushing you guys over there.

531
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,000
I only, it seemed like you were down in general, but did you have some trepidation over the,

532
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,180
the suspended element?

533
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,400
Uh, yeah, yeah.

534
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,340
I was like, oh yeah, that's the one with the legs.

535
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,840
I don't know about the legs.

536
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,720
I don't like, but, uh, but I can't, I don't think there's a scenario.

537
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm trying to think of a ride.

538
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,620
I think if everybody wanted to do X two and we were at six flags, I probably do it for,

539
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,180
for, I, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be not doing it.

540
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm not going to have a flashback to me as a kid.

541
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,640
Yeah.

542
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,540
That's a challenge.

543
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,940
Like you weren't meaning it to be a challenge, but you laid down a challenge and I said,

544
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,800
well, let's do it.

545
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,760
Let's, let's do this.

546
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,120
I did not sit front row though.

547
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,760
Sure.

548
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,960
I did not do front row.

549
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,840
I think I was, I, I would do front row actually again, though.

550
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I would do it next time.

551
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,900
It's fine.

552
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,660
I love the dangling part.

553
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,440
It was that up to dangle.

554
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,340
I love it.

555
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,480
And for me though, the, I was not expecting, I guess, cause it had been a few years since

556
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,980
I had done a suspended coaster like that.

557
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,440
Maybe not since dueling dragons closed.

558
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,680
I think that's what the G forces.

559
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,420
I was like, Oh, my brain, like I can feel my brain stem.

560
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,280
Like I was like, Oh, am I going to have a headache?

561
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,460
And thankfully I did not just in the, in the like corkscrews and the loot did I go

562
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,180
like, Oh, that is new.

563
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,440
And then when we got off, I was fine.

564
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,140
Yeah.

565
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,000
That thing corkscrews the hell out of you.

566
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,600
Yeah.

567
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,220
And, and so, yeah, I, there was once or twice, I think I yelled to Mike.

568
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,840
It's like, I don't know what direction we're at right now.

569
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,740
You made a noise and it's the same way.

570
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,800
A similar noise on that is when we were sitting next to each other on hang time,

571
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,360
which we've talked a lot about on the knots, which is a terrifying coast where

572
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,220
you go 90 degrees to get to the top.

573
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,660
And then it's like stalls you at the top for what feels like a minute, but it's

574
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,620
five seconds, but did you just make like a noise?

575
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,900
Like there's a noise that comes out of you that came out of you on silver

576
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,380
bullet on the first, like, I think it was the first,

577
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,720
that on hang time on the lift hill.

578
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,880
I think it was on the lift.

579
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,080
Cause I like the hang.

580
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,580
I like the top of hang time.

581
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,020
Well, yeah, cause you're the itemizer.

582
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,460
Yeah.

583
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,280
You love it.

584
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,860
You love, you want to jump off the, which building in Vegas is Jason going to

585
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,280
jump off of?

586
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
Oh, what do they call it now?

587
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,680
The strat is it the, it's just called the strat.

588
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,000
Jump off a building.

589
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
He wants to one day, one day.

590
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,100
Yeah.

591
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,460
I will jump off a building of $20 a night hotel room.

592
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:55,340
Like the very notable historically designed building that now is on the

593
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,600
list of like, Oh, maybe don't maybe stay somewhere else.

594
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,760
Sure.

595
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,720
Like to look so it's like, Oh, maybe just walk through it.

596
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,240
You know?

597
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah.

598
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,800
But anyway, that came up, they, that came out during a quarantine that Jason is

599
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,360
down to jump off with a bungee cord.

600
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,220
To rappel.

601
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,740
I know.

602
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,420
Yeah.

603
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,020
It loves it.

604
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,600
Who knew?

605
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,340
So I'm looking up some stats on this thing just to see, because I did, I did

606
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,120
get off and like, I've never done a coaster with that many inversions.

607
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,540
Yeah.

608
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,020
One more than the In Credit Coasters biggest drop making that the biggest

609
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,040
drop that I've done.

610
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,240
Right.

611
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,680
I'm just feeling great.

612
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,400
I'm so glad to be on the other side of what you were guessing.

613
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,100
Can I guess the manufacturer?

614
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,020
Yeah.

615
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,040
Is it B&M?

616
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,940
B&M.

617
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,280
Nice.

618
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,120
Dueling Drei and Mabillard.

619
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,620
Yes.

620
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,440
How'd you know?

621
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,100
That, uh, I, well, cause I think they did Dueling Drei.

622
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,960
I think they've put in a lot of suspended coasters.

623
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,600
Oh, gotcha.

624
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:51,900
Okay.

625
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,520
If it's suspended, it might be that.

626
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,380
What is it when it says G-Force three and then no further, uh, the

627
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,560
word or qualification, what does that mean?

628
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,220
What does it three, what does it measure G-Force?

629
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,140
I think that's the number of moments where you feel G-Force.

630
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,920
Cause there was like three like moments where it was like being pushed.

631
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,520
Guys zero G-Roll, whatever that is.

632
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,860
Yeah.

633
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,620
I don't know what that is.

634
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,260
I checked after this cause I said right after, cause you were saying you weren't

635
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,440
sure you were going to do Velocicoaster and I said, I bet you could, if you

636
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,500
would this, if you did this and Velocicoaster I think is like maybe 10,

637
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,440
12 miles per hour faster.

638
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay.

639
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,640
But that's not 30.

640
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,200
Well, that's what I'm, that's what I'm going to say.

641
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,520
Like this ride is like silver bullets, a little bit old and like that clunks

642
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,880
you around a little bit.

643
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,340
Yeah.

644
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,980
And I think, um, Velocicoaster distracts you with a lot of like sets and

645
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,320
landscaping and that kind of thing.

646
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,700
I bet Velocicoaster is just a smooth, fast, crazy ride, but I don't think,

647
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,100
I don't think it's, it's definitely not, I bet like twisted colossus or X2 or

648
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,560
anything where they, or hang time where there's an extra element that makes you

649
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,300
feel like you're going to shit in your pants.

650
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,740
I don't think so.

651
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,200
Yeah.

652
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,060
Bigger draw a hundred 40 is the biggest on that, but I'm getting there.

653
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,520
I don't know.

654
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,240
I'm not opening it up.

655
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,460
Yeah.

656
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,780
The drop is to me, the drop is not, I don't care anymore about the drops.

657
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,820
I used to be more worried about like drops.

658
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,140
Now I'm more worried about like on twisted colossus where basically the

659
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,360
sensation is they're only holding down your legs.

660
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,900
So it really feels like you're going to fly out of the car the whole ride.

661
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,940
Like there's extra stuff like that or X2 or you're dangling, but

662
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,420
flipping while it's happening.

663
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,400
We're like that stuff.

664
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,420
I go, I don't know.

665
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,140
Um, but yeah, with two velocity coaster, like you're nice and you're in there,

666
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,440
right?

667
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,820
You got the restraints.

668
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,840
Um, yeah, but I mean, I had such a blast.

669
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,340
I was so psyched on silver blum watching videos the next morning.

670
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,220
What's happening to me.

671
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,740
Wow.

672
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,800
Chillin out.

673
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,400
The one that what has to happen obviously is that we all have to go to Frightfest.

674
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,520
That's a different, I don't like that.

675
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,020
You don't have to.

676
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,300
That's so annoying to me.

677
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,460
You don't have to necessarily go on the house, but you can go on the rides while

678
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,280
we're in the houses.

679
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,520
But I ended up enjoying these when I'm like scared, but then I'm glad that I did

680
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,900
it just like Tony said about splash mountain haunts.

681
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,640
When we went to the one at knots, we went through one maze, which is not even

682
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,980
close to the most intense maze.

683
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,580
And I think Jason and I both were just like, ah, ah, ah, ducking the whole time.

684
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,340
And then like, few, we got out.

685
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,260
The joy of that ending is that it is over.

686
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,220
And we did the one where we were handed rifles, where we were handed

687
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,860
laser tag.

688
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,480
Oh, yeah.

689
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:33,760
Right.

690
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,460
You could shoot them away.

691
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Scoot them away.

692
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,800
That's not on all of them.

693
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,160
Yeah.

694
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,780
And I will say, um, you know, though I'm, I'm putting on a show of like, yeah, I'm

695
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,220
doing these more advanced coasters.

696
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,400
Now I do.

697
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,800
I prefer it.

698
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:56,240
If there's a big, uh, puffy restraint that I can grip like a giant pillow, like

699
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,100
I can grip like mommy.

700
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,880
Sure.

701
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,160
That helps me a lot.

702
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,160
So that helped me on in credit coaster.

703
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,860
It makes me still more afraid of the tower guardians format because I just got these

704
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,720
little handles.

705
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,000
I got, I got no mommy to hold.

706
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,540
No mommy.

707
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,320
So if there's a, if there's a restraint mommy.

708
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,840
Right.

709
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,400
And so I, that's why I think the gun was good.

710
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,020
So you need like an anime body pillow to go through like the us house.

711
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,860
You need a, you need a waifu.

712
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:31,880
A really soothing, a soothing lightweight wife.

713
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,040
Five pounds or less.

714
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,660
You can do, yeah, you can do, uh, the twist of Colossus at six flags.

715
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,560
As long as you have a giant Lola bunny pillow that's as fixed to the side of the

716
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,100
car or like figment and dream finder.

717
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

718
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,540
Yes.

719
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:49,860
Yeah.

720
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,020
Good, good friends or the soothing touch of a woman or woman rabbit platonic

721
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,800
support body pillow and emotional support body pillow.

722
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,780
That's the way nothing weird.

723
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,340
Okay.

724
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,680
Yeah.

725
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Yeah.

726
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,680
Well, if they tell me you can't have that, this is a roller coaster.

727
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,100
I'll say, no, I need it for emotional support.

728
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,200
That's a weird doctor signed off on this.

729
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,340
That is never, they've never said that phrase at six flags.

730
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,280
You're right.

731
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,100
You can't do that.

732
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,920
I forgot where we were talking.

733
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,040
They don't care.

734
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,560
Yeah.

735
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,360
Yeah.

736
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,920
Just full multi-person sex Trist.

737
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,460
Sure.

738
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,220
Go for it.

739
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,320
Yeah.

740
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:33,360
There's cars one and two got out of the cars and are just having sex over the

741
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:33,680
rows.

742
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,560
There's been orgies on twisted Colossus for sure.

743
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,880
Well, it's pretty twisted.

744
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,020
You put that in the name.

745
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,460
Yeah.

746
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,080
You can't be responsible for what happens.

747
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,600
Uh, I think though, maybe not the fright fest, but I think six flags.

748
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,880
I think if you can do silver bullet, there's a handful of coasters at six

749
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,800
flags that are basically the same.

750
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,060
I was thinking, I think, um, I think Batman, the rides probably in my future.

751
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,300
Yeah.

752
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,260
Those are really similar.

753
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
I think Riddler's revenge.

754
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,660
You would do no problem.

755
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,020
It's the standup one, but you got a big harness and got restraint mommy,

756
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,980
restraint mommy.

757
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,580
Great.

758
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,080
So that one's fine.

759
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,120
And then there's probably one or two other ones.

760
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,640
Huh?

761
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:10,880
Huh?

762
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,800
So maybe the job, maybe the magic mountain trips coming up.

763
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,260
Yeah.

764
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,980
Well, we got to go back to magic mountain.

765
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,540
Yeah.

766
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,820
And I've never done it for the first I ever did.

767
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:26,800
It was as a drive through experience watching darkened, uh, tin soldiers on

768
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,140
stilts, I dance around to faint music out of a car.

769
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,760
Yeah.

770
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,900
I was thinking we have to go back with obviously geo at fright fest, but maybe

771
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,760
we go back before without him or with him either way.

772
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,180
Yeah.

773
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,680
Let's just try not to go on the hottest day of the year.

774
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,620
Like I did one time and I had a pair of like flip flops or sandals or something

775
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,660
by the time I got home, like they, like pieces were separating.

776
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,900
It had been so hot.

777
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,660
Like I didn't throw them in the garbage.

778
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,620
It was like, Oh, these are a lost cause.

779
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,540
Uh, the Santa Clarita just destroyed them.

780
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:00,800
Hmm.

781
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,760
I think it's hot up there.

782
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,180
Yeah.

783
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,520
I don't, am I making up that I don't feel like there's like the most shade at six

784
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,100
legs that seems like a sweltering.

785
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,620
It depends where you are.

786
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,780
We went at more at night and that's really the only time I've been there

787
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,140
other than driving through it.

788
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,460
Hmm.

789
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,400
Um, so we didn't see a ton of like sun cover, like coverage, but there's, it is

790
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,900
so big and confusing, uh, I think there are like areas where there are like trees

791
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,600
and stuff, but I don't, there's a lot of stretches I think where it's just pavement.

792
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,440
Yeah.

793
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,460
Like by the hall of justice, there's no cover anywhere.

794
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,520
A lot of walking.

795
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,760
I'll bring this back to universal with the, with a lot of walking.

796
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,080
I feel like after you went to universal, you said I am not in theme park shape.

797
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,600
Yes.

798
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:46,880
Right.

799
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,120
Right.

800
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,640
And, and Carly, uh, was out.

801
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,620
I had also heard her say that I have certainly said that my body is definitely

802
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,260
atrophied during quarantine.

803
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,740
Yeah.

804
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,580
Uh, well, I, this is all odd to me.

805
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,680
It's like walk it.

806
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,540
You take a walk.

807
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,260
It's a lot of, I know, but I have like a recurring cramp in my right leg.

808
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,120
Now I have to get looked at.

809
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,440
It's on the coast.

810
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,920
There are crips and I was worried about, I saw the cramp and I asked about it

811
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,700
once or twice.

812
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,460
We were together.

813
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,780
Uh, usually if I take some excedrin or Tylenol or something, it's fine, but

814
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,000
you were limping at city.

815
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,100
Well, we went to see what the summer, there's a limb.

816
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,940
Yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't know what it is.

817
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,840
I used to walk a lot.

818
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,760
Do you not leave bed during the quarantine?

819
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,720
I have had days where I've left bed very little, but I'm working on getting

820
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,360
more active.

821
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,400
Like, wait a minute.

822
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,120
I work from, yeah, you work from bed.

823
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,720
That's like Robert.

824
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,320
You know, Robert Evans used to do that.

825
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,920
Yeah, sure.

826
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Brian Wilson did for three years.

827
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,700
So I'm getting, I'm getting back up into theme park shape as well.

828
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,480
But the CDC never said don't get out of your bed.

829
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,160
Well, I, the CDC doesn't advise on how to deal with anxiety and depression

830
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,020
either, but, uh, so, uh, I'm working on it.

831
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,120
I'm working on getting back.

832
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,380
They don't have all the answers.

833
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah.

834
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,560
Uh, I, well, when I said that, look, I wasn't like, I wasn't

835
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,720
like, totally like wrecked completely.

836
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,020
I also started playing tennis again for the first time in 18 years or something

837
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,500
crazy, however old I am, maybe not 18.

838
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,440
Yeah, maybe 18.

839
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,220
Uh, so I remember just like, Oh, my knee, my, my old tennis injury is acting up

840
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,600
again, but then exacerbated by universal.

841
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,060
Uh, but I'm doing Disney what Tuesday?

842
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,920
Yeah.

843
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,540
We'll see if you're going to make you fall to the ground and vomit.

844
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,840
We'll see if nots universal and playing tennis three times.

845
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,260
If I'm ready to go.

846
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,100
Cause I, I'm, I, I can do a 8 a.

847
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,300
m.

848
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,980
to 12 to midnight day standing on my head.

849
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,840
No problem.

850
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,700
Yeah, I did do that.

851
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,100
Okay.

852
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,480
Yeah.

853
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,600
I had a moment or two yet where I took an Advil or whatever at Disney, but I

854
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,880
think I was there from 9 a.

855
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,100
m.

856
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,260
to like 8 p.

857
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,460
m.

858
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,400
The other stepped it down to less hours and you needed medication.

859
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,160
Yeah.

860
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,620
No, I'm not saying I'm on his level.

861
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,180
I have to join him for one of these tennis outings.

862
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,260
You need, Oh yeah, we want Jason, but yeah, look at that leg first.

863
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:09,780
I'm a little worried.

864
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,700
Yeah, no, I know.

865
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,620
No, I'm going to inject you with venom.

866
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,640
Let's be honest.

867
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,960
I did do physical therapy on like my shoulder, my hamstring, like a couple

868
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,780
years ago, cause they were kind of bad.

869
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,480
So it might be one of that like flaring up again.

870
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:22,980
Sure.

871
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,740
So, um, so anyway, we'll be back.

872
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,340
We'll be back.

873
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
We'll all be good to go.

874
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,760
Yeah.

875
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,160
Moving around, um, my shoulder, my shoulders hang, hold it hanging in there.

876
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,980
By the way, I've gotten good again at tennis.

877
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,500
I just want to let everyone know.

878
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,820
I just want everyone to know the first time I played, I was bad and I'm good

879
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,200
again, second doubles conference champion, sophomore year of high school.

880
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,620
Ladies and gentlemen, that is a fact.

881
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,560
I'm not making that up.

882
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,760
You think I'm not an athlete.

883
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,580
You're wrong.

884
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,860
Schomburg city hall.

885
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,580
It says it in there.

886
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,300
Don't make your expose documentary and you're not going to like what you find.

887
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,100
Me and my partner, Jim Conrad.

888
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,340
Cool.

889
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,060
Nickle tennis.

890
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:06,680
Yeah.

891
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,400
Carlson Conrad.

892
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,000
That's right.

893
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,040
So you think I'm a nerd.

894
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,240
You're wrong.

895
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,840
The original bash brothers.

896
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,280
I'm, I'm an athlete.

897
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,460
You were after the movie bash brothers.

898
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,700
You're the tennis bash brothers.

899
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,200
I am.

900
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,420
Yeah, we were the tennis bash brothers.

901
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,420
Um, uh, anyway, whatever we said, whatever we said about this, you were

902
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,720
getting back into shape.

903
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,240
Oh yeah.

904
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,120
That's where I was.

905
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,640
We were, so well, what's because that we, you know, we could talk about other

906
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,280
universal things.

907
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,120
Is there anything to close out to this particular robot?

908
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,060
Well, it is one robot.

909
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,420
It's hard to fill an episode.

910
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,500
Well, yeah, the one robot is really good.

911
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,920
I would say that my, the timing of the robot fight was off when I saw it.

912
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,960
So that was forever ago.

913
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,720
You're talking about 35 minutes ago after tennis and Robert Evans or before,

914
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,500
excuse me.

915
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,820
Um, yeah, at the time it was a little off.

916
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:01,260
So it was like the dominance Rex T-Rex came out like a good solid minute before

917
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,200
we were close to jumping down the hill and then went back in.

918
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,880
And then there was like 20 seconds and then we went down the hill and it was

919
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,700
like, all right, wait, that's, I, that's, I looked at the thing.

920
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,140
That's not quite right.

921
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,120
So I had a criticism of this and even looking at what I think is the optimum

922
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,900
way it's supposed to perform by the criticism of it, it would be that the

923
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,460
prize fear is gone, which I think I've said this before on the show and we all

924
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,260
know I'm like afraid of dinosaur robots still, because we've in the dinosaur

925
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,340
episode, I always apparently look away.

926
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,240
I can't help it.

927
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,560
Even when I think I have my eyes like glued open looking, it's I'm cowering in fear.

928
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,440
Pretend it's a big tennis ball.

929
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,240
Just well, yeah.

930
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,180
Then I have the eye of the tiger.

931
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,560
Yeah, exactly.

932
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,760
Uh, and so you, it's up there.

933
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,980
It's too well lit.

934
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,900
And then you don't get that, that fear.

935
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,380
Cause I remember even like having gone on it after a while, the original Jurassic

936
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,580
world or Jurassic park ride and like thinking, Oh, maybe the T-Rex is broken.

937
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,320
And they really, when it's perfectly working, it is timed really great to just

938
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,360
get you on the way down to scare you as it's happening.

939
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,660
And even, even, you know, going on it a lot more in the last five or 10 years or

940
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,460
whatever, I would still always be like, Oh, maybe it's broken.

941
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,200
They'd wait to the last second to scare you.

942
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,060
And it feels like that per that was so perfect that it is missing that element.

943
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,020
Now it would be really great.

944
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,120
Like the maximum amount of fear on the, on the drop, whereas now it's kind of like,

945
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,740
even when it's working well, it's like the show happens, the dinosaurs were at

946
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,060
each other and then you go down.

947
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:39,660
Yeah.

948
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,500
The optimal thing I think, yeah, that is that that T-Rex barely makes it.

949
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,060
And there's videos where you sort of see that timing, but this has been recurring

950
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,040
even before the Indominus was there.

951
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,320
Cause I've watched videos.

952
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,700
I'm like, what's the, what are the subtle differences in the Japan one or the,

953
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,600
or the Florida one?

954
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,660
And, uh, there's there, yeah, sometimes there's the timing where you round the

955
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,360
corner and the T-Rex is just out already, just yelling for 30 full seconds.

956
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,820
And people, I think if you don't know what the time is supposed to be, it's fine.

957
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,720
Yeah, it's just very imprecise.

958
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,140
This is not, um, Indiana Jones and the Boulder where it's sort of the, it can,

959
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,340
only play out this one way.

960
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,640
It's very like, which I give them credit that it even syncs up at all because

961
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,380
boat rides are a little more, all right.

962
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,560
The stuff generally happens like jump scares and boat rides or, or like

963
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,240
particular moments or spin around and look at this all of a sudden.

964
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,100
That's just not the nature of boat rides.

965
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,600
It's like catch what you catch.

966
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,540
So it's like, it's, it's close, you know, am I making that up?

967
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,040
Like other, other boat rides where like, oh, that happens.

968
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,320
Well, there's a new, there's like the new, like Shanghai Disney pirates boat ride

969
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,600
where I think it's like wifi controlled boats and they can like spin and turn

970
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,820
very so precisely, but that's not the technology from the original Jurassic

971
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,240
park ride or like, yep, pirates of the Caribbean and Disneyland or Disney world.

972
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,620
It's like, you're the mercy of the current.

973
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,440
And it's like, I think the old ride was so dark that you could, like you would

974
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,700
see the boat in front of you, get the show scene and with the T-Rex before

975
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,120
that wouldn't happen.

976
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,480
So like that would always feel like a specialized thing that would feel like

977
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,860
the Boulder moment at the end of the Indiana Jones ride, but now that the

978
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,180
whole thing is brightly lit, I think I saw you turn around and you go, oh,

979
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,080
there's the boat in front.

980
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,540
Oh, there it got the show.

981
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:37,000
And now it loses the specialness of that feeling like it's just happening to you.

982
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:37,840
Sure.

983
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,620
So while it's an amazingly impressive, awesome robot, you lose.

984
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,220
And I'm going to say the word, the intimacy, the intimacy, the intimacy,

985
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,200
which we give you when we speak this close to the microphone.

986
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,620
Yeah.

987
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,060
Well, I'm doing the effort for intimate effect.

988
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,440
But yeah, you lose, you lose that thing of feeling like it's only happening to

989
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,940
you because now you're going like, oh yeah, it just happened to them.

990
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,020
It's going to happen to the people behind us too.

991
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,500
Yeah.

992
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,360
It's like a little show.

993
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,320
So it is a bummer that they couldn't have figured out some terrifying way to like

994
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,600
flash light up, oh my God, it's the Intaminus Rex.

995
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,260
Oh my God, it's the T-Rex.

996
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,720
Now we're dropping again.

997
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,520
I'm sure they've tried, but.

998
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,980
Yeah.

999
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,460
Cause I think they had that water effect in the big, um, you know, the tank that

1000
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:28,200
you go by at the start, that is like queued to a music queue or a sink and it works so

1001
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,980
well, like I love that effect.

1002
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,440
That's yeah, there's a couple of fun water.

1003
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,340
We said this before, or I said this before that I'm happy to get soaked on a

1004
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,740
tri now universal in the tank.

1005
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,040
Yeah.

1006
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,360
The tank is one of the best water effects for sure.

1007
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,600
And that's, yeah, all the stuff leading up to that end scene is perfectly synced

1008
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,140
and fine.

1009
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,300
It's not like you're losing out on a little moment or whatever.

1010
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,380
Like, I don't think you can see that tank moment happen to the people in front of you.

1011
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,460
No, no, not really.

1012
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,740
No.

1013
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,980
So like, you don't know that's coming.

1014
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,440
I forgot, I knew it was coming, but I forgot it was coming.

1015
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,280
I forgot it.

1016
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,500
I got hit with the water and we go, of course.

1017
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,320
So I ponchoed up so stupidly.

1018
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,540
We post, I posted a picture on, on Twitter, but yeah, Aaron as well.

1019
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,120
She was reluctant to go on this, not because of fear, but because of wet, not wanting

1020
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,380
theme park witness.

1021
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,740
She's on the opposite end.

1022
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:21,940
Sure.

1023
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,360
Sure.

1024
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:31,340
Like there's a little bit of landscaping trees by Jurassic world, but otherwise it's

1025
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,240
a lot of concrete and asphalt and it gets hot down there and it gets crowded really

1026
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,960
easy too.

1027
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,640
That's the trick.

1028
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,560
If you've never been to the universe, do this Hollywood, go to the lower lot early

1029
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:41,980
in the morning.

1030
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,700
As soon as you get there, you can knock it out in less than an hour.

1031
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,200
Yeah.

1032
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,300
So, oh yeah, especially in this limited capacity time.

1033
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,740
This is a thing you're making me realize, like kind of a change in perspective from

1034
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,980
kid to adult where I used to be at theme parks and think it is very hot.

1035
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,500
I want the refreshment of getting splashed.

1036
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,920
I will be so cooled down and I'll feel so much more refreshed the more soaked that I

1037
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,160
get.

1038
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,420
And I have not felt that remotely past 21 or so.

1039
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,200
It's, it's akin to I'm so thirsty and I need some refreshment.

1040
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm going to have a big glass of milk.

1041
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,420
That is not where I'm at anymore with that.

1042
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,040
Like now I just don't even like, why did I think that?

1043
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,500
And why, why only is a kid that I think that?

1044
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,820
Well, technically milk is hydrating due to as many vitamins and nutrients and high

1045
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,700
protein content.

1046
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,240
The milk lobby.

1047
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,020
But mentally it might not seem that way.

1048
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,720
I think one, a part of that is that most water rides in California, the effects are

1049
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,520
kind of turned down for much of the year because it's a little more mild in

1050
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,240
Southern California.

1051
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,860
If you want it to cool down by getting soaking wet and you happen to find yourself in

1052
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,860
the lagoon lagoon, you're all set.

1053
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,920
You're going to get soaking wet on Dudley.

1054
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,360
I wouldn't want that.

1055
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,860
You're not going to, oh, it's not going to be satisfying.

1056
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,640
That's different.

1057
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,300
No, a shower is going to do.

1058
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,360
I just no longer.

1059
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,720
I'm like, ah, great.

1060
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,040
I feel so much better.

1061
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,700
I'm soaked in strange water that has machine parts in it.

1062
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:11,820
Yeah.

1063
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,860
The strangers.

1064
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,380
Yeah.

1065
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,480
Your underwear is wet.

1066
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,160
That doesn't like cool you down.

1067
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,440
No.

1068
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:16,620
Yeah.

1069
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,280
That's fair.

1070
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,600
Yeah.

1071
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,340
It's like, ah, just some of my right buttocks.

1072
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,060
It's wet.

1073
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,100
And like an inconvenient amount on my shirt.

1074
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,560
What it did now, I'm curious, would it dip in a pool or the ocean?

1075
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,460
Yeah, of course.

1076
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:30,820
Okay.

1077
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,080
Yeah.

1078
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,300
Yeah.

1079
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,400
Are you asking these questions because you find going on Popeye like refreshing?

1080
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,160
Sometimes.

1081
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,640
I mean, I know you like get like soaked, but I know what it's got saying.

1082
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,940
It was like, it's unpleasant to get like your socks soaked.

1083
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,740
Obviously we know.

1084
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,020
Yeah, it can be applied, but it wakes you up a little.

1085
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,040
It's like getting a bucket of water thrown at you.

1086
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,860
It's not the most sustainable.

1087
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,540
It's not the most sustainable.

1088
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,520
I'll say that.

1089
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:00,480
If it's like 95 degrees out and I'm wearing like short, like a very simple outfit,

1090
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,740
shorts, a shirt or a tank, either one, then all right, fine.

1091
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,960
It's going to be pretty quick to being dry.

1092
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,480
But if I'm wearing pants or something, like I don't, even if it's 80 degrees.

1093
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:12,660
Now that's fair.

1094
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,640
If it's 80 degrees.

1095
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,080
The day we all went to Islands of Adventure together turned out to be the coldest day

1096
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,760
of our trip.

1097
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:26,040
And I went on Dudley Do-Right at 5 30 PM and came off and immediately had to put a sweater on

1098
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,520
and change some of my clothes.

1099
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,840
Only cold day.

1100
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,260
Yeah, the only cold day.

1101
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,720
The hottest day, of course, was the day we went to Animal Kingdom.

1102
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,400
It always is.

1103
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,140
Yeah, it always is hot there.

1104
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,820
That was my prior trip.

1105
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,020
Yeah, it was just like sitting there sweltering.

1106
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,760
It hurts my perception of the place.

1107
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,240
I, it doesn't, even though I associate it with 90 degree heat, I'm still, I'm just watching

1108
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,180
somebody walk through there and going, we got to get back to Animal Kingdom.

1109
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:03,260
I think that's probably well served though by a reservation, by like going to Tiffin's or Yak and

1110
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,940
Yeti and having a long break in the cold with a nice meal.

1111
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,320
Sure.

1112
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,820
But there's, there are places, there's places, there's a lot of places with not much shade.

1113
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,440
Yeah.

1114
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,240
You got to be strategic about it.

1115
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:14,480
Yeah.

1116
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,480
So I just want to, I'm not trashing this ride.

1117
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,320
I'm just saying I do miss that really perfectly timed element at the end.

1118
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,680
But I would say if you watch old videos, it maybe was not that perfect.

1119
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,800
I've certainly had it not be perfect on the ride, but what they were going for,

1120
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,400
I do miss that part of it.

1121
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,200
I also don't know what that room is supposed to be up there.

1122
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,140
It looks cool.

1123
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,940
But is it fake outdoors?

1124
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,780
Or is it like, is it supposed to be like a zoo room that is themed to night?

1125
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,460
Like an interior habitat, like a reptile house?

1126
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,020
Yeah.

1127
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,460
Yeah.

1128
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,560
Maybe that makes sense.

1129
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,540
I think so.

1130
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,720
Because the original narrative of Jurassic Park ride was you're being rerouted into the

1131
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,060
building to be evacuated.

1132
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,800
Kind of a water plant, like a water processing pipe plant.

1133
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,320
And the dinosaurs were not supposed to be in there.

1134
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,920
There was a raptor, there was a T-Rex obviously, but they, that was just, they had gotten loose.

1135
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,840
Now I just caught a detail.

1136
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,140
I think that as you're heading up to the lift hill, I think there is a sign that says

1137
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,480
Tyrannosaur Habitat or Tyrannosaur Kingdom.

1138
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:23,940
I think you're right.

1139
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,640
Yes, you're right.

1140
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,280
So it is completely, they are, there is a T-Rex up there.

1141
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,980
Is the idea that you're being rerouted and hopefully you don't run into a T-Rex?

1142
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,920
That's a good question.

1143
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,360
Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt just told us to be careful and keep our arms in the

1144
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,980
vehicle, I think.

1145
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,620
And they told us that their names are Claire Deering and…

1146
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,020
Oh, Grady.

1147
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,480
Oh, Grady.

1148
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,780
There's an emergency, I have to act fast.

1149
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,880
I better get on and say my name.

1150
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,340
Right.

1151
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,080
They wanted to make sure we know.

1152
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,260
We do know, but we, they just want to make sure.

1153
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,460
Well, the us, the us's in Jurassic Park world, Jurassic World world would know because

1154
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,540
we know who Josh Demaro is.

1155
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:04,980
Yeah.

1156
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,920
Who I saw at Nass.

1157
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,800
Whoa.

1158
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,340
Yeah.

1159
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,120
Wow.

1160
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,100
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:10,720
Mm-hmm.

1162
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,060
Now that's…

1163
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,920
It's like seeing a teacher at the mall where you're like, what?

1164
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,160
It's like when I saw, when I was in elementary school and saw my school's janitor working

1165
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,740
at like Home Depot and he pretended he wasn't, he said, no, I'm not him to be funny.

1166
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,980
And I was so confused, like in kindergarten or first grade.

1167
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,440
Oh.

1168
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,140
And I saw, yeah, he was like working at one of these stores and like, he like pretended

1169
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,700
he wasn't who he was.

1170
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,160
And I was just, I really didn't know what to do.

1171
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,860
On top of just seeing a teacher care or a person who works at the school outside was

1172
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,380
weird enough, but then having them lie to me, I barely recovered.

1173
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,820
Peanuts distress, I guess.

1174
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,260
Really?

1175
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:50,640
Yeah.

1176
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,870
So I'm getting very glum.

1177
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,300
So yeah, so Owen and Claire.

1178
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah.

1179
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,890
They tell us just be careful, but they're not saying, oh, we're rerouting you into the

1180
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,620
dinosaur habitat.

1181
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,400
Be careful up there.

1182
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,080
They don't really say there's just a sign that says that.

1183
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,480
Yeah.

1184
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,780
But there are supposed to be T-Rex's.

1185
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,240
So I guess that what the idea was you're on the tour of Jurassic world and you haven't

1186
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,000
gone off.

1187
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,680
You haven't really gone off.

1188
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,160
I mean, there's a section where it looks like you go off like, you know, in Jurassic park

1189
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,360
where you're supposed to go one way, you go the other way that still happens here.

1190
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,020
But then you go in a place that looks like you were supposed to go there anyway.

1191
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:29,680
Yeah.

1192
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,400
Yeah.

1193
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,720
It's all, it's all good.

1194
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,520
It all works for me.

1195
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,900
I really like the lift hill with the Chris Pratt screens.

1196
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,660
And I agree broken and torn out.

1197
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,680
I think that's an improvement.

1198
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,800
I think all of it is either an improvement or a lateral move.

1199
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,100
You know, some things are much better.

1200
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,320
Other things are like, I kind of like the old way, but like this doll.

1201
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:51,880
Yeah.

1202
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,140
Yeah.

1203
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,000
I just, I think I said in the original, like I wish there was another, it's like we're

1204
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,920
almost getting like the scope and the size moment at the end now as opposed to the start.

1205
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,500
Because when you would see all of the dinosaurs, Jurassic park, look at this.

1206
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,600
And now we're getting this giant stuff.

1207
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,420
We're getting that at the end of the ride.

1208
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,020
But does the endominus not reach, uh, shift that opinion?

1209
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,360
Like, do you now feel like you get some grandeur at the very end?

1210
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:17,600
I do.

1211
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,220
I do feel that I'm just saying, yeah, yeah, that's sort of,

1212
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,640
I still wouldn't mind that earlier, but I guess, yeah, you do get at least like feeling

1213
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,300
like, okay, I can, I can know how big this thing would have been and I would be scared

1214
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,620
of it.

1215
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,840
I should be scared of it.

1216
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,080
Sure.

1217
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,900
So you're getting that at the end.

1218
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,460
You get the, as just as when you went two years ago, you get the grandeur of the

1219
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:48,180
screens, the wide, the wide short screens in the queue, which are so weird.

1220
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,260
The aspect ratio of 32 by four.

1221
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,720
We all know it.

1222
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,220
We're all buying 32 by four TV.

1223
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,620
I think there are gaming monitors that look like that.

1224
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,580
Oh, sure.

1225
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:06,920
I don't like on the, uh, like lining the walls of, uh, baseball stadiums to flash

1226
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,160
when there's been a home run.

1227
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,620
Right.

1228
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,820
If you go to like a Sony store, a Samsung store, you know, if you're ever in a shopping

1229
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,300
center or mall and you're like, is that a, is that a fucking Vizio store?

1230
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:25,860
And like, they have like the $6,000, like next gen model or it's like, do not buy

1231
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,280
this $6,000 TV.

1232
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,060
It will be $500 in two years.

1233
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,820
Yeah.

1234
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,760
You know, this isn't the time to be around forever.

1235
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,240
It's not the super mask.

1236
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,780
No, it's not a super mask.

1237
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,440
Yeah.

1238
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,840
A permanent fixture in our world.

1239
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:45,860
I, I got to see the full loop of videos, which I didn't before, uh, which I do

1240
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,300
think are pretty well done and pretty like classic theme park tradition and the

1241
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,320
actors are fun in it.

1242
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,740
Here's one thing I will, I will say, um, for all of the effort that all of these

1243
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,060
theme parks have made to do the social distance and the six feet, they do it

1244
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,700
long ways, but not.

1245
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:02,840
Yeah.

1246
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:03,760
Yeah.

1247
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,620
You know what I mean?

1248
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,920
Like, like you're still like, it's, you're still next to people.

1249
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,560
Like, what is the point of the six foot markers?

1250
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:18,860
If it's only going up and down, left to right, you're still right next to a big

1251
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,060
group.

1252
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,820
Well, it's, I mean, I guess why are we getting our temperatures taken when

1253
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,400
there's so much asymptomatic spread?

1254
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,940
Like what there's a lot of phobia.

1255
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,400
Maybe that the temperature does cut down on some people that might have a fever,

1256
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,700
but there's a lot, but you could take a Tylenol, like you could get rid of your

1257
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,120
fever taking a Tylenol.

1258
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,440
Yeah.

1259
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:36,720
A lot.

1260
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,640
As I've said, they've called you COVID theater.

1261
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,640
A lot of ways phasing out the temperature.

1262
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,820
Why are they, why are they handing me my taco bell meal in a like rubber

1263
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,940
tray tray?

1264
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,680
Like, this is just, this is theater.

1265
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,340
We, the, how you get it is well documented now.

1266
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,740
Yeah.

1267
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:59,780
Which this is maybe a way that you would get it is being just, I'd never more

1268
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,520
than the Jurassic world line.

1269
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,820
Am I like, I really got, I waited to be vaccinated to come here.

1270
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,860
I'm glad this isn't like, I didn't even do like, I got a little bit to go.

1271
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,220
I was fully faxed.

1272
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,360
Yeah.

1273
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,500
And you see lines like that and you're like, all right, I'd like some of what

1274
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,600
you're doing here theme park, but this one, this is like a, this is a greenhouse

1275
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,420
where COVID could grow masked, but you know, that's that one.

1276
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,440
I was like, had a few days left when I was up there, but I was like, Oh, I don't

1277
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,000
know that I need to wait 30 minutes indoors and switch backs with all my

1278
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,420
closest stranger friends.

1279
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:35,980
Yeah.

1280
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:40,380
That's a whole doing a revenge of them up, doing like rides.

1281
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,480
I had done a million times before.

1282
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,320
So I felt plenty safe there the whole day, but I felt safe because of Pfizer

1283
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,440
less so than NBC universal.

1284
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,240
Yeah.

1285
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:57,080
Look, believe it or not corporations, not always doing the most safe things

1286
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,600
if they're allowed to do it.

1287
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,380
But yes, I agree.

1288
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,900
There's, there's a lot of that stuff where you go, well, why not here, but not here.

1289
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:06,820
Yeah.

1290
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah.

1291
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:07,260
It's the same.

1292
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,900
Why are we taking our shoes off at the airport?

1293
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,140
But unless if you pay though, you don't have to, you pay a hundred dollars a year.

1294
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,500
You don't have to pay to bring a bomb on.

1295
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:16,660
Yeah.

1296
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,440
I pay.

1297
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:17,720
Yeah.

1298
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,200
I came with a free credit.

1299
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,480
I came with a credit card where I get to have a free pass that says I don't have to take

1300
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
my shoes off.

1301
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,980
It seems a bit silly.

1302
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,640
Does it not?

1303
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,020
Sure.

1304
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:28,480
Yeah.

1305
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:36,420
I have a weird little tangent about odd collusion between universal and strange elements.

1306
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,340
So I started, I was with all of this, I was thinking about the opening of the universal

1307
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,820
or of the Jurassic park ride in 96, which we definitely talked about on the original

1308
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,920
episode long ago.

1309
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:55,460
I remember watching the full E special of it and there's a lot of fun novelty, you know,

1310
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:02,080
Spielberg and Goldblum are there, but also Tatiana Ali and Hasselhoff and a bunch of weirdos.

1311
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,440
I was just like, was there any details of that opening that I don't recall?

1312
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,020
And there definitely was.

1313
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,780
That being that Steven Spielberg spent the whole opening hanging around with

1314
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,580
General Norman Schwarzkopf.

1315
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,240
What?

1316
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,540
Who of course led the operation Desert Storm.

1317
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:23,580
What?

1318
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,640
Yeah, I don't know.

1319
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,280
Norman Schwarzkopf was there.

1320
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,240
When you Google Steven Spielberg Norman Schwarzkopf, one of the only results,

1321
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,900
well the only times this has ever really been noticed was by Zach Dunn, fellow comedy writer,

1322
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,480
guy in our scene.

1323
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,960
Like he tweeted about it a couple of years ago.

1324
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,200
So big ups to Zach Dunn for catching this.

1325
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,600
Apparently nobody else has ever found this weird.

1326
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,800
But then there's, I don't know, there's,

1327
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,060
there's articles, I guess they were doing some charity thing together or something like,

1328
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:59,240
so it was like early zoom basically, but to be able to talk to sick children in hospitals.

1329
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:07,760
And then I found this bizarre account of Spielberg and Schwarzkopf doing a proto zoom with a sick

1330
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,000
child in Osby at this opening.

1331
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,400
What?

1332
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,340
There's the Jurassic Park openings happening and then you have to find,

1333
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,500
reporters have to go follow Spielberg and Schwarzkopf to go talk to a kid.

1334
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,860
And it was very awkward and there was a big lag.

1335
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,880
And this is all spelled out in an article.

1336
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,460
Spielberg and Schwarzkopf attempted a dialogue with a child in her hospital room.

1337
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,140
Are there any questions you want to ask me or the general said Spielberg?

1338
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:32,480
What?

1339
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,340
Silence.

1340
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,540
About ET?

1341
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:35,800
Silence.

1342
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,000
Jurassic Park?

1343
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:37,820
Silence.

1344
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,220
The army?

1345
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,220
Okay, yes.

1346
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:49,100
Why didn't the coalition forces continue on to Baghdad and thoroughly end Saddam's regime?

1347
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,340
I didn't quite hear you.

1348
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,540
You asked about Hook, right?

1349
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,200
Well, it was very challenging to do the fake food and the paint.

1350
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,880
It's such a mess on the set.

1351
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,140
Okay, I think you're cutting out.

1352
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,200
Bye little girl.

1353
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,720
And then it turned out that she just wanted to know how the ride was.

1354
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,340
That's what she was after.

1355
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,600
Anyway, this is bizarre.

1356
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,460
Steven Spielberg asking a sick kid if she wants to ask about the army.

1357
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:17,980
One of the weirdest things.

1358
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,540
But then I kept going.

1359
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:19,960
Oh, sorry.

1360
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,440
She's like, oh, no, I just pointing out that.

1361
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,340
So this was 96, you said?

1362
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,620
So video conferencing was around, but imagine the devices.

1363
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:35,440
They would have had to wheel into a hospital and wheel to Universal Studios Hollywood.

1364
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,820
They're like, we have to get a satellite uplink going.

1365
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,900
And it's going to look smeary, folks.

1366
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,360
It's going to interrupt.

1367
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,960
We're not going to be able to get the Tonight Show out tonight.

1368
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,880
Like, oh, it's just going to be an hour of black reschedule.

1369
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,700
Rosie and the bare naked ladies.

1370
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,500
We're not getting into broadcast tonight.

1371
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:05,600
This is a photo you can see of this is some of the first people ever to ride the ride.

1372
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,600
The Goldblum, the kids, Mazzello and Ariana Richards and front row center.

1373
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,040
Norman Schwarzkopf.

1374
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,580
Hurray.

1375
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,960
Which row is G Gordon Lady in?

1376
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:27,100
General Schwarzkopf, do you have any guilt of funding, Saddam America funding Saddam in the 80s?

1377
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,540
And now you're fighting him.

1378
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,040
I didn't quite make that out, but that T-Rex is scary.

1379
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:39,080
For that final splashdown, that's scarier than anything you experience in a helicopter.

1380
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,000
OK, bye.

1381
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,920
Nixon would have been at the opening of Disney World with G Gordon Lady, I think.

1382
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,560
Well, he wanted to be at Disney World.

1383
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,720
Yeah, we talked about that on some episode.

1384
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,420
Yeah, he wanted to be at Disney World, but I think it was the middle of like

1385
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,760
Watergate or the wind down in Vietnam.

1386
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,680
The missing tape was all at the contemporary.

1387
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,480
It was all in a sweet overlooking Discovery Island.

1388
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,120
Yeah, yeah.

1389
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,740
Anyway, a whole other weird other tangent.

1390
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:14,360
Also on Getty Images, a picture of a ref from like not too long after that.

1391
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:22,380
Here's the T-Rex with Newt Gingrich, who got just like an off ride tour of the attraction.

1392
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,720
And I was like, why?

1393
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,760
And I Googled Newt Gingrich, Jurassic Park.

1394
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,940
This guy is a Jurassic Park.

1395
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,760
Oh, really?

1396
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,140
Loves the movie.

1397
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,440
Loves it.

1398
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,920
Talks about it all the time.

1399
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:41,480
In 2015, tweeted Jurassic World is the best in the series since the original Jurassic Park.

1400
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,280
Terrific script with constant surprises.

1401
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:44,920
What?

1402
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:49,340
Two months after the release of the film, Newt Gingrich weighed in on this.

1403
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,540
There's lots of media where he talks about Jurassic Park, including that he said,

1404
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,040
and I quote, why not aspire to build a real Jurassic Park?

1405
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,460
It may not be at all impossible, you know, wouldn't that be one of the most spectacular

1406
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,940
accomplishments of human history?

1407
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,300
What if we can bring back extinct species?

1408
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,800
Newt Gingrich wanted to build Jurassic Park for real.

1409
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,800
The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, why did he now push this while he was in office?

1410
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,680
And why hasn't Pelosi weighed in on her?

1411
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,240
What sci-fi does she want to make real?

1412
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:20,940
Gattaca?

1413
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,180
Just because she want to make a Simone.

1414
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,100
Gattaca is my favorite movie.

1415
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,480
Yeah.

1416
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,600
Really strange.

1417
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:37,240
And like, why don't like if you watch Jurassic, unless he bailed about 25 minutes in,

1418
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,740
maybe he should have.

1419
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,280
Wouldn't you think maybe you should not make Jurassic Park?

1420
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:42,860
Oh, right.

1421
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,300
He just saw the first 25 minutes.

1422
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,520
So yeah, well, he missed the cold open of the he missed the

1423
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,500
pre credits where someone doesn't someone get eaten before the credit.

1424
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,760
Yeah, he also he arrived late.

1425
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,780
Did I miss anything?

1426
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,340
Just saw the technical rehearsals, but before and then went to the bathroom

1427
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,780
when their jeep stopped in the rain.

1428
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:10,020
And then he got a phone call on a massive old cell phone and didn't go back in.

1429
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,700
So he thinks the technical rehearsals like our.

1430
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:17,080
Hurry, if we act right now, we can keep gates out of the military.

1431
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:17,940
Hurry, go.

1432
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,640
I don't have time to finish this movie.

1433
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,360
Yeah.

1434
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,840
Now he's very busy.

1435
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,380
Wow.

1436
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,340
Interesting.

1437
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,220
Yeah, weird.

1438
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,100
And then just sorry, one more little thing.

1439
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:32,940
I also he talks about Jurassic Bark and dinosaurs on his podcast, Newt's World.

1440
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,900
Know what?

1441
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,660
Everybody knows Newt's World, right?

1442
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,480
And I'm sure we share a lot of audience with Newt's World, which is up to episode 250.

1443
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,880
And then I'm curious, like, what else is what's what's he talking about on Newt's World?

1444
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,700
And I pulled up episode 238, Biden's radical first 100 days.

1445
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,680
And you're not unless it has changed since I left to come here.

1446
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,980
And we could just edit all this out if so.

1447
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,740
But here's what I heard on at the beginning of Newt's World.

1448
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,020
Yes, you need to make the most of it.

1449
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,940
Animal welfare certified pork ribs.

1450
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:05,900
Oh, it did change.

1451
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,640
OK, never mind.

1452
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,280
I thought you were going to always going to say forever dog.

1453
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,300
Like, huh?

1454
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,740
Brett, what are you doing?

1455
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,480
No, the wolf is dead.

1456
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,460
This is not a good fit with the race chaser.

1457
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,360
Yeah, I don't like that.

1458
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,440
I don't like being on the same network.

1459
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:29,380
What I heard was the first time I have ever heard this in my life, a podcast ad for Disneyland.

1460
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,420
What for Disneyland on Newt's World?

1461
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,760
Excuse me.

1462
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,640
They do podcasts.

1463
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,320
They do podcast ads at all.

1464
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,280
And look, I'm sorry.

1465
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,800
I just look, I know that they don't support us.

1466
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,000
They don't invite us to anything.

1467
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,600
Disney doesn't help us in any way.

1468
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:52,260
That being said, you're going to advertise on the episode Biden's Radical First Hundred Days

1469
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,900
and you're not going to advertise on a podcast where we talk about like a pseudo

1470
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,560
pseudo crushes on your former CEO.

1471
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,760
What do you like?

1472
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,120
How are we dicey?

1473
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,000
How are we a worse bet for them?

1474
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:14,340
Look, the the the metrics of dynamic insertion of advertising is very complicated and they need

1475
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:20,680
it's safer for them to put it in into the podcast where a chunk of the listeners probably think

1476
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:26,720
Disneyland is the project of Hollywood sickos as opposed to us, a show where they're definitely

1477
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,460
these three are definitely Hollywood.

1478
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,860
They're part of the thing.

1479
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,920
Yeah, just go cut out the middle man.

1480
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,160
Go straight with the sickos.

1481
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,380
Well, but was the ad was new doing the ad?

1482
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,900
Was he like, do you like that one?

1483
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,780
There is a place I got to recommend.

1484
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,560
If you're feeling, are you feeling stressed out, tired, having trouble sleeping at night?

1485
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,820
If so, I recommend Disneyland.

1486
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,020
Add in the place to have a blast and forget about your troubles.

1487
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:51,580
Add personal anecdote, it says on the copy that he's reading.

1488
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,560
I got a chance to go there and I loved it.

1489
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:01,140
Despite not having any Jurassic Park attractions, I did enjoy a dinosaur diorama that I got to see.

1490
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:07,740
I was I left the park promptly after that, but otherwise enjoyed it very much.

1491
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:15,760
So for 5% off your Disneyland ticket, type in new 20 Disneyland.

1492
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,380
com.

1493
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:24,120
Yeah, I, I hope it's dynamic insertion, but let's be honest.

1494
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,560
Come on, Disney, just let us.

1495
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,500
What are you?

1496
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,520
We've spent so many hours talking about you.

1497
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,800
Do some of the hours contain profanities?

1498
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,800
Do we sometimes say that your old rides aren't good?

1499
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,040
Yeah, but also we say so many nice things.

1500
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,060
We are so in your spell.

1501
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,340
We love you very much despite the complaints.

1502
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,160
So who do you want?

1503
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:47,400
Yeah.

1504
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,660
Who do you want to reach out to?

1505
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,100
Teenage influencers who are getting the Huntington Beach police called on?

1506
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:55,860
You know, it's.

1507
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:01,220
No, or the guy, the op-ed guy who's mad that Disney's changing.

1508
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,440
That's who I mean, that's who that's or that Newt Gingrich had his for.

1509
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,540
You don't, but you know what's happening.

1510
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,920
All the people at Disney, they got their headphones in.

1511
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,000
They're listening to hear forever.

1512
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,160
And then the podcast, the ride intro starts.

1513
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,460
And then when Josh tomorrow walks by, they got to quickly like hide it and turn the volume down.

1514
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,960
They're all listening to us, but they can't, they don't want to get in trouble

1515
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,920
because we're the bad boys of Disney press.

1516
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,440
Theme park podcasting.

1517
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,120
We're good boys.

1518
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,600
Every another, every, every other avenue, but for Disney, we're the bad boys.

1519
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,880
We lost them as soon as we said we like to get drinks and get drunk

1520
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:45,240
is instead of adult life, but instead of dancing around it for a minute and a half.

1521
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,340
Yeah.

1522
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:55,840
I may have possibly indulged in a bit of sugar water that goes to the brain.

1523
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,600
And yeah, we don't wear like cabbie style hats all the time.

1524
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,060
Jason once in a while.

1525
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,460
If it's cold.

1526
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,460
If it's cold.

1527
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:11,600
Uh, but yes, you know, we don't have Jack Skellington, like denim jackets or anything.

1528
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,640
We're not their typical good boy media.

1529
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:16,380
Yeah.

1530
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,040
We've never Instagram in front of the purple wall.

1531
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,720
Right.

1532
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,820
I may have Instagram from, I don't remember.

1533
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,320
I've seen it.

1534
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,100
Let's do it.

1535
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,220
We got to get cuter.

1536
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:27,800
You guys.

1537
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:34,440
Well, you know what the answer is and Scott already obviously did the first part of the

1538
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:41,640
daddy's are going to have to emerge and become the wholesome Disney news coverage that Disney

1539
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:46,060
loves only positive, never say a negative thing about them.

1540
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,240
They do not tolerate, uh, uh, uh, insolence.

1541
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:50,840
Yeah.

1542
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:58,200
So the new Avengers campus is a Marvel fans dream come true for Ant-Man to Iron Man.

1543
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,960
You'll end everyone in between.

1544
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,880
You're going to love it all.

1545
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,440
The only thing that the only thing that will shrink at the pimp test kitchen is your appetite.

1546
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:15,520
If you do that, it's okay to be just an absolute right wing psychopath on social media.

1547
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:15,720
Yes.

1548
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,860
Everything else can be awful.

1549
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,980
Every woman who ever comments creep.

1550
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,140
Yeah.

1551
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:28,140
But as long as you're like, golly, g will occurs.

1552
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,820
I thought I was launched into the stratosphere on that mission breakout.

1553
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:38,120
I never want to break back in, but rocket's plan might go a little bit.

1554
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,580
All right.

1555
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,280
He may be called Dr.

1556
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,120
Strange, but I call him Dr.

1557
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,200
Fun show.

1558
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,740
I really enjoyed the outdoor doctor, uh, Dr.

1559
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,360
Strange show.

1560
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,480
I'll tell you what, but I have three sons and I hate people that aren't like me.

1561
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,820
He's that's the kind of girl.

1562
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,540
That's the kind of person that they would.

1563
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:07,760
We had my family at a great time at the park today, but nothing is more satisfying to me

1564
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,140
than knowing Disney shareholders are completely satisfied with their financial fiduciary choices.

1565
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,560
Thumbs up everyone.

1566
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:24,180
Disney premiere is acceptably priced and honestly better than the theater experience,

1567
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,940
but also go do that too.

1568
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,000
I personally have seen Cruella seven times.

1569
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,340
Cruella is one bossy bitch.

1570
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,380
I mean, bossy bitch.

1571
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,320
Hold on.

1572
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:35,740
Hold on.

1573
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,020
Massive strike.

1574
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,660
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1575
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:44,320
I just meant to say that she's a girl boss and that I think all the U S laws should

1576
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,120
revert back to how they were in 1950.

1577
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,240
Well, we love that first part and you cut out at the second.

1578
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,680
I'm the star of Disney's media.

1579
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,680
Of their journalists.

1580
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:05,380
Walt wasn't really frozen in time, but we believe that all that that all U S laws should be.

1581
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:11,320
66 was the time to preserve everything exactly as it is.

1582
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,760
Except union membership.

1583
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,900
We're very happy with the state of that.

1584
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,040
Well, these are the Disney daddies folks.

1585
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,240
Yeah, get used to them.

1586
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,720
They're horrible monsters.

1587
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,560
They're so bad, but look, just you'll hear us do that.

1588
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,120
And you'll know that we're getting free stuff.

1589
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:35,300
And podcast ad placements that make that get us $30 a week.

1590
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,620
Is it worth it?

1591
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,400
I say yes.

1592
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:37,840
I agree.

1593
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,260
Yeah, it's very worth it.

1594
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,820
I can bring us back to universal.

1595
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,340
Yeah, sure.

1596
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:48,020
What have we we've been going a while, but what do we want to say about our universal trip?

1597
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:53,140
Well, my I mean, my postmortem, I had a lot of fun at the taste of universal.

1598
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,620
I did a couple of the not food festivals, too.

1599
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,760
I think the food festivals were nice.

1600
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:02,960
They were they were pleasant diversions from the awfulness of like the past 15 months.

1601
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,420
Such blissful Oasis.

1602
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,100
I think they did a good job.

1603
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,440
It was fun to sample all the foods and eat outside.

1604
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:20,380
I had a Korean what universal was calling a Korean corndog or Korean hot dog, which is just a

1605
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:21,320
regular corn dog.

1606
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,900
But it was at the end rolled in panko crumbs and sugar crystals.

1607
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,200
And that was kind of neat.

1608
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,000
I hadn't really had those, but I had never heard of that before.

1609
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:36,700
But there is like a bunch of kind of crazy hot dogs all around the world.

1610
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,780
So it was nice to get a taste of it.

1611
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,840
I'm sure it's not the most authentic version of a Korean hot dog, but that was fun.

1612
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,480
And I went to the I sampled the new Minions Cafe,

1613
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,880
which is very cute.

1614
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,950
It's over by the Despicable Me ride.

1615
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,920
They put up a new facade on the old grew restaurant and there's a fun neon sign.

1616
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,480
And they have little pudding cups, chocolate, banana, hazelnut pudding cups that look like

1617
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:05,960
the minions.

1618
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,280
They have little fondant minions.

1619
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:07,980
Did you get one?

1620
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:08,500
I did.

1621
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,650
Yeah, it was good.

1622
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,220
And no, no, no.

1623
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,360
Chicken nachos, chicken, Tinga nachos, which were also pretty good.

1624
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,740
Oh, and important.

1625
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:21,520
We always like to see wax paper, restaurant specific cute wax paper.

1626
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,280
That's great.

1627
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,160
They had that.

1628
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,300
Came to the movie.

1629
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,040
That's nice.

1630
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:31,500
I got the sense they were kind of stepping up their food game at a few locations that we ate at that day.

1631
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,660
Got a little picture with the minion.

1632
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,200
I think that's Bob the minion.

1633
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:35,660
Oh, great.

1634
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:36,740
Yeah, we got a selfie.

1635
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,360
Yeah, I forget which one.

1636
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,540
Yeah, I did not have such a great food day at Universal because I was running out of time.

1637
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:50,480
I think I said in the other episode, I got there kind of late and I was leaving and we were going

1638
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,860
to record and I said, well, I need to eat something.

1639
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,860
I'm feeling weak again.

1640
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,660
I'm not in theme park shape, but I need to get protein.

1641
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,560
And I was like, I didn't know what to do.

1642
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,680
I needed just something quick.

1643
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,620
And I'm in Springfield and I'm like, do I wait in the chicken sandwich?

1644
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,560
Maybe I do that.

1645
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,820
But the line's kind of long.

1646
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:07,940
I don't want a crusty burger.

1647
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,600
Anytime I have a crusty burger, it's awful.

1648
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,640
No, it's like fine, whatever.

1649
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,880
So I go, oh, there's the hot dog place here.

1650
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,080
I guess maybe I have a get a hot dog and I'm like, I'm walking along,

1651
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,160
there's only two people ahead of me.

1652
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,680
I look up and I'm like, it's how is it $12?

1653
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
And all of a sudden, like they're gone and I have to step up.

1654
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,380
So I step up and I try, I go, oh, you know what I'm going to do?

1655
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,280
I'm going to ask because there's those Disney hacks where you go,

1656
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,040
I'm just going to get the hot dog.

1657
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,400
I don't want the combo and they'll give it to you.

1658
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,100
Six dollars, seven dollars, you know?

1659
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,600
And I go, oh, can I just get the hot dog a la cart?

1660
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,280
And she goes, oh, we don't do that.

1661
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,160
It's like same price.

1662
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,640
I go, oh, okay.

1663
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:49,740
And then I gave her a credit card, paid $12 for a boring hot dog and some chips.

1664
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:54,100
And then like sadly ate it fast in Springfield and it wasn't bad.

1665
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,080
It was just like that was serviceable.

1666
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,900
Yeah, there was a hundred more fun things I could do than eating a sad hot dog

1667
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,500
alone in Springfield.

1668
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:04,680
Right.

1669
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,040
We miss this, but these places, we've missed them so much.

1670
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,980
Solo hot dog, solo expensive hot dog.

1671
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,840
I made the absolute there's, I'm sure everyone has this experience in their life.

1672
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,280
Sometimes where you go, I made, there were a hundred options and I made the worst

1673
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,200
choice of all the options.

1674
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,380
I could have done anything and it would have been better than this.

1675
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,820
I would have like, it would have been better for money wise.

1676
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,120
It would have been a better meal.

1677
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,340
And I blew it.

1678
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,480
I completely blew it.

1679
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:31,420
It's like humiliate.

1680
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,380
Those do stick with me.

1681
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:39,700
I will be like talking about my wrong meal choice the whole rest of the night.

1682
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,040
Aaron has long moved on.

1683
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,600
You're still talking about this.

1684
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,080
Yeah.

1685
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:49,660
I was like, Oh, I had lofty goals before I could go city walk and grab something or

1686
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,280
whatever, but I was like, no, no, I'm running out of time.

1687
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,140
I need to do something quick.

1688
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,300
Big mistake.

1689
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,500
I got one thing exactly right, which is that am I getting braver on these things?

1690
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,260
Certainly.

1691
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,800
Brave enough to not need alcoholic assistance, not necessarily.

1692
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:13,900
And this also just this being an outing after many months of pandemic newborn

1693
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:21,000
parenting to be in a theme park and free and nice weather and vaccinated and all that.

1694
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:28,440
We watched the gate on the Island new bar rise.

1695
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,340
We were there at 1030.

1696
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:37,280
As soon as we could possibly hit it, got some Mai ties, took them up to what I don't know

1697
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,520
what it's officially called, but I am calling it Jurassic patio.

1698
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,840
It's the seating area up above that restaurant.

1699
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:45,920
Yeah, that's great.

1700
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:53,240
That's really my God view of the, I mean, view of the hills, view of the ride, view of the starway.

1701
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,160
The other way, it's just a lot of tropical plants.

1702
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,340
This is the closest we felt to being in Hawaii.

1703
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,720
This was a great little vacation for mom and dad.

1704
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:05,000
At least that early, nobody up there.

1705
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,460
So you're, you're the hack Jason of just get to that lower lot.

1706
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,580
Definitely do that and get to Island new bar.

1707
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,540
As soon as your stomach is willing to accept alcohol, get a Mai tie down.

1708
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:22,800
And if it's also empty, Jurassic patio is, yeah, that's, that's my new pick of the park.

1709
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,340
It's kind of game changer for that lower lot,

1710
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:29,320
you know, new bar and I, they, I don't think the ice cream was running when I was there,

1711
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,340
but I think they do the crazy shakes are crazy.

1712
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,420
Do I almost did that too.

1713
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,020
And I went, I may as well have said Michael, I don't mean to drive the knife further,

1714
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,580
but one of the things they have introduced at a number of universal eateries is a hot

1715
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,700
chicken sandwich.

1716
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:49,760
And I know I at Mills and I think at the Hollywood and dine, they have that and they

1717
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,320
beyond burgers now at a number of outlets to better, but they have that at the Pym too.

1718
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:55,940
Test kitchen.

1719
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:56,520
I know.

1720
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:56,920
Okay.

1721
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:57,360
Yeah.

1722
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,740
A lot of plant based stuff coming to that Pym test kitchen.

1723
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,880
I could talk about the menu for another hour.

1724
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,360
Yeah.

1725
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,240
Is that going to, maybe that's an episode.

1726
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,600
Maybe we determine that.

1727
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:06,920
Just pin menu.

1728
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,380
Maybe.

1729
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:08,940
There's a Schwarm a cart too.

1730
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:12,760
Schwarm a cart.

1731
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:13,500
Yeah.

1732
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,840
Well, we'll try to get there soon enough for now.

1733
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,960
This is the most recent newish stuff that we've done.

1734
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,500
Have we, have we, have we missed anything about our universal?

1735
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,760
I got to Jurassic patio.

1736
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,820
I got my shout out.

1737
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:25,440
Yeah.

1738
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,300
Young people are wearing big pants again.

1739
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,860
I said that in the last one.

1740
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,600
They're wearing big pants that look like Jinko pants.

1741
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,180
I didn't know about this.

1742
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,600
This just sprung up on me.

1743
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,960
It felt like overnight, but apparently it's been going on for a while.

1744
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,420
And I don't know if I have anything else to say, but I go, Oh, it feels like I'm

1745
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:43,860
young again.

1746
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,300
I mean, I always want to feel like I'm young again, but I feel like,

1747
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,680
Oh, this is what kids dress like back in my day.

1748
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,860
That's a phrase I thought in my head.

1749
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:51,720
Yeah.

1750
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,380
That's what that's going to feel.

1751
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,980
That's going to make you feel very useful.

1752
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:56,600
Yeah.

1753
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,480
Back in my day is occurring to you.

1754
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,040
Back in my day.

1755
01:16:59,060 --> 01:16:59,400
Yeah.

1756
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,340
So, um, that's true.

1757
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,180
Oh, the thing we,

1758
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:05,140
the thing we were talking about, we alluded to on the last episode is that

1759
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,480
Optimus prime is now giving a speech.

1760
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,560
Jason, could you find that?

1761
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,520
Yeah, here, you know, maybe that's, is that the way out of the episode?

1762
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:13,900
Perhaps.

1763
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:14,320
Yeah.

1764
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:14,740
Yeah.

1765
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:15,420
Here.

1766
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,940
Well, then let's start winding it down while we find it.

1767
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,600
You survived podcast, the ride new and you survived the new

1768
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,100
Indominus Rex.

1769
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,500
Um, please keep it tuned here to patreon.

1770
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,640

the ride for three bonus episodes every month.

1772
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:34,000
m,

1773
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,200
Uh, please go to, uh, will.

1774
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,000
i.

1775
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,860
in order to get to super mask.

1776
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,740
com, uh, super mask, according to their Twitter,

1777
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:45,080
uh, though the drops are sold out, but they, it is still the air Jordan of masks.

1778
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,620
So it says in a tweet that gets a lot less likes than our tweets typically get, um,

1779
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:55,960
follows super mask is looking pretty lonely at 636 followers.

1780
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,980
So go support small business support

1781
01:17:58,980 --> 01:17:59,540
will.

1782
01:17:59,540 --> 01:17:59,660
i.

1783
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:05,840
m and his artisan $300 Bluetooth mask endeavor launched, uh, right at the end of the

1784
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,360
pandemic.

1785
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,720
Yeah, that's a, yeah, we'll, we'll all do that.

1786
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,820
We'll retweet a couple of super mask tweets.

1787
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,200
You gotta help them out.

1788
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,720
They give them a little bit of a signal boost.

1789
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,820
They seem like good folks.

1790
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,340
Um, Jason, have you had any luck?

1791
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,280
I have it.

1792
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:17,560
Yeah.

1793
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,940
Um, do you want me to just play it or you want to play it later?

1794
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,360
You set it up.

1795
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,080
Yeah, well we'll play here and react to it.

1796
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,220
Um, yeah, but optimist prime was welcoming

1797
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:30,220
guests back to universal with a message that was very specific.

1798
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,620
It was not just a general like,

1799
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,020
yes, good to see you.

1800
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,680
It was like these trying times have been different.

1801
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,500
I mean, we'll hear it

1802
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,160
Yeah, let's hear it.

1803
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,320
This is Twitter user at cranky J.

1804
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,620
This has been viewed 187.

1805
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,280
9 thousand times.

1806
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:45,740
Geez.

1807
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,680
Super mask dream in those numbers.

1808
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,640
It is so good to see all of you once more.

1809
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:54,320
It has been a tough and trying year, but you know what?

1810
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,860
We did it.

1811
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,420
We did it together.

1812
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,400
Fight is not over yet.

1813
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,580
I can see light at the end of this dark tunnel.

1814
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:09,980
I owe it to all of you for staying diligent, staying smart, staying safe, not believing the hype,

1815
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:13,160
believing in yourselves and believing in each other.

1816
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,480
We must protect one another if we're going

1817
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,920
to make it on this planet.

1818
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:23,240
And although we are built galaxies of art, in the end, you're just like us

1819
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,120
more than it's the time.

1820
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:29,100
I am Optimus drive.

1821
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:33,340
I send this message to anyone who needs to hear it.

1822
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,520
You're worth it.

1823
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,460
You're part of the team.

1824
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,800
I'm glad he got in like I'm Chevy chasing.

1825
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,520
You are not.

1826
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,600
I'm glad he got his taglines in there.

1827
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,280
What about roll out?

1828
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,180
You are one of us.

1829
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,560
You're like that is such a funny speech.

1830
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,040
It's so good.

1831
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,700
It's kind of, it was kind of nice the day it went around like the internet and it was

1832
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,320
like, oh, this is kind of nice to hear.

1833
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,680
But then if you think about it too long, you're like,

1834
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,760
there's some phrases he's not saying.

1835
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,600
Like, like you can see the Republicans buy sneakers to cracks

1836
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,400
through these companies.

1837
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,160
What do you mean when he says don't believe that?

1838
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,180
Don't believe the hype.

1839
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:20,840
I don't know.

1840
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,400
I don't know if that's like, I don't know if that's like a catch all.

1841
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:23,800
They were like,

1842
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:30,400
it's it can apply to QAnon, but it can also apply to like those weird Twitter doctors who are like

1843
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,380
trying to scare everyone every day.

1844
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:32,960
I don't know.

1845
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,680
I'm not sure.

1846
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,260
Maybe I think everything about it

1847
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,940
was designed to be vague enough.

1848
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,920
It's perfectly market tested.

1849
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,820
Like we're all in this together.

1850
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,340
Yeah.

1851
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:43,820
Beware.

1852
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,800
There are little decepticons in every drop of the vaccine.

1853
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,540
You are being tracked.

1854
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,400
You are, you are all now as valuable as the all spark.

1855
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,560
You're being pursued to what end and for

1856
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,320
what reason?

1857
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,160
I don't know.

1858
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,460
If you are vaccinated, watch out for evac.

1859
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,660
He's on your ass.

1860
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:10,640
He will punch you in the chest like he did to Megatron at the end of the ride.

1861
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:16,040
There's one person who has all the answers that we're looking for and she's not talking.

1862
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,400
Melinda Gates, I'm talking about you.

1863
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,580
Tell us the truth.

1864
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,820
What secrets are you holding?

1865
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,220
Pretty odd timing.

1866
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,480
Wouldn't you say divorce right after all this?

1867
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,660
What does she know?

1868
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,620
Autobots to little St.

1869
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,600
James.

1870
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,140
We must examine the evidence.

1871
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,200
All right.

1872
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:38,800
That's it.

1873
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,660
That's it.

1874
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,620
We're out of here.

1875
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:42,320
Goodbye.

1876
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,120
But you made us proud.

1877
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,380
We're proud of you.
