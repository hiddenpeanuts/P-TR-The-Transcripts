1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The podcast, the ride.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome, people of podcasts.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Podcasts.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Podcaststers.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Podcastians.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Citizens of podcasts.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Does anyone know what they call themselves?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Do I do the whole thing?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What? I'm on?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Someone needs to tell me when I'm on.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome, podcast Terrans.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The biggest thing fighting me, do I do that,

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is the opening, was how long

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
it would go.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am Centurion Scott Kierner,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
joined by Nova Prime,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jason Sheridan.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What a title.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Head of the Nova Corps and everything.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, you're right in league

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
with why Nova Prime,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
can I find the name and the notes

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
quickly enough?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do we know Nova Prime's name?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know Nova Prime's name.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wait, I don't.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We've got some work to do.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Joined also by, apologies, I have no more

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
of these terms.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have no more Zandari in terms to apply to Mike Carlson.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I ran out, I'm sorry Mike.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's okay, because you're limited to what the information you have

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
from the ride, the pre-show is.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So it's not like you're dipping deep into the Marvel comics.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You only know the ride.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is the definition of what I only know

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
from the rides.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I looked up other Zandarian titles,

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but those wouldn't read.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Those require explanations.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're right, because

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the entirety of

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
my Guardians of the Galaxy experience is the rides.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I still have not seen any of these films.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, interesting.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Have you seen clips of anything?

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Have you seen Baby Groot dancing to Mr. Blue Sky

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
from the opening of Guardians of the Galaxy 2?

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have not actually.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think you would like that.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think that's maybe the only thing you would like.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Maybe there's a few other things.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Baby Groot dances while Mr. Blue Sky and the other

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Guardians are fighting this big monster.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So it's mostly while Baby Groot dances

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and they're fighting in the background.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why is he Baby Groot by in...

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is the Baby Groot switch?

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
At the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 1,

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Groot sacrifices himself

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
for the team.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He kind of blows up.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I think they take a piece, Jason,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
correct me if I'm wrong, they take a piece of Groot

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and plant him.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And he slowly grows.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So a new Groot grows.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
With a different character.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
At the end of 1, you're like,

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I thought we were saying goodbye to a great character,

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but now in number 2,

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we get to deal with what this is going to be like.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then he kicks off and he's dancing

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so we know we're off to the races.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And then he slowly becomes like

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
petulant teen Groot.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In the later Avengers movies.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well thank you both for explaining

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to me the events

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
of probably some very famous

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and commonly viewed films.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Films.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I know, I know.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now Scott has to be babysat

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
through the events of

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
very popular movies.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well I just, you know, might come up in the conversation

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
here today.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Look, it all sounds

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
very nice. Do I have any

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
desire to watch any of these movies?

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, no, Guardians of the Galaxy.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know, I have long time listeners

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
know, I'm not a big Marvel person.

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If I had to watch any, it might be these,

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
because Guardians of the Galaxy has produced

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
some pretty exceptional rides.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we finally get to talk about it.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is a big one.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is long overdue on our part.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We have had since May

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
2022 to talk about

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
this and we have not

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
all been to Orlando to get,

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
has anyone missed it? I forget when you went before.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I went in November

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
2021. So I saw

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the destruction site.

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This past time, it's

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
like, okay, Guardians is open,

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Moana is open.

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Which I'm sure we'll get to

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in a future episode.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The beautiful

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
fake rocks and water

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
fountains and plant life.

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But operationally,

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
a panic attack. I think it was

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
worse for Jane walking around.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But just observing, like,

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
okay, half of these people

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
are just walking through. Half of these

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
people are stopping dead in their tracks

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to take pictures.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Half of them are reading the sun.

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It just seemed

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
a little confusing.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's certainly some places were close quarters.

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Certainly in certain places.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Very close quarters.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I hear you saying there's a lack of understanding.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is this a thing where you,

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
do you treat it like a line and do you do every step

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
of it or do you just move

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
through at your own pace? Which I think is what you are

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
interested in.

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It was very, the walkways were wide.

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
With the scooter, I certainly

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
was able to navigate through

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
easily enough. It was just,

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think, yeah,

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
if you went at a slower time of day,

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it was probably lovely.

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I like getting wet from the spray.

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I like getting sprayed.

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So here's a preview of

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Journey of Water. That is the name

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
of it. I'm not mixing it up with because we got

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Way of Water. Journey of Water? Yeah, I think so.

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We'll learn that by the time

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we get there. But today, it's

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind.

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm so happy

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
we're doing it finally. This is like

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the best of the best that we get to talk

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
about now that we've finally been

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
in. Big basics

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to talk about before we get

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
into specifics

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and what it is and

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
story and the order of events.

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It is the first

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Disney Marvel

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
ride in Florida.

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They finally were able

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to get away from the

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ironclad but very brief

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
universal contract that

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
excludes most of the characters that they love

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
to make attractions. Which I didn't realize

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
goes back to 19... It was agreed upon

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
in 1994.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow. So then by the time it

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
actually gets

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
built, Marvel is in

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
bankruptcy reorganization.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like Marvel is struggling

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
when it opens

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
even though

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
just run of cartoons

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
in the 90s. Like very

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
kind of prevalent in the

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
90s. But I think the work

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
around is that these characters are not

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
present in Islands of Adventure.

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to not be present

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
on a wall.

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You have to not be present and also they can't

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
say Marvel in the

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
marketing and signs and stuff.

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So they can say Guardians of the Galaxy

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but they can't say Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right. I think they can say Marvel

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
in California Adventure

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now. But they can't

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
do it in Florida.

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And it's really funny that the

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Guardians of the Galaxy have two

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
major league rides in Disney

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
parks because of just

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
like legally what happened.

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like it's just if you said that well

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you know 30 years ago, what

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
ride, what characters will have like big rides?

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You'd be like well certainly there will be

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a Fantastic Four ride and

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
there'll be Avengers and of course...

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
X-Men. X-Men. Yes. What about the

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Guardians of the Galaxy? Oh.

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The characters from the year

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
3000? Yeah. What?

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah. I

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
was wondering that like did you, well your

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
relationship to these characters in this

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
were before the movies. I mean I... Very much

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
its own vibe and different things.

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I will be honest. I had not read, there was a

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
good, something that I think

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
inspired, for sure inspired the

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
movies. There was like a

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
pretty well reviewed run

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
by Abnet

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and Lanning. Yeah.

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That I think got

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
people sort of interested again. It wasn't like

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
a big comic book, whatever a big comic book

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
hit is in the year

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
2010. The 2000s.

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They kind of revitalized all these characters.

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They had this big annihilation

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
storyline and it brought

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
a lot of them to

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the forefront and that's a lot of the inspiration

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
for the movies. Except

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
there

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is a character named Nova.

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There's been a couple Novas.

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Richard Rider and

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Sam Alexander. Those

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
were not used in the movies

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but the Nova core is

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
used in the movies. Yeah, you know you pick and choose

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
some of the mythology but I

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
will say I hadn't read that run

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
before the movies

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
came out.

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I knew Rocket Raccoon.

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know that I remembered the name Drax.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I knew Groot of course

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
because Groot is a funny thing that he only says I am

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Groot. You maybe could name

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
most of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, I don't think I knew

256
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Gamora. In the 90s I don't think as a kid

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I could have said Gamora or

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Drax. I don't think so.

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You were where I am now. Basically, yeah.

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Having been on these rides

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
multiple times. There was a lot of

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
70s characters.

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There was a lot of cosmic Marvel comics

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
in the 70s. Stuff that wasn't

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
like in cartoons. I mean maybe

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
some silver surfer stuff. Rocket was kind of a comedy

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
character and

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So it's funny. It's just funny

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
that there's two major like this is a crazy

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
new coaster and this is the Marvel property

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that it's based on. Which I'm happy about. I like

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the vibe of the movies

273
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
a lot. Yeah. Well and not only that

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
yes. It is inspired

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
some of Disney

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Imagineering's best work of the last

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
decade. Yeah. But also

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
in this year

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and the year that we are wrapping up

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
2023, the only bonafide

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Disney hit Blockbuster.

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
In an absolute catastrophe

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
of a year box office wise

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
for Disney. The only one

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
there's only two that are like clearly

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
wins. One is Guardians of the Galaxy 3

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and one is Avatar Way of Water

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
from last year. Right.

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Which Variety just talked about how

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Avatar made more money

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
in 2023

292
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
than the new most of the new

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
2023 movies. Haunted Mansion, Indiana Jones

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
5.

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The Marvels trounced

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
by the runoff of Avatar from last

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
year. Yeah. It's interesting seeing

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that. The Guardians because the Guardians really

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
did resonate I think more

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
like the first up until like Endgame

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Marvel was very

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
much like had the momentum of

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
like you got to see it all because it's all

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
going to build to one big thing and like

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
even if there was a movie that you felt like was maybe less

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
good or you didn't attach to the characters

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it was like well you got to see it because it's going to be

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
very important at the end. It might have a little connective tissue

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
it's all going to come together. Right. Right. But then as soon

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
as Endgame happened I think people were just like

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
alright well done. I guess we finished

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
it. So then when they start doing a bunch

313
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of new stuff and then and how dare people

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
tap out after

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
22 films and shows.

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's what I said. How dare you

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
think you've had enough.

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But then when they try to launch a ton of new stuff

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and maybe probably overextended themselves

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
then it was like uh oh

321
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
we're like starting in a way starting from

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
scratch I think. And I

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
don't think they maybe expected it. I think they kind of

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
were thinking the momentum would carry all of it

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
through forever. Yeah.

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But so that's why I think Guardians is like

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
well actually that's pointing to like

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the audience really likes those characters.

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like that really resonated

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
with people in a way. It seems somewhat self-contained. It obviously

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
like attaches to the broader

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Marvel narratives but it's like if you

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
could only watch those and have a good

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
experience and not feel confused

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
by well what is that reference and what is

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
this building to. And made enough of

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
an impact that director James

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Gunn is now in charge

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
of DC movies. Yeah.

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Entirely. Uh huh. Which is going

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
great. DC averse just

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
rising and rising straight to

343
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the top. Everybody's happy.

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well yeah there was that video

345
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
that trailer video where it's like

346
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
alright we're going to start off fresh

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
with creature commandos.

348
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was like what?

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well Gunn is going to bring the magic to creature commandos

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
like he did with the Guardians. You know?

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah. You know I guess. Have I said this on the show before

352
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
James Gunn months before getting

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Guardians. James Gunn did a bunch of trauma

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
movies and some other like really small

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
indie type things. Uh huh.

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And like months before getting

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Guardians judged

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
a live show Jason and I did.

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh. That's called the Tournament of Nerds which

360
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I still do it here and there.

361
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He did a couple times. Wow. I think

362
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
so. And it was like literally

363
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
a couple months before and he was

364
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
set to judge again.

365
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And he got Guardians of the Galaxy all

366
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
of a sudden. Wow. Cause like

367
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
what he says I think he like really like

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
went all in on this pitch at Marvel

369
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and got it. And he

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
actually I think had agreed to judge

371
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
before he got this. So he was

372
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
set to be back and I

373
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and another person were like we gotta get Jason

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
out on stage in a Rocket

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Raccoon outfit. Oh yeah.

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We're gonna have the worst smeary

377
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
raccoon makeup. Yes. So we were

378
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
like fuck. James is gonna be here.

379
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We need to do a bit on stage where Jason

380
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is Rocket Raccoon. We have to pitch Jason

381
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
for Rocket. And then

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
before the show happened James

383
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
pulled out. James pulled out went with

384
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jackson Maine himself.

385
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know Mr. Silver Linings playbook.

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Bradley Cooper. Fucking Bradley

387
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Cooper over to Jason Sheridan.

388
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Just because of name recognition

389
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and awareness Bradley Cooper

390
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
was like in front of him all the time. But if Jason

391
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Sheridan had been in front of him once.

392
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's what we were thinking. I could

393
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
have charmed the pants off him.

394
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's what we were gonna do. Yes. We were gonna try

395
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to do it. So anyway. Did you have a sense of how

396
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
because it was pre the voice that we

397
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
all know and love to do.

398
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Did you have a sense of your

399
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Rocket?

400
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It would have been pretty close honestly.

401
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It would have been a little more

402
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
old timey. But I think

403
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
a little gruff New York. I think

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I would have tried to do

405
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
a universal Hollywood

406
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
New York's you know.

407
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hey.

408
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey Mr. Gun. Hey

409
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
it's Rocket. You know.

410
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You like these rock and roll tunes. Why don't you go

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
back a little farther and sing the

412
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
old ones. What do you think?

413
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Boogie Woogie Bugle. My Bonnie

414
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
lies over the ocean.

415
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You ever thought about a

416
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
rocker who likes public domain.

417
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You don't have to

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
pay for those songs.

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is that nice? Give yourself some scratch.

420
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You think it's far to get to

421
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Terra. You know.

422
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a long way to Tipperary

423
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
my man. I like that he's like

424
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
oh. Like he's a cat like a

425
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Grace Clay or he's an old like at skill comedian.

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So like you want a real you want a real lived in

427
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
hard boiled New York voice.

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey Mr. Gunn.

429
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Or if I did a real hard like

430
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Philly dialect

431
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and then that would have made him go like

432
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Philly huh? That reminds

433
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
me of that Silver Linings

434
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
playbook movie. Oh it just brought him right back.

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It was an

436
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
inevitability. So I don't know if I've said that

437
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
on the show before but I swear Jason

438
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
was weeks away from being Rocket Rec.

439
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's how I say it. That's how I tell it.

440
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Weeks away from bothering

441
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
a man. Weeks away from bothering

442
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Mr. Slither

443
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
himself. That's right.

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Geez. Ships in the night.

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Could have been.

446
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well anyways yeah we've arrived

447
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
here. They finally they've planted the Marvel

448
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
flag in Florida.

449
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is a huge

450
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
technological leap forward

451
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
roller coaster. The very first

452
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
ever Omni coaster.

453
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I forgot that they invented

454
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that term. We have advanced

455
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
from the Omni mover

456
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
which spins and pivots

457
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and allows the audience to look at specific

458
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
elements and kind of direct your

459
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
field of vision on rides like Haunted

460
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Mansion or Little Mermaid. And now

461
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
this can be done on a rolly

462
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
coaster. Pretty incredible. What times

463
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
we live in. And I don't

464
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
want to like jump

465
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
too far. We can go through our experience

466
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
of this emotionally. But I feel like

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I heard this. I saw this.

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sounds cool. Alright spins

469
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
you can look at stuff. I watched a video of the

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
guys testing it outside. Going

471
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
on a little like not fully

472
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
track of it. Or finish track

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
of it. Looks cool cool.

474
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Was looking forward to it cool. None

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
of it prepared me for how great

476
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
this was in person.

477
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No I know. I absolutely

478
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
completely agree. I completely blew me away once actually doing it.

479
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I still now I found myself now I've come back

480
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm telling people Guardians is great. They're like what's

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
so great about it. Well it's the individual

482
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
car spins so you can like look at stuff and you can rotate around

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and nobody's getting it. Nobody everybody's

484
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the same as I was. Just like oh yeah sure

485
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
sounds okay. I like you you have

486
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to you have to have been baptized

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in the Omni coaster

488
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to have the enthusiasm about the Omni coaster.

489
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I completely agree.

490
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It is like I don't like

491
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
yeah it's I was trying to describe it to people

492
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and I felt like I was doing a bad

493
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
job. I couldn't articulate exactly

494
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
what it was but I was like

495
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think I said something along the lines of like I've never been

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
handled like this on a ride.

497
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes. I've never been like

498
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in some giant. You still

499
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
new technology after new technology

500
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
managed to find weird creepy ways

501
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of saying everything you like. That's true.

502
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You find a specific

503
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
ones for every new one that comes along.

504
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I've never been finessed. I've never been

505
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
caressed. Caressed

506
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
like this on a ride.

507
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I've never been taken care of. Finished. I've never been finished like this.

508
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I've never been completed like this.

509
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I was about to say I've never been completed.

510
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I swear. But now I'm a completer.

511
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You kept going

512
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and spoke more normally

513
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
about it at some point was like

514
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you know you go on a coaster you expect

515
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
certain

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
ranges of movement

517
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and like high grids you

518
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
launch forwards you launch backwards

519
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but then the surprise of the drop

520
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is unusual. It's unusual

521
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
but it's still I've been on a thing with a drop.

522
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But this

523
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
is so much unusual movement

524
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
forward

525
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
backwards spinning

526
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in dark net so it's your little

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
off kilter. And the lights

528
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
are adding to that

529
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
like you never I mean it's like Space Mountain

530
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
where you never really get a

531
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
handle on where you are and what's

532
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
going on and then you add spinning to that

533
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
you add lights that sort of never stop

534
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to that. The project

535
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the lights the star projections

536
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
are really good. I mean it's really

537
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
new.

538
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The screens are really good

539
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in it. And I

540
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
definitely watching videos that was able

541
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to follow like the story

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
more. Yes.

543
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Coming off it I had no

544
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
idea what happened. Even ride

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
even the gist you

546
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
get the gist of it riding. You get

547
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
the bear. But I don't think I knew

548
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
when you were launched backwards that is

549
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
the big bang. You have been sent back

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in time to the big bang. That is

551
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
not remotely.

552
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But it's a great it's

553
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
you know it hits that theme parky thing where you like

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you don't need to know any of this.

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're not going to be lost. You're going to enjoy it

556
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
no matter what. You land at the same

557
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
space as Space

558
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Mountain where like there is

559
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
no story. Yeah. Like you could

560
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and then those specifics

561
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and if you learn about it and

562
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
you know understand it more it

563
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
adds texture to the experience. But like

564
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
if this is just if all you if you just go

565
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
on this once and get get handled

566
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
you're going to have a good time.

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you get handled on this ride you're going to

568
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
love it. This

569
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and then I guess I can say this and

570
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Velocicoaster

571
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I haven't been on rides in years

572
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
where I just every like

573
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
every different like movement in turn I just

574
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
go wow wow. Like I'm making

575
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
noises like confused

576
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
noises that were also delight.

577
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Like I couldn't kind of like whoa

578
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
what. OK. What.

579
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Like we did other

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
new rides that were good good

581
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
rides but I wasn't sort of shocked

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
by them. Oh yeah.

583
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Which is a tough bar for a ride. But

584
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
obviously like the greats

585
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
are the ones that do

586
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
something completely new. Yes.

587
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I guess like the first time we went on like the

588
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
trackless ride vehicle for Pooh's Honey

589
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hut we were like huh what.

590
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Like the first time you're in a new

591
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you're being handled a different way

592
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is very surprising and if it's fun

593
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it's fun it's really fun and I felt

594
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that way on this ride and then on Velocicoaster

595
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
at Universal.

596
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Maybe a good new tagline for Walt

597
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Disney World in general. Walt Disney

598
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
World will handle it.

599
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Will handle it in a new

600
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or unique way.

601
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Get handled like

602
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you've never been handled before.

603
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's really

604
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
what's going on here. So you're going to love the way

605
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
we handle you. We're going to. We guarantee it.

606
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We guarantee it. We guarantee it.

607
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The

608
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
what other first

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
this is the first roller coaster

610
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
at Epcot. Right.

611
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
First Disney

612
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
backwards launch.

613
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Backwards launch which is catching

614
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
on I feel like.

615
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I was trying to figure that

616
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
out. What is the history

617
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
of backwards

618
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
launches and because I could not

619
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
you hear it's the first Disney one.

620
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Right. OK. So other places have done it.

621
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And you're like where. Like there's not like

622
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a really famous or prominent

623
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
backwards launch unless I'm wrong.

624
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I looked up examples but do

625
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
you guys in your head have all there's this.

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No.

627
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't. I'm not really. I mean Hagrid's

628
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
has a lot of tricks but I

629
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
think the backwards version is you go

630
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
backwards. No no I'm just

631
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
saying tricks in general. When you go backwards

632
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it's the old edge of

633
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
the track.

634
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh yeah sure. Yes.

635
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah. And that's what a lot of them are.

636
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Like other. There's a

637
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
lot of rides that launch you backwards

638
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and then you're right. Like kind of you

639
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
hit it. It's different than Hagrid's but like you hit a

640
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
dead end and then you and then go forwards

641
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
from there. Like yeah sorry.

642
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But there's not a ton of

643
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
backwards launch and then you stay backwards

644
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
or backwards for a very long

645
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
time. I think they'll run like

646
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and I forget the names of all the Superman but

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
the Superman at Magic Mountain which is just sort of a

648
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
shoot you up and then back down again

649
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
but I think they will run that backwards

650
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
sometimes. That's called Superman

651
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Escape.

652
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Superman Escape from Krypton. And

653
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think it's maybe. I think

654
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
do they change it? Like it's sometimes

655
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
it's backwards and sometimes it's forwards

656
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
or the different tracks do different things.

657
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This is something called Full Throttle

658
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
at Magic Mountain that launches backwards.

659
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's not the bar though. It's not the Full Throttle

660
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Lounge. Right. The very

661
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
classy Full Throttle Lounge.

662
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's something called Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast.

663
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't know where that

664
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
is even.

665
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And then something called

666
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Revolution at Blackpool Pleasure

667
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Beach in England where you get to

668
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
they launch you back and you kind

669
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
of like stall up at a certain point for a

670
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
while and you stare at a different show

671
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
building that has a big Wallace and Gromit

672
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
on it. Oh that's not

673
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
bad. I don't like that.

674
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I mean that's not related but it's just

675
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
an added bonus. Right, right, right. But

676
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I mean it is this is

677
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
instantly I would say the

678
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
most prominent backwards launch.

679
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah. I think so. For sure.

680
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And it kind of in a way it isn't a backwards

681
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
launch. It is a regular

682
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
launch because the vehicle never

683
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
changes direction but your cars

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
spin. Which lets you

685
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
get out of the territory because it's so

686
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
like you got to switch tracks basically

687
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
if you want to go backwards. Oh yes. For the most

688
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
part. Again, listener

689
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
correct me if I'm wrong. If you've been on a great backwards

690
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
launch let us know. Let us know.

691
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We don't want to neglect it. But yeah

692
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it's kind of you get a backwards launch and then

693
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you spin around

694
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the other way and then keep spin.

695
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's every type of direction

696
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
you could be on a coaster.

697
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The manufacturer of this

698
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
ride is the roller coaster

699
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
company.

700
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is like comic books where

701
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I read someone's name

702
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but haven't said it out loud.

703
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Vcoma or Valkoma.

704
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh yeah I've seen that name.

705
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Other Disney collaborations

706
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
with them include Big Thunder Mountain

707
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Tokyo and Paris, Gadgets

708
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Go Coaster. Oh wow I didn't realize that.

709
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Expedition Everest.

710
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Wow. And

711
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
one of my first

712
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
launches maybe I've ever

713
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
ever did was Rockin

714
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Roller Coaster. Baby's first launch.

715
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That was my first launch too.

716
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Which is a very intense

717
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
even still is a very intense

718
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
launch.

719
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It was terrifying the first time

720
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I ever did it. I would not

721
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't need to do it again.

722
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
If a group was doing it I would do it again.

723
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But that's a little bit

724
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
above my threshold.

725
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I was pretty shocked the first time I did it.

726
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Fun certainly but like

727
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
that's right above my intensity line.

728
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Right. But Slinky

729
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
they have figured out how to do

730
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
gentle launch. Like Slinky Dog Dash

731
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
has some gentle launches.

732
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah. Yes. Very relaxing.

733
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well this new when you get a new

734
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
just smooth ride. It's

735
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
so much of it is that.

736
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Just the fact that like if Slinky Dog did all

737
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the same stuff but it like jittered

738
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
around a lot. You'd feel

739
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
over handled. Yeah.

740
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If Slinky would like turn and point

741
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
you at things to show you toys

742
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in Andy's room. Oh sure.

743
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then yeah. We're going to have to start

744
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
spinning on everything I guess after this.

745
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It is kind of hard to go back

746
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
once you go on a ride that like it feels

747
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
like this state of the art.

748
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I mean it's not really that hard but it's like kind of

749
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
where you're like imagining it. Like I am

750
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
upset that we don't have a Velocicoaster

751
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
or a Cosmic Rewind in California.

752
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Because I think if I went on for the first

753
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
time I'd be like I'm going back tomorrow

754
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
or next week. Like I have to figure out

755
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
how to get on this soon.

756
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah.

757
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I totally agree. It like haunted me.

758
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I was like we only have a couple

759
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
more days and they're busy days.

760
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm not going to get back on this. It might be

761
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
years before I'm back on this and I've been

762
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
thinking about it a lot. I think about both

763
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of these coasters a few

764
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
times a week since coming back.

765
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We did. One member

766
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
of our party was kind of defeated

767
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
by this ride. The Celestial

768
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Ison kind of

769
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
center. I was wondering if you would

770
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
address this. I will address this.

771
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Jane

772
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
immediately

773
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the train pulled up to

774
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the offloading

775
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and was like I am going to be sick

776
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and ran to

777
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
a trash can.

778
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I think I

779
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
was not that sick but cast

780
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
members very

781
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
prepared with both

782
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
barf bags and little

783
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
bottles of water and these

784
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
little hand towels which

785
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
we found in our luggage.

786
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We sold a little hand towel.

787
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This one was not used.

788
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The one that she dapped her mouth

789
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
was thrown in the garbage.

790
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But this one we

791
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
just kind of ended up back with us

792
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that I think we found the other day.

793
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So you got a free towel from All Fisky World.

794
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Got a free towel and free little bottles

795
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
of water. Now this is what I

796
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
like. This is the smart Jason where he

797
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
really takes advantage of situations.

798
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You got a free towel from All Fisky World?

799
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The smarter way to take

800
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
advantage would be because you had

801
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
to endure, Jane had to endure the vomiting

802
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
in order to get the towel. The smart

803
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
move is to fake the vomiting.

804
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Fake it and get little waters.

805
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now here was how the

806
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
events, we all

807
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
got off. She was sick. I sent you

808
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
guys onward and I'm like I have

809
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Pepto-Bismol. I'm going to sit with her

810
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and make sure she's okay.

811
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There is a bench at the exit

812
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
which is unusual and I was

813
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
told that bench was

814
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
added later on.

815
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
A puking bench. It's a

816
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
collector's help bench because what happened

817
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
as we were sitting on the bench

818
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I watched the two track

819
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
sides. I watched the trains

820
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
pull up and I watched a handful of

821
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
people also get

822
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
off this ride and walk

823
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
to the trash can and be

824
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
sick. I watched

825
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and I talked to the chaos members.

826
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I was just like, does this happen a lot?

827
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They're like yeah, it happens.

828
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Did you see

829
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
you don't have to say specifically, did

830
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
you see a large amount of puke being

831
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
produced from everybody including Jane or

832
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
was it just sort of like a dry heave?

833
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I think there was some dry heave, some spit

834
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and like bit so.

835
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Did anyone throw up a full set

836
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
of wings from the Odyssey?

837
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I didn't see

838
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
your scotch bonnet pepper went in.

839
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That would have hurt

840
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
on the way out. Food

841
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and wine, people are eating and drinking

842
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
all morning, all afternoon

843
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and then getting on Cosmic Rewind. I wonder

844
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
if it's common for people to throw up a ton

845
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
of food or it's just like

846
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that weird sick

847
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
feeling. When you're in a car and you're

848
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
reading or you're looking at your phone too much

849
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and you're not driving.

850
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I wonder if it's kind of more like that

851
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
or you were seeing just tons of puke.

852
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I think it was just a combo

853
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of like we had shared

854
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
a fruit and cheese thing

855
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and I think she

856
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
had too much dairy

857
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and like a side salad

858
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
at the end. Meanwhile

859
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I talked about this on the live show.

860
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That day I had eaten

861
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
cold brew Danish

862
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
crab legs

863
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
crab claws

864
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
half a cheese plate.

865
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And I just hopped on

866
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Guardians and hopped right off.

867
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You ate the crab, you were eating it on

868
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the ride as well. I was eating it on the, I was cracking

869
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
crab claws as

870
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Congo was playing.

871
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Let's, here cut this if this is too much information

872
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
but at some point in this conversation I do

873
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
remember you saying to Jane

874
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that you were, you're

875
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
worried in general about it because

876
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
she mainly ingests

877
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
salad, coffee, and weed.

878
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, that is

879
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that is part of

880
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
our food thing. Obviously

881
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
in Florida we weren't having

882
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
much of that.

883
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You know, just the salad and

884
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
coffee. Well coffee can upset your

885
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
stomach and too much greens

886
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that's too much, that's a lot of

887
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
fiber, you know.

888
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And too much other greens and ooh

889
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
now we feel like we're on Cosmic Rewind all the time.

890
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yeah.

891
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I am Groot.

892
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well I was, yes

893
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
everybody go we got so high we thought we were

894
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Groot. That was a teasing line.

895
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Whoa you were smoking baby Groot man.

896
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He's a little bud.

897
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh that's enough, Disney wanted to get into the market

898
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and make joints that look like little

899
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Groots and like you're burning the hair

900
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
of Groot. That's right, that would be

901
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
great. Yeah, start making that dough.

902
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They need alternate revenue streams

903
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
ESPN shit in the bed and all that.

904
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Eiger, your answer is

905
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
They're starting that ESPN

906
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
betting app too.

907
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You're going to be able to bet on

908
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
your phone. Oh goody.

909
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Just start character

910
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
themed joints.

911
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I hear ya. Yeah.

912
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Then you can skip all that stuff.

913
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

914
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That was kind of like a teasing

915
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
line. I think that was more of like

916
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't know if this is ideal for your

917
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
stomach but she loved the ride.

918
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
She had a great time on the ride.

919
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I think her

920
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I think she said what she

921
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
did her in was

922
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
there was a moon

923
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
set piece towards the end.

924
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You're shot around the moon.

925
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And I think she was focusing

926
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
on that to try and

927
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
steady herself. That was a very dizzying

928
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
effect to stare at things.

929
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Your car is going around

930
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
it and you're also spinning

931
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
like I think it was too much.

932
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't blame her at all. You have to

933
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
calibrate to what this is

934
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
because as the sounds you were

935
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
making Mike it is very like

936
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
oh huh, oh okay.

937
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You don't have

938
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I certainly didn't have experience

939
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
of a similar thing. So you're

940
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
figuring out on the fly how do

941
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I not get sick in this?

942
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And it was I think by the

943
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
you know I barely survived not getting sick.

944
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
She you know she has a bit

945
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
more of a gentle stomach and I

946
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
occasionally do but often

947
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
it's an iron stomach.

948
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's either

949
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
iron or gentle.

950
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Which is not ideal either.

951
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So it'll surprise

952
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
you. But yeah so

953
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I think like this ride

954
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I had

955
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
never seen so many people come off a roller

956
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
coaster and run for the

957
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
trash can. And then the

958
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
other you know I was taking the

959
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
elevators but the design

960
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I was like there are a lot of stairs

961
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
up and down after you do

962
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
this dizzying ride.

963
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yes you walk right downstairs

964
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I think out of the exit

965
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
area yeah. A space mountain too.

966
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's true. There's some

967
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
guardians yeah if you're on the second level of guardians

968
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
at the California

969
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
California Adventure one you have to

970
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
go down this big set of stairs.

971
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I will say this

972
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I could feel in my

973
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
stomach where you

974
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
could get sick. I was I didn't feel

975
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
like I was going to throw up or even close to it.

976
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But I could feel that like kind of again

977
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
being in a car and

978
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
looking down your phone and like the motion sickness

979
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
of it. I could feel where it would have

980
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
happened. Yeah yeah well like what

981
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
part of your body could have been activated

982
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
but wasn't. You know when I had a bigger

983
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
problem which I wrote out

984
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I was fine I just had to like cover my eyes

985
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but we finally towards the end

986
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
of the day did

987
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Remy's Red Tattoo adventure

988
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
which was mostly very pleasant.

989
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think we talked it up in our in our episode

990
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
with Taryn I think we were very positive

991
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
about it but I also think like thinking

992
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
back on that episode we were like finding things to

993
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
poke at about it and when is it in the timeline

994
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and this and that. I feel like it maybe

995
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
maybe I at least underrated

996
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
the ride in my head a little and I was

997
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
on it thinking like well it's not like a blockbuster

998
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
like this it's not like

999
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Guardians but it's a you know

1000
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
what it is it's a it's a wine ride

1001
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
it is like it's perfect for World Showcase

1002
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
it's perfect as like it's it's gentle

1003
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
it's it's culinary

1004
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
but there was one part and I don't

1005
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
remember at some point something

1006
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
about 3D and screen

1007
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
curvature and yeah probably

1008
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
overindulging all day

1009
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
finally added up into like

1010
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
okay glasses off looking down

1011
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
got a tap which doesn't happen to me

1012
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
a ton but it did on there

1013
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
sure yeah there's opportunities

1014
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that I've got. Also unconventional

1015
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
movements added in with

1016
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
3D glasses. Yeah

1017
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
yeah yeah. This

1018
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
ride I was I

1019
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
did keep my

1020
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
glasses on because I

1021
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
wanted to be able to see all the like

1022
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
story beats and I'd seen

1023
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
a video of Mr. Morrow riding

1024
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
it. He kept his glasses

1025
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
on so I was like okay I feel better

1026
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
but I put my baseball cap

1027
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
in the well the Dirty

1028
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Mesh Pouch. Dirty Mesh

1029
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Pouch a cousin of the Dirty Yellow

1030
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Strap of course.

1031
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And now we welcome to the show the newest

1032
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
member of the five timer family

1033
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Mike Losing His Hat on Guardians

1034
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Cosmic Rewind. Mike Losing His Hat. I look I know

1035
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
it was going to come up here and the discourse

1036
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
around it is um is really

1037
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
wild. People can't stop talking about it since

1038
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we brought it up. Everybody has very strong

1039
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
opinions on it.

1040
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Every like we said this a couple

1041
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
weeks ago is that

1042
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I left my hat on as

1043
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
did Griffin who was sitting next to me.

1044
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And Mr. Morrow also

1045
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in a video had a hat

1046
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
on. Yes. But I think a tighter

1047
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
fitted flat brim hat. And

1048
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in case you didn't listen

1049
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I had a bag of some of stuff

1050
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that I was trying to cram into the little

1051
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
thing in front and I didn't even think to sort of take

1052
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
off my hat. I don't always wear a hat so

1053
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
sometimes I forget I'm wearing it. And

1054
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
what happened is I lost my hat basically

1055
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
on the launch. And

1056
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
in the photo we have a photo which I forgot

1057
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
totally the order of events on this

1058
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
because I did not this is new information. It's

1059
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
kind of fascinating that it is like right

1060
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
at the that somehow

1061
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
for all this talk of uh you've

1062
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
lost that and Griffin took his off

1063
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
the photo was taken at a precise

1064
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
hat oriented moment. Yes. But I think

1065
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
one of you is even holding your hat.

1066
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Well we're both holding our hats I believe. Griffin

1067
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
has more of a hold on his which is how

1068
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
he kept his and I'm holding my brim.

1069
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And the hat slipped

1070
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
out of my hands is my

1071
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
memory now. I see. On the launch.

1072
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Because all of a sudden it moves and I went oh

1073
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
shit yeah my hat is oh yeah

1074
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm wearing a hat and then it slipped out of my

1075
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
hands and that's when I just turned to Griffin and went well

1076
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
lost my hat. This is the backwards

1077
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
launch

1078
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
or? Yes on the backwards launch. That's when they take

1079
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the photo. That's the first yeah the photo.

1080
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And then yes that

1081
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
is when I had my interaction with the employee who

1082
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
was uh couldn't have been

1083
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
more irritated with me for

1084
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
just asking a question. Which is where the discourse

1085
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
which is where I'm a little bit

1086
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
online people are like well yeah

1087
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
he should have been rude to you. And I'm like

1088
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I didn't yell

1089
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
at him I didn't say I want my hat

1090
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
give it let me walk the track. The people

1091
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
who listen to this show and root against

1092
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
the hosts.

1093
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm glad Mike finally

1094
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
got what was coming to him. I forgot

1095
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't know and also as Griffin pointed out

1096
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
like the woman whispered to her you may

1097
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
want to take off your hat to him

1098
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
not to me. You know what it wasn't even I wrote

1099
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
because I remember the the term it was like

1100
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
you may want to hold on to your hat. Yes. Right right.

1101
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Which I keep thinking is like something that would be said

1102
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
at the beginning of like an old VHS

1103
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
where like a youth pastor raps.

1104
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yes. You may want to hold

1105
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
on to your hat. Here we go.

1106
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Jesus is the way the only

1107
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
way.

1108
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The person walked

1109
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
by on on

1110
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
my side of the train

1111
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the roller coaster

1112
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
car. It is called a train.

1113
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm not making that up.

1114
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But someone did really

1115
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
quick. No one mentioned the glasses

1116
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
but they were like careful with that hat.

1117
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I feel like. Yeah. Well

1118
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
so I lost it and then I think I was

1119
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
very nice. So is there a chance you get

1120
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
it back. Like how does that work. And that's when

1121
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
the employees very rude to me

1122
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and acted like well somebody told you right that

1123
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
you should take it off. Kind of.

1124
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Not really. I don't want to

1125
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is different than take it off. Yeah. It was like

1126
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I didn't defy someone who told me

1127
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to do that. It's like I'm just asking if it's possible

1128
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to get back and how would that work. And that's when

1129
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
someone's rude to me. But then they were very

1130
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
not the other chaos. Everybody else was very

1131
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
nice. Yes. Until

1132
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
until the listeners. Until yeah until

1133
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
we saw some of the listeners who were like yeah

1134
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
asshole should have known better. Yeah I guess.

1135
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't know. I wasn't

1136
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
entitled. I listened to every episode

1137
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
with my finger up ready to wag

1138
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
at the host. A wag from me.

1139
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I forgot I said I think I forgot.

1140
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Like I wasn't even. But again you're an old

1141
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
theme park cast pro. You know

1142
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that is how unconventional

1143
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the motion of this ride is.

1144
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Don't call him old. Be careful man. I mean

1145
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
you're a young person. Yes. Yeah.

1146
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah. I am. You're

1147
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
thank you so much. Yeah. I'm going to edit

1148
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
it. I'm going to edit the old part out anyway.

1149
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So don't worry about it.

1150
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I go through and make a pass anytime.

1151
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Now here's what I think. If

1152
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
they really want

1153
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
if this is like so severe of

1154
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
a thing. Yeah. That it needs to be said

1155
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and not just repeat

1156
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
like don't put it on the cast members. Don't make

1157
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
them say it over and over. This should have been

1158
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
attained in the dialogue

1159
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
from Centurion Talmeric.

1160
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Right. Original character

1161
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in this ride as portrayed by Terry Cruz.

1162
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Confusingly Terry Cruz

1163
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
in his pre-show spiel

1164
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
which I nodded to at the beginning of the episode also

1165
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
is very firm about no

1166
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
recording devices allowed.

1167
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Right. Which is weird because you

1168
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
can watch many videos. Everyone

1169
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
records this ride. Taken by recording devices.

1170
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So this the one that they gave to Terry Cruz

1171
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
is ignored

1172
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
roundly. Yeah.

1173
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But the one that seems like the most important

1174
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the biggest like divisive

1175
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
issue is not addressed by Talmeric.

1176
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
No. Talmeric doesn't talk about hats.

1177
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
There should be a lot more hat stuff in the

1178
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
pre-show. Every character should remind

1179
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
you to remove your hat. Yeah. Yeah.

1180
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And just one more time real quick.

1181
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because I'll steal it

1182
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
because you know I like the pilfer.

1183
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There should be like a

1184
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
version or the Tom Jones

1185
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
version of you can leave your hat on

1186
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
by Randy Newman but you can't leave your hat

1187
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
on. There should be like a parody of it

1188
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
to just drill it into your head

1189
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that you should you got to take your

1190
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
hat off. This is crazy. Don't leave

1191
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
your hat on. Are you crazy?

1192
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So they should be addressing it

1193
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
in multiple ways I find. Yeah.

1194
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
OK. So that's a plus up. Every

1195
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
single and we want to see

1196
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
icons do it. Yes. We want to see

1197
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Pratt and Batista have

1198
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to do. Right. That's what the dialogue

1199
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
about. Yeah. Funny Batista

1200
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
lines in this. He has

1201
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
a few good ones. He's

1202
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
pretty funny in these movies. I

1203
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
feel like we talked about this before. Is Batista

1204
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
how is

1205
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
does he have the best filmography

1206
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
of? Of a

1207
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
professional wrestler? Of WWE stars?

1208
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
More than Hulk Hogan and

1209
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Santa with Muscles and. Oh yeah.

1210
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You got Santa with Muscles. You got Thunder in Paradise.

1211
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You got what's that what's the

1212
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Suburban Commando. Suburban Commando. Yeah.

1213
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well I think

1214
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Batista I will give him credit

1215
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
for like wanting to do

1216
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
like a range of things and being

1217
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
interested like wants to do interesting

1218
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
things and like isn't too worried

1219
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
about like losing

1220
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
in a movie.

1221
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I have a tough time

1222
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
putting the phrase best filmography

1223
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
on a

1224
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
filmography that includes Stuber.

1225
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I mean. I said

1226
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
a range of projects. I mean

1227
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The Rock has some duds.

1228
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Cena's been having

1229
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
fun recently. I feel like

1230
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
he's been fun in recently.

1231
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But even Batista I watched a video

1232
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
of him writing this for the first time.

1233
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And he was pretty thoughtful

1234
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
in his like analysis of

1235
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
it and did seem emotional

1236
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
like excited to be like I'm in Disney

1237
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
World now. Like I am a

1238
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
character in Disney World.

1239
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That's what you want people to appreciate

1240
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it. That's the main thing if they have

1241
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
if they've attained the ultimate goal

1242
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
for some on this Earth.

1243
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yes I want them to appreciate it. Yeah.

1244
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Know how crazy it is.

1245
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Well got to ride together. Of course

1246
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Mr. Marlowe got to ride with Aaron Paul

1247
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
of Bryan Cranston. That's right.

1248
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Which they

1249
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
seemed pretty excited to do. There was no video

1250
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
of that. There is no video of that.

1251
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't believe. But yes you can

1252
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
video this as much as you want

1253
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
apparently. I think well I think there's

1254
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
you can strap a GoPro to your chest

1255
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
or your head. Oh maybe.

1256
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Some of the videos I watched.

1257
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Just holding it would be too much. Yeah. Holding

1258
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
it I don't know if I would trust myself to hold

1259
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
onto it.

1260
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I caught video from a preview

1261
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
where halfway through

1262
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the ride stopped and all the lights

1263
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
came on so you could kind of see how big

1264
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the girders were

1265
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and how big the building is. The show building is massive.

1266
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's massive. Yeah.

1267
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah I've heard

1268
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
it's the size of the contemporary.

1269
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh my god.

1270
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That it has the volume to hold four

1271
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Spaceship Earths inside it.

1272
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah. And there

1273
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
is

1274
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
there's a moment when you arrive

1275
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
in that show build

1276
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
it's dark so you never get the

1277
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
fullest sense of it.

1278
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But kind of early on there's

1279
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
enough light that you could sort of see the scope

1280
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
of where you've just landed and that was a huge

1281
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
yell of oh my

1282
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
god to me. Realizing

1283
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
like oh we haven't even started.

1284
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We aren't even in the building yet.

1285
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And it's already we've already done backwards

1286
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
it's already all been very exciting.

1287
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We've got a great queue with a fun magic

1288
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
trick and hang on only

1289
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
now are we get it and we get to be in this

1290
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
room for you know what the

1291
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
two and a half minutes at least.

1292
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I also say about there is a lot

1293
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
of discourse online about the actual show

1294
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
building itself because you can see it.

1295
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's painted blue

1296
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
which let's not go away green obviously

1297
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
what's the name. Is there a name of that blue

1298
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
that's a blend in the sky. It's like a sky blue

1299
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that they try to make it. Blow away

1300
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
blend away. Blend

1301
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
away blue let's call it.

1302
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I will say this I didn't really bother

1303
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
me. There was some people saying oh it's too big

1304
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and like it's not hidden at all so like you

1305
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
can see it. But actually I really wasn't

1306
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
like annoying to me in any weird sight

1307
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
line way. Not that I care so much about that

1308
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
but I was thinking oh it's going to be

1309
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
so jarring. It was being discussed as if

1310
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
this is like a true blight

1311
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
on Epcot. And they they preserved

1312
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
the universe of energy building.

1313
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Well part of it yeah.

1314
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Is mostly the queue and

1315
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
the wonders of Xandar. The wonders of Xandar

1316
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
which is this

1317
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I think I mean we certainly

1318
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
made fun of the Chris Pratko and like

1319
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
oh I can't wait to get back to

1320
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Horizons

1321
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
or whatever that kind of. Veggie veggie

1322
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
fruit fruit. Yeah yeah.

1323
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes.

1324
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Which is this the first Disney world

1325
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
appearance of the idea of someone

1326
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
being sad. Their child

1327
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
their drives are gone.

1328
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Well here's okay.

1329
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
About this beat

1330
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
and we I didn't see it in

1331
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
person. We kind of I didn't realize it was a thing that you

1332
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
move you can move fast very quickly. It's the video in the queue

1333
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and I think we went by it too quick.

1334
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The queue is like an Epcot

1335
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
world showcase

1336
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
kind of pavilion about this

1337
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
other planet. Yes.

1338
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Just kind of clever. It is they refer to it

1339
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
as a other world showcase.

1340
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So you are getting a

1341
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it's like a little like

1342
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
it's you know much like the

1343
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
yeah you're going to Norway and you're going to

1344
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
learn some stuff about Norway but it's that for

1345
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Xandar across the galaxy.

1346
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And we can talk about some other

1347
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
stuff in there. But while we're talking about the

1348
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the scene starring the

1349
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
film separately players.

1350
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Right.

1351
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I mean

1352
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
yeah we didn't get to see it in person but rewatching

1353
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I think like that is a

1354
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
criticism that I have is that the

1355
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
if that's the joke that

1356
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
he can't wait to go do

1357
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
all the stuff that he did as a kid

1358
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
there's no payoff of that joke.

1359
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
There's no part where somebody's like oh

1360
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
somebody nudges him and like hey

1361
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
bad news Star Lord.

1362
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
There's no like the

1363
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
other person doesn't exactly like do a double

1364
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
take of like oh we got

1365
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
a little bit to talk about we'll be right back.

1366
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
There's no acknowledgement. If that's the

1367
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
joke it doesn't work. They don't telegraph

1368
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
that joke whatsoever.

1369
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's probably because

1370
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
they wanted to nod to stuff.

1371
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But then somebody looked at the copy

1372
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and was like we can't

1373
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
we can't admit

1374
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
that people might be sad coming to

1375
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Epcot. Yes.

1376
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah. And we can't acknowledge this thing

1377
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
that we've let these I

1378
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
feel like a lot of Epcot stuff got

1379
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
yanked out without kind of coldly

1380
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and without the realization

1381
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that people grew up with these things

1382
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and cherish these things. Right. And this

1383
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
is a fun way to acknowledge all that

1384
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
but they don't want to

1385
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
acknowledge the other side of it which is

1386
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
the sadness and

1387
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
the fact that they do

1388
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
want to keep trotting out figment

1389
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
for everything but improving the awful

1390
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
scourge of a ride that he is the

1391
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
star of currently. Yes. I think that's

1392
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
probably what happened

1393
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
where it was like I'm sure somebody was

1394
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
like oh yeah and then he'll say oh

1395
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but actually the rides aren't here

1396
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
anymore Star Lord. I have

1397
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
one note for this.

1398
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And this was we were dis Twitter

1399
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
canceled for this for making fun of this

1400
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
for daring to make fun of this scene

1401
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
where all of the actors are not

1402
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
looking at the same eye line

1403
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Chris Pratt keeps looking off at a second

1404
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
direction almost as if that is where the

1405
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
teleprompter is and you maybe

1406
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
kind of feel that Chris Pratt has I don't

1407
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
know never heard of

1408
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
any of the things he's mentioning until

1409
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the second that he's saying them.

1410
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I have one note here that would help

1411
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
you can't help all that

1412
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and none of it is that bad.

1413
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We're teased and it doesn't like drive

1414
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
everybody crazy or anything.

1415
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Could you get one more take

1416
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
where he doesn't say the Vigi

1417
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Vigi fruit fruit. That's the

1418
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
problem. I can't wait to see Horizons

1419
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and the and he really slows down

1420
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
it and the

1421
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
universe of energy dinosaurs.

1422
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
He could not he was not keeping those

1423
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
those words in the right

1424
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
order in his head. The dinosaur universe

1425
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
the energy of dinosaur universe

1426
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and then

1427
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and then he gets to and here

1428
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the Vigi Vigi fruit fruit. Who

1429
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
would ever say it that way with

1430
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
the that's the strangest grammar.

1431
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Nobody says like you're right but

1432
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I kind of like it. I can't wait to hear the

1433
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
it's a small world because it's kind

1434
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
of funny because like it's almost like what your

1435
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
grandma would say if you had been to F

1436
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
got 30 years prior and she's like

1437
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
what was that song the

1438
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Vigi Vigi fruit fruit song.

1439
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
That was a nice song.

1440
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You're right but I think you're giving grandma too

1441
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
much credit. Grandma would even remember

1442
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
that much. She'd go like remember the fruit

1443
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
concert. Well

1444
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
that's true. The also

1445
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
you know when it came out online it was in

1446
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
like full HD red camera

1447
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
whatever in the

1448
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
right it's like vertical screens

1449
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and it's got a million filters on

1450
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
it's a little maybe glitchy or

1451
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
hazy. Yeah the treatment's

1452
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
kind of interesting. I didn't

1453
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
even really we just went by

1454
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
it so fast.

1455
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I caught it as we were like leaving the room. I was like

1456
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
oh that's the thing. We just passed that part.

1457
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I did see the little

1458
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I didn't make the connection to

1459
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I kind of got with I got what they were going

1460
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
for in the line which is there's

1461
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
a little model of like

1462
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the Xandar capital

1463
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and they play clips of Walt

1464
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
doing the Epcot

1465
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
movie the Epcot TV

1466
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
presentation.

1467
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Are there Walt clips in the cube?

1468
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
There are Walt clips. Yeah trying to make the

1469
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
connection of like oh our home plan

1470
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
is much like this experimental city

1471
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
he wanted to build

1472
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and I'm like okay yeah that's kind of I kind of

1473
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
like that. The Easter egg I

1474
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
really like that I did not pick up

1475
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
on until I read about it

1476
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and then watch the clips.

1477
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The electric there's a moment

1478
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
where the Guardian

1479
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ship is going by

1480
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
the giant celestial

1481
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
who has taken

1482
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
the cosmic generator MacGuffin

1483
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
and the electric guitar

1484
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
song that's playing is an electric guitar

1485
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
cover of the original Universe

1486
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
of Energy song.

1487
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I saw that mention and then I was listening

1488
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
really hard for it and it is hard

1489
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
to parse.

1490
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's not like the most prominent. I didn't notice it when I

1491
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
was there. I didn't notice it when I

1492
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
was there but watching it enough

1493
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
times I could hear it.

1494
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Is it before the launch

1495
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
or is it? Yeah it's right before

1496
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
the launch the ship goes by

1497
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and he's like what is that noise?

1498
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Okay. And Star Lord says

1499
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
a line about like you can't

1500
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
yeah you can't destroy

1501
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
rock and roll. A little like guitar

1502
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
kind of a waly version

1503
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
of it. Yeah. Yeah.

1504
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I think this wonders of Zandar

1505
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
construct is pretty

1506
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
clever and it's a fun

1507
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
nod to Epcot history and a way to justify

1508
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
it being

1509
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
in Epcot.

1510
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
What I do

1511
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
find funny is

1512
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
okay so because there was

1513
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
when this got announced

1514
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
there was an energy

1515
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
the announcement of this ride that was like we're going to do a

1516
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Marvel ride and okay but but but but

1517
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
but but but but it's going to be acknowledge

1518
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
the history you see and it's

1519
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
going to be we're going to

1520
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
edutain as well and it's

1521
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
going to be kind of like an old Epcot pavilion

1522
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
you see and and Star Peter Quill

1523
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
he went to Epcot he was there

1524
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
he was there so this is going to be fine

1525
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
don't worry don't worry

1526
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
it all reminded me of like I was trying to come up with the right

1527
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
scenario of what it

1528
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
the tone of it felt like

1529
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
to me which is like imagine

1530
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that like there's a like a parent

1531
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
who's getting up there in age who has like a

1532
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
like their house that's their special

1533
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
house that they want to keep you know I just where I raise

1534
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
the family and I want to keep it in the family and

1535
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
you know in the autumn years

1536
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
the kids go to the parent and say like

1537
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
we will never the how we

1538
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
know we know the house is special

1539
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
to you it's important and we

1540
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
will never let it go because that's

1541
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
because the house is who you are

1542
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and we promise that we will and as soon as

1543
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
the death happens like alright flip it sell it for two million

1544
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
sell it to some company

1545
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
hey alright let's split that up alright we did it

1546
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
we ran the money

1547
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
boat money boat money

1548
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
but they have to do because

1549
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
we know we know Epcot

1550
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
important to you we know that it is

1551
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and we would that legacy

1552
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
we would that's why we edutain

1553
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
we don't just entertain we edutain

1554
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and Peter Quill was there

1555
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
he went as a boy your mother and I

1556
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
love each other very much but

1557
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but but

1558
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
this isn't your fault

1559
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and a universe of energy going is

1560
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
not because of you it's not because you

1561
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
put too much stress on this park okay

1562
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and don't ever think that

1563
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
you're describing

1564
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
that situation that I said

1565
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and then what you're describing is

1566
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
coddling somebody

1567
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
during a period of bad news

1568
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
or during a period

1569
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the other one was like if imagine

1570
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
that like they're going to take

1571
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
that right near Williamsburg Virginia

1572
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
they want to like build like a Ross

1573
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and a five below yeah and they have to go

1574
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
meet with the residents and do a dog and pony show

1575
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
for two years and go like and that's why

1576
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
we will honor the

1577
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
that we are going to call it founding

1578
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
father crossings

1579
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
so it's going to make us all the

1580
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
sense here in Williamsburg because we

1581
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
acknowledge the history

1582
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and we celebrate it and look there's

1583
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
going to be we're going to do it with like big

1584
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
columns there's columns there just like

1585
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Washington Monument had history

1586
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
so we celebrate history here at founding

1587
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
father crossings and then it's

1588
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
just this awful place of the

1589
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Costco and like Disney's

1590
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
America next to the Manassas

1591
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
battlefield full of bullets and

1592
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
bones it is exactly

1593
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
that it is them having to say

1594
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
like and we know people

1595
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
died on this ground and that's

1596
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
why we will honor them and

1597
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
we will

1598
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
put a grave satone for figment

1599
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
in this ride

1600
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
you can honor figment on your way

1601
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
into the roller coaster

1602
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
bring flowers for figment

1603
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
you can do that every day bring purple flowers

1604
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
to figments grave

1605
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
we will never stop that at the security

1606
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
line the figment

1607
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
uh uh uh Jane and I

1608
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
did ride Journey into imagination

1609
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and we when we were getting off

1610
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
we saw the figment photo

1611
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
spot and they're like oh

1612
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
well figment will be out in 20 minutes

1613
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and we looked around there's no one in line

1614
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
and I was like I guess the

1615
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
five hours wait dissipated

1616
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
pretty quickly that was a day one

1617
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and we're like we are running out

1618
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
we do not want to wait for 20

1619
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
minutes we are running out of time

1620
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
oddly proportioned to

1621
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
figment anyway I don't

1622
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I say all that to say like I don't know

1623
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that I think it's just funny

1624
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
that they had to do that

1625
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and that people bought it

1626
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
to some extent and then you get in and

1627
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
what it is is like it's kind of a fake Epcot

1628
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
pavilion

1629
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and there's this one scene where Chris Pratt

1630
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is saying words he doesn't understand

1631
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
okay we good we good with that

1632
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
and I don't know what

1633
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
side I take in this exactly

1634
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I guess I take the side that like

1635
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
isn't it better

1636
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
for everyone if there's a big ride

1637
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
in Epcot center that everybody's going

1638
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
to and doesn't that create

1639
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
more traffic that goes to the

1640
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
to the classics and to the old school ones

1641
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
like Spaceship Earth right living in the land

1642
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
like isn't that your better way to get

1643
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
new to get fresh

1644
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
blood in a different audience to

1645
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
the you know the old school

1646
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
vibe of Epcot that remains yeah

1647
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
well that's a that's the larger Epcot

1648
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
question that seems to be debated

1649
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
by I don't know I would

1650
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
assume it's a small percentage of theme

1651
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
park goers online

1652
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I think most people go there and they

1653
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
go what's a good ride to go on

1654
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it's this one okay who cares

1655
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
movie we liked okay

1656
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
yeah yes

1657
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
well hang on does this tie into a broader

1658
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
theme does this fit into the vision

1659
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
that Walt Disney had years ago

1660
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
having seen the movie I think

1661
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
the thing that kind of stuck

1662
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
with me

1663
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I haven't watched the third movie

1664
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
yet I heard there was some animal

1665
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
experimentation so I'm kind of building it up

1666
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm kind of bracing myself for that

1667
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
oh god

1668
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
high evolutionary it's too

1669
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
complicated to explain I understand

1670
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
kind of why it's in there but um

1671
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
the thing

1672
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
with

1673
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
guardians and especially the Peter

1674
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Quill character in general

1675
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
there's a lot about

1676
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
him being melancholy for Earth

1677
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
because he had this whole childhood

1678
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and then he was abducted you know

1679
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and his connection is

1680
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
all the pop music it's all the pop music

1681
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
it all starts with the death of his mother

1682
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
correct yes

1683
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and so

1684
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
he is a character that

1685
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
occasionally there's some sadness

1686
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
to and I guess that's all of the

1687
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
guardians characters are all kind of drawn

1688
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
together by their

1689
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
you know hard times in the past

1690
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and that got me thinking of like

1691
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
oh this is another

1692
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
thing that connects him to

1693
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Earth which he very

1694
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
rarely gets back and now I'm sad

1695
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
now he's got yeah he gets back

1696
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
to Earth and this is he gets

1697
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
what state is Epcot in oh my god

1698
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
it's so different

1699
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and it's not even teaching me anything

1700
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
about the motor vehicle

1701
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
industry yes I don't

1702
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
get to know what new vehicles general

1703
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
motors has for 1990

1704
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
my look I'll say this

1705
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
about it I think you're correct

1706
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
do I wish that they could

1707
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
have just kept up all the like

1708
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
all the different dark rides that were

1709
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
edutainment and horizon

1710
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
do I wish horizons was open of course

1711
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
do I wish they just plused up

1712
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
like world of motion and made it like

1713
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
cooler and kept it yes

1714
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I do and then added rides around

1715
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
let me on the record say I

1716
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
completely agree with you I think like

1717
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the Epcot problem is not

1718
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
doesn't start with guardians cosmic

1719
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
rewind the Epcot problem starts

1720
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
with taking out horizons in the

1721
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
old school and an original journey

1722
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
maybe primarily

1723
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
yeah that's that all feels like it

1724
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
was done in a real short sighted way

1725
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
yeah and that

1726
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
guts that completely guts the history

1727
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
of the park because again we want

1728
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
a mix of these places to be things you got to

1729
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
go on as a kid that have been plused up

1730
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and kept in good shape and then new

1731
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
cool crazy stuff

1732
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that's just like state of the art so

1733
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
that's kind of gone at Epcot other

1734
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
than spaceship Earth and I

1735
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
living with the land

1736
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
but that like that's that's sort of your

1737
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
two things

1738
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
there that like you went on if you were

1739
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
a kid in the 80s or 90s and look at the struggle

1740
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
though to that they wanted to

1741
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
do the plus up of spaceship Earth and then

1742
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
it's yes budgetarily

1743
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
and let me say this

1744
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I alright everybody get get your

1745
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
anger rising okay I know that we

1746
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I know that there's all this love

1747
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
for living with the land but don't you

1748
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
feel like it could

1749
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
be kept up a little of course

1750
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm looking at like literal like all Epcot

1751
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
big patches of dust in that

1752
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
thing like I was pointing out like

1753
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Epcot is tired of many even old brooms

1754
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
lying around which is why

1755
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I like when they seeing that they do

1756
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
a holiday overlay

1757
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm like that's something and again I think people

1758
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
are mad at me about living

1759
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
with the land but if you go back a lot of

1760
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
my argument is like what do we have here we've

1761
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
taken away the old song

1762
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that was good we've taken away the

1763
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
live uh tour

1764
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
guides and I think you just do

1765
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
some past that's like improving

1766
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
it aesthetically lighting is

1767
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
better I'm sorry about

1768
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
like corn kid and bean boy and all

1769
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
those people but maybe that could all be a little

1770
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
brighter like does it detract

1771
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
from the current living with the land

1772
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
to brighten it and

1773
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
freshen it by 10% yeah

1774
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I mean all the plants look great

1775
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
they certainly keep those up they better

1776
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
they're new they're as fresh

1777
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
as can be I thought the forest scenes

1778
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
looked really

1779
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
good this time I will say

1780
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I think I've underrated the

1781
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
beginning of the ride because I was on there

1782
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I was trying to like it more I was trying to see what everybody

1783
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
sees I like the beginning of the ride more

1784
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I was however explaining some things to

1785
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
living with the land newbie Griffin Newman

1786
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and he would say things like

1787
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
what's up with that window up there is that just

1788
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
like an office like why is that there

1789
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
said no that's a restaurant that overlooks

1790
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
the ride

1791
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and then I said well that used to be

1792
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
a revolving restaurant that has not revolved

1793
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
for many many years

1794
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
that doesn't sound good does

1795
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it there's all these things that are like

1796
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
oh that used to be that way that used to be

1797
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
that way here's a theory

1798
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
that the living with the land

1799
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
outrage people are clinging

1800
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
to living with the land so hard these

1801
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
days because there's not much left

1802
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
right yeah it's something

1803
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I can appreciate that I still appreciate that

1804
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
or world of motion we're still

1805
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
around you might be able to get away

1806
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
with your living with the land slander

1807
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
in a different in that world

1808
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
this is all we have how dare you

1809
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
come I'm not asking for the ride to be

1810
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
that's the vibe doubt I'm not asking for it to

1811
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
go away yeah I just

1812
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
like I think that like

1813
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I feel like that like a budget

1814
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that would go to like a

1815
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
a healthy like

1816
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
a haunted house display

1817
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
in somebody's front yard

1818
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I think that for ten thousand dollars

1819
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
that's a very expensive house I know

1820
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
but you know what I'm saying I think for not a lot of

1821
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
money I think everybody could like kick start

1822
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
the level of improvement that living with the land

1823
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
needs here's what I don't want this to

1824
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
spiral out of control here but I will

1825
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
say this unless we're going to do a full another living

1826
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
with the land episode my needs

1827
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
it's one of those keeps regenerating

1828
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I will say this

1829
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
yes I was checking for

1830
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
fast path or genie plus on

1831
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
the boat but I was for acknowledging

1832
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm sorry I doubted

1833
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
you it was very important though what I was doing

1834
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it was I was trying to optimize

1835
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the long getting set up

1836
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and it was a big pain in the ass to get it set

1837
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
up so I was trying to optimize

1838
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
but I'll say this the first part

1839
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
even though it's not sort of kept up

1840
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
it still is the

1841
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
vibe it still got

1842
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
the old school vibe

1843
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
dark ride wise who is

1844
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
somebody I apologize if this was maybe

1845
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
this was Kevin Tully somebody was saying

1846
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
that it feels like the it's like

1847
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
there's like a natural history museum vibe

1848
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
yes I which I totally

1849
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
like it would be better with the song

1850
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I agree but

1851
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
the smell the way it's all set up like

1852
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
you cannot ever recreate that

1853
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
so I was like

1854
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I like this when it gets to the

1855
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
lab part and the plants

1856
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
it's

1857
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
anticlimactic it's just like

1858
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
wow

1859
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
listener quote put a quote around

1860
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
that and give it to Mike Carlson

1861
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
take some heat away from me

1862
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
please it's burning up over here

1863
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I believe this though I believe that if the

1864
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
listeners think about this themselves

1865
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
they will find it in their heart they don't have to

1866
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
say it I will take the bullet for this

1867
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I will you don't have to admit it

1868
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
but deep in your hearts you know that the

1869
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
dark ride portion is the

1870
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
part worth saving is the good part

1871
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
the other part is fine it's just that

1872
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
it's what

1873
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
is this we're looking at plants and they

1874
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
say oh you can eat a burrito

1875
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
that has this bean in it like

1876
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
wow like I feel like I'm

1877
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
getting a full body massage right now

1878
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
what you were the weight you were taking off of

1879
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
my I'm just saying that the listeners know

1880
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I feel like you're taking a bullet for me Mike and I appreciate it

1881
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
well yeah you don't have to thank me

1882
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm just saying that if the listener

1883
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
they might have some affection

1884
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
for this part of it but obviously the magic is

1885
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
in the first half of the ride

1886
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
we gotta kick it right to Jason because you're the only audience

1887
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
surrogate here in this argument

1888
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I like that portion I think it's

1889
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
very relaxing I think

1890
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
it's fine theme parks is so stimulating

1891
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
having a nice boot

1892
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
ride you're getting what I

1893
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
find you know I am a

1894
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
full believer of like

1895
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
more greenery more water features

1896
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
it's good for the human brain

1897
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and

1898
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I think that I think

1899
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
the ending films and stuff

1900
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
that's the nostalgia

1901
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
that people are clinging to

1902
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm not talking about the films I'm talking about just being

1903
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
in the lab part where it's

1904
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
all the things growing in the greenhouse

1905
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
well we didn't have you know

1906
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
we didn't have time for the behind the scenes

1907
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
store seeds

1908
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I was back at the

1909
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
hotel and I found out they were selling

1910
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
plants little

1911
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
succulents or little

1912
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
seedlings from

1913
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
the ride you could buy at the exit

1914
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and I miss that cause I

1915
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
would have I'm a little plant

1916
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
boy I got plants on my balcony

1917
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I would have totally bought one of those back

1918
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I know airports are a little weird about

1919
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
bring it on a plane that sounds tough

1920
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
well I think domestically

1921
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
it's well yeah it's tough to pack

1922
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
but I know internationally

1923
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
they're very bunch of like oh don't bring

1924
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
that apple into Australia

1925
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
you know

1926
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
but if they said we're getting rid of the part

1927
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
where you're watching plants grow

1928
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and we're building more sort of

1929
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
dark ride that will show like

1930
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
different ways that

1931
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
people harvest crops there's different

1932
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
like future ways that we want to showcase

1933
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but it's going to be in the style of the old

1934
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
part first part of the ride

1935
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
would that not be better?

1936
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I don't know cause I feel like

1937
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
this is one of the few remaining

1938
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
pavilions that does fulfill the promise

1939
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
of like

1940
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
well the fish but

1941
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I shouldn't cut you off

1942
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I think the fish tank

1943
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
definitely the fish tanks

1944
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
you know while there are fish in them

1945
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
we did see someone working with the fish

1946
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
that's looking a little

1947
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
long in the tooth you know

1948
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
that's what I know

1949
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
those old sections cause they haven't kept it up

1950
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I think what I was going to say sorry

1951
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
is that like I think you're I see

1952
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
all this this all makes sense to me it's

1953
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
original Epcot that is about learning

1954
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I think there's a way to preserve that

1955
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
without it being

1956
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
so dry

1957
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
and maybe that finale could have

1958
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
more of a finale would definitely help

1959
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
more of a finale but I just like

1960
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
the climax of the ride is just going

1961
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
in an open air greenhouse

1962
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
in a lot of way like the last half of the ride

1963
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
is mostly just like going by

1964
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
oh like a strawberry that you're going to be able to

1965
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
eat in a tart later like with a sign

1966
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
like it's just not

1967
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
as engaging as the first part of the ride

1968
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
which is gives you the Epcot

1969
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
feeling that you're looking for you're looking for that

1970
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
dry

1971
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
old school dark ride

1972
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
which I chase on a lot we talked about

1973
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I think all of the old school

1974
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
short supply especially

1975
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
in Epcot I think we got

1976
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I'm telling you the solution

1977
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
is ten thousand dollars and it's not

1978
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
putting

1979
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
you know the marvels in it

1980
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it's not what I want it's not

1981
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
what I swear it's like

1982
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
better lights and then maybe at the end there's

1983
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
kind of some like flashing lights you go

1984
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
through I'm not a complicated man

1985
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and maybe it's cleaning up some of the dust

1986
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
in one of those black tunnels

1987
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
that's all I swear

1988
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
audience I'm not trying to take this ride away from you

1989
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
a little bit of set a little bit of

1990
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
theatricality I think you're asking for

1991
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
it's a little bit of like

1992
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
restoring it for the future and polishing

1993
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
it up to how it probably looked on October 1st

1994
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
1982 well yeah

1995
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I think too there's been so many

1996
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
advances in plant based

1997
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
cuisine and like

1998
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
that food court and that revolving

1999
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
restaurant it's still all very

2000
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
like literally meat and

2001
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
potatoes I'm gonna say this

2002
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
right now some of

2003
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
the some of the bad feelings that I

2004
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
get from the living with the

2005
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
land experience in general are from that

2006
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
bottom floor of the land

2007
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I completely agree with that too it's awful there it's so

2008
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
stressful you can feel the stress of everybody

2009
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
like trying to get on

2010
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
like Soren is it feels like an airport down there

2011
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
it's one of the most unpleasant parts

2012
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
that restaurant has awful signage awful

2013
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
fonts and when you look at old pictures of how

2014
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
that pavilion used to be with the

2015
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
balloons and it was just like

2016
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
beautifully designed beautiful

2017
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
colors restaurant used to be

2018
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
revolving now it truly that

2019
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
is an airport terminal in front that you get to

2020
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
stand in while you wait to get on that I agree

2021
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
yeah and I think I'm the only one who's

2022
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
watched the awesome planet movie

2023
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
yeah I have I

2024
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
could I think I could do a second

2025
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
gauge I have a lot of thoughts

2026
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
let's do awesome planet we're gonna do awesome

2027
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
planet I'd love to do awesome

2028
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
planet we're gonna do all hey I would look

2029
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
if we hey I'll cut you a deal

2030
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
we'll only do awesome planet if we hit symbiosis

2031
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
is that

2032
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
that's the previous that's the

2033
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
movie before the Lion King

2034
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
about pollution

2035
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
how we gone this long without doing all

2036
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
of these land movies

2037
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
question however the listeners not found us

2038
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and burnt us up with torches

2039
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
real quick I'll say the living with the land I guess

2040
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
around the holidays they decorate the

2041
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
greenhouse section

2042
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and that seems like I get

2043
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
it a little more better yes

2044
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
food and wine they were they had

2045
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
placards with like this

2046
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
is in this Mike has thrown

2047
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
that under the bus Mike has now

2048
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
vocalized that he doesn't do

2049
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
anything for you to know that this grape is

2050
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
used outside yeah it's just

2051
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
it's not it's just like

2052
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
at least you know what flip them around

2053
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
like let me go in that part first

2054
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and then let me go back in time and see the

2055
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
dark ride because that's obviously the more interesting

2056
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
part of the ride I think you Bill

2057
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I think there's some little finale I think Bean Boy's

2058
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
gotta go and there's just something that ties

2059
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
it all together that works

2060
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
for everyone that brings together the

2061
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
dry and the people who want a little I

2062
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
yeah I feel like the movie at the end

2063
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
could be updated you can keep those little

2064
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
heads in there that every month

2065
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
the projections

2066
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
just the screens I feel like

2067
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
you could update that

2068
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and still have those little guys pop

2069
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
up

2070
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
keep the guys but brighten them up

2071
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
more going on better technology we got

2072
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
better screens I will

2073
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I will share my thoughts

2074
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
on Awesome Planet

2075
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm afraid Awesome Planet Syndrome

2076
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
would affect

2077
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
oh yeah

2078
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
how about they add robots in

2079
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
like behind the fruits

2080
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
and stuff and the robots tell you

2081
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
like you know this tomato you

2082
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
can eat it later in the tomato

2083
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
soup at the pavilion by

2084
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I love that animatronics

2085
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
in the greenhouse would be awesome

2086
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
yeah yeah yeah it's just something there

2087
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
to make that part more exciting don't

2088
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
think that ruins it for anyone I don't

2089
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
we'll see I don't know if people are more

2090
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
we saw someone in the lab doing

2091
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
tests and people like I've heard people

2092
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
clap when they see

2093
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
someone in there working and it

2094
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
is nice to see someone doing

2095
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
that because there is work done

2096
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
in there I mean the seas

2097
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I think has the most

2098
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
like scientists

2099
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
actually doing stuff because you have

2100
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
to keep those animals alive

2101
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
yes that's true you know

2102
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
and healthy okay well if I could

2103
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
wind us

2104
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
if I could cosmic rewind us

2105
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
back to the

2106
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
to the ride in question today

2107
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
this ties in I think to the

2108
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Epcot

2109
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
educational thing

2110
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and something you mentioned earlier Jason

2111
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
they

2112
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
alright

2113
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
okay let me ask you both this

2114
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
have either of you watched

2115
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
the recent behind the attraction

2116
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
season 2 of Disney

2117
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
pluses behind the attraction

2118
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
and there's an episode about Epcot

2119
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and have either of you

2120
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
seen that no I haven't

2121
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
well first of all I know you've seen some of behind the attraction

2122
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
it's of course it's this great show

2123
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
where they get interviews

2124
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
with some of the greatest minds

2125
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and artists of the century

2126
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and they use editing to make it look

2127
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
like they are numbskulls

2128
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
well there's also sound effects

2129
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
there's also like a boy

2130
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
they do use sound effects as well yes

2131
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and so the imagineers hatched

2132
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
yet another brilliant scheme

2133
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
scratches nose

2134
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
yes no you're

2135
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
human beings do do

2136
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
regular stuff when they're on camera

2137
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
sometimes thanks for noticing behind the

2138
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
attraction people but anyway it's this

2139
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
big like

2140
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
you know they

2141
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
it is nice at least on it like it tells you how much

2142
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I want to see all this stuff I endure

2143
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
this show just to see the old footage of these

2144
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
things and there's good old Epcot footage

2145
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I pay tribute to some of the classic rides

2146
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
but then like the

2147
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
what they're

2148
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
in the like looking forward part where they

2149
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
that's essentially plugging cosmic

2150
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
rewind and this is more of that

2151
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
like maybe classic fan coddling

2152
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
they try to convince you that

2153
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
where this ride came from was

2154
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
we need to look

2155
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
the dinosaur ride is great

2156
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
right Ellen's energy adventure

2157
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
is great we all can't agree

2158
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
on that but it's maybe getting a little

2159
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
long in the tooth

2160
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
so is there a better way that we could tell a

2161
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
story about energy and we

2162
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
talked to a theoretical physicist

2163
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
who said you know what I think would be a good

2164
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
ride is a ride about the big bang

2165
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and how the big bang and yeah

2166
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
how would you use the power of storytelling

2167
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
to see how the big bang

2168
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
occurred and

2169
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and then ultimately led us to like you know

2170
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
what would be an interesting way to do it is with

2171
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
these characters with the guardians of the galaxy

2172
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
this is bullshit I call

2173
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
shit on every second of this there is

2174
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
no way this didn't start with

2175
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
let's do a guardians ride

2176
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
they're really trying to help you like let's

2177
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
pull you in step but no no no

2178
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
we wanted to do big bang we wanted

2179
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
to edutain about big bang

2180
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I admittedly did not

2181
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
know it was the big bang launching you

2182
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
backwards until I read the wikipedia

2183
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
no man

2184
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
you didn't know it when you were on it

2185
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
right I just

2186
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
figured it was one of many mcu

2187
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
explosions

2188
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
sure yes

2189
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
when you look back glenn close does

2190
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
talk about the big bang in her

2191
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
opening spiel so it's there

2192
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
but it is one of those things you gotta like

2193
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
go back and think about a little

2194
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
and that's fine I don't object to

2195
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
and they're right a big bang being

2196
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
launched backwards by the big bang

2197
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
great I just don't buy the

2198
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
story that like the foundation

2199
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
of this was a big bang

2200
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
yes Isan the celestial

2201
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
wants to destroy some stuff

2202
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
there's a shit here's what I'll say

2203
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
because I remember now reading

2204
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
that there was an idea for a big

2205
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
bang coaster now okay

2206
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
was it the TV show the big bang theory

2207
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I don't think I don't know that's maybe

2208
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
owned by different people but

2209
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
uh I

2210
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
it's possible there was an idea

2211
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
floating around for a big bang

2212
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
ride I guess I believe that

2213
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'll give them this because remember how it seems

2214
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
very convenient but this whole

2215
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
backstory where cars

2216
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
land came out of car land

2217
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
that there actually was a route

2218
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
sixty six themed area

2219
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
in progress and they just hadn't

2220
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
connected the dots and wait you should talk to Pixar cause

2221
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
they're making a movie and that all seems

2222
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
like such crazy coincidence I guess

2223
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
that is possible but

2224
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
the idea like you know what we thought

2225
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
was a good idea instead of it was a

2226
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
corporate mandate these characters

2227
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
need to be in the park immediately

2228
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
they're the only Marvel characters we can use

2229
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
we need to make some money on rocket plushes

2230
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
like that part where it's like

2231
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
this was purely a creative decision

2232
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
is obviously

2233
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
stretching it. What's a way we can tell that story

2234
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
oh hmm a roller coaster

2235
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I guess in Epcot I suppose

2236
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
well only if we make sure the audience

2237
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
knows that it's because

2238
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
we're only doing it because the story

2239
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
mandated that we do it. Yeah

2240
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
that part yes that feels like

2241
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Disney will not

2242
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
rewriting history I think the reality

2243
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
also being that

2244
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
oh Mission Breakout with its randomized

2245
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
songs was a big hit

2246
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
what if we did different randomized songs

2247
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
on this coaster in Florida?

2248
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You're right they're absolutely somewhere in there

2249
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
must have been like this quickie overlay

2250
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
that we did has been received unbelievably

2251
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
well so how quickly

2252
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
can we get something moving that's from

2253
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
the ground up

2254
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
that vibe and then feeling. And shocking to

2255
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
me that they didn't just

2256
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
re-theme the Tower of Terror

2257
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
in a lot of ways because of how

2258
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I'm glad I'm happy about it but I just

2259
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
success wise I'm sure

2260
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
they were even expecting

2261
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
more people to be upset after the fact

2262
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
they must have known that somehow

2263
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
that's a bridge you don't cross

2264
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that the studios

2265
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
one has to stay toilet-tied. I mean

2266
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
it makes more sense thematically for where

2267
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
it is just because that's a I think

2268
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
people like even though Rock and Roller Coaster is next to it

2269
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
it doesn't really

2270
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
but it does make much more sense. Hollywood

2271
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Old Hollywood, New Hollywood. I know what's Hollywood in

2272
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Hollywood Racker

2273
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
but no one cares about the Hollywood and

2274
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
California Adventure. Yeah. No one cares about

2275
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
that part of it. Oh yeah yeah yeah absolutely

2276
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I want them to turn that into

2277
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
anything they want as soon as they want to

2278
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
versus like it would be weird it would be weirder

2279
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
in Hollywood Studios. Yeah and then they

2280
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
did tie it in. I like that they reverse

2281
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
engineered it and then build Avengers Campus

2282
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and now you can go in that

2283
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
way. When it was odd definitely was

2284
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
alright it's a Hollywood Street and then into a

2285
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
corner there's one Marvel ride and then it's next to

2286
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Bugs Land

2287
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
that was all a little strange. Right.

2288
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I don't get too sorry to say

2289
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
bugged out by any of

2290
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
this and I also think like in terms

2291
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
of that Epcot coddling stuff

2292
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
that like

2293
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
it does feel like it belongs in Epcot

2294
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
like aesthetically like lead up building

2295
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
it does not feel like they just plopped a box

2296
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
that doesn't relate to anything into

2297
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
a park with a really specific vibe. Yeah.

2298
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I think they got it. They did a good job with the

2299
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
vibe and like

2300
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I think Epcot need a new E ticket.

2301
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I know Test Track is getting redone

2302
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
soon which is good because it's the last

2303
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
time I wrote it a couple years ago.

2304
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's feeling it's a little

2305
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
rough.

2306
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It's a little kind of feeling its age.

2307
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I think all the Tron stuff

2308
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
that they don't call Tron but

2309
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I think that

2310
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
glowing blue always

2311
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
looks good.

2312
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I hadn't done it till I

2313
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
went straight there on the Epcot day.

2314
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'd never done the Tron version.

2315
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I like it. I hear what you're saying.

2316
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
They probably got to like tweak

2317
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
the ride mechanism. Yeah there's some bumpiness

2318
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
but

2319
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
it's a bummer. I'm glad it's happening

2320
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
but obviously there's like 10 things on

2321
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
the Epcot list I would rather have than

2322
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Test Track getting redone. Yeah.

2323
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I will also say this like the vibe

2324
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
of Guardians just in the

2325
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
queue is right.

2326
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Like as soon as you walk in there you go

2327
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
yes I do feel

2328
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
this makes me feel a certain way.

2329
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And there's old Epcot

2330
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
mainly just

2331
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
it's new. It's really

2332
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
like polished and sleek

2333
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and clean and there's a lot

2334
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
of purple. It's all I ask.

2335
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I don't need a lot. To me like you know

2336
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
you can parse what the Epcot vibe is forever.

2337
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Ultimately there's a lot of that.

2338
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And like

2339
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
just like sleek futuristic

2340
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
purple makes me feel enough

2341
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
like I'm in Epcot 82.

2342
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It worked for me. And a substantial

2343
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
queue as well.

2344
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Enough like a lot of stuff in it.

2345
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Right when you get in that big

2346
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
planetarium they call it the

2347
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Galaxarium I think. Yeah.

2348
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Which has I think a half hour of new

2349
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
you know designs

2350
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and whatever planets

2351
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
and stuff to look at.

2352
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
The way they're running it you don't really get

2353
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
stopped in there for a long time.

2354
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You don't really get to stop and look at almost

2355
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
anything. You got all these like little like

2356
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
hologram projection kind

2357
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
of things like the solo ones like here's just

2358
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Terry Crews and I don't know what

2359
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
any of them say or what any of them are and

2360
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I may never. It's hard to. I apologize.

2361
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Yeah it's hard to catch them.

2362
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
The great Glenn

2363
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Close shows up in this ride

2364
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
right? Yes.

2365
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Yeah. Vin Diesel and

2366
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Bradley Cooper do not. Not voicing

2367
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
their characters. Or not voicing their characters.

2368
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Vin Diesel didn't do Mission Break

2369
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
either. He's been out for a while.

2370
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
He learned that he's like

2371
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
he asked the earth, how do they

2372
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
like me on the helicopter?

2373
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Is everybody saying I'm cool?

2374
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Yeah sure. Can I look

2375
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
at the message board? No no no wait wait Vin

2376
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
don't don't. That's it.

2377
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I'm never doing a ride again.

2378
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Never doing a ride again. They should have could have just

2379
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
sent him a blue yeti and

2380
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
a laptop and he could have done it

2381
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and that was. Well why did they need

2382
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
they could have just used the dialogue.

2383
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Oh right. Not like he has to record

2384
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
new dialogue.

2385
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
There's only one thing. They have enough

2386
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
emotions and inflections

2387
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
from the movie. Yeah so legally there must be

2388
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
a reason. Yeah he just didn't like negotiate

2389
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
it. And then yeah no Bradley Cooper

2390
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
which is very

2391
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
noticeable. That was all I could

2392
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
talk about as we were going through some of the pre-shows.

2393
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah I didn't care nearly as much as you.

2394
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Yeah well Griffin said. I didn't bring it up until

2395
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Griffin brought it up. I was like that was not Bradley Cooper

2396
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and I was like I agree. Yeah I know. Didn't sound

2397
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
like him. But he is in California

2398
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Adventure because California Adventure and the

2399
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
marketing there like we took two days

2400
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and filmed all this

2401
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
stuff on the set of Guardians 2.

2402
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Will this come up during the press

2403
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
of Maestro. Will somebody finally

2404
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
press him on. Where were you.

2405
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Why are you not on the why are you on the ride

2406
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
in California but not on the ride in Florida. I don't know.

2407
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I hope so. Yeah. I want to know.

2408
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Yeah yeah. Because he has to he had to

2409
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
get in the booth for it. I understand like. He was

2410
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
wearing the nose while when they

2411
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
needed him and the nose was going to

2412
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
mess up like it was going to like make

2413
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
him sound nasal. You don't want like

2414
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
all right here's the plan.

2415
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Anywhere. That would have been different.

2416
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yeah. Should he wore. He should have worn the

2417
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
snoot for when he played Rocket though too

2418
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I think. He should have worn Rocket's snoot.

2419
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Getting grief about not

2420
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
doing a ride and weird prosthetic

2421
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
choices. Like my man

2422
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
can't win. Yeah. Well

2423
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
to be fair I mean yes I would say it's not

2424
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
equal grief for those things. Not equal

2425
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
grief. No the nose is

2426
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
weirder. It's a weird choice.

2427
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Probably no one would have

2428
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
noticed if he just had his normal

2429
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
nose and they just did other makeup.

2430
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You know. I think that's right.

2431
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Yeah. So

2432
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
he's not. I do think

2433
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
there was I was looking at some like message

2434
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
boards and people like I think they're going to just replace

2435
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
it later. When they finally get him in the booth

2436
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
to do Rocket and they're going to replace it. This was a couple

2437
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
of years ago. Maybe a year ago.

2438
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Naive as could be. Somebody posted under

2439
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
it's not different a year later.

2440
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Oh.

2441
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Oh my god.

2442
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You find out there's no Santa Claus.

2443
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
They never change rides. Why would they

2444
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
ever just swap in

2445
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
like what why would they take

2446
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
a ride down to change audio

2447
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
tracks. I don't know they would have to take it down.

2448
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I mean you would just remaster the audio track

2449
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and put it in. Don't forget they

2450
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
did record

2451
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Vincent Price for Phantom

2452
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Manor and then go in and take it away.

2453
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Right. That is now it's come back.

2454
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Right.

2455
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But I that's a bizarre. Why do you do that?

2456
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Why do you have one of the last Vincent

2457
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Price performances and then throw it in the garbage.

2458
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
There's a lot of head scratching

2459
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
decisions over the years.

2460
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
We should talk about the songs.

2461
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Yes. Well I think you got a little

2462
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
more pre show. Oh yeah.

2463
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
We haven't really talked about. OK.

2464
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Wait. So all right. Here's the name Nova Prime

2465
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Irani Real.

2466
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yeah. There we go. There's our carry.

2467
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
That's from the movies.

2468
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Right. Yeah.

2469
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
But our original guy

2470
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
is Centurion

2471
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Talmeric. And I did

2472
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
the spiel at the beginning.

2473
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
People

2474
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
of Epcot. Epcotters.

2475
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Epcotians. Citizens

2476
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
of Epcot. This has a real like

2477
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
oh boy I don't think they realize what they were

2478
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
doing in terms of how this if this is going to

2479
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
play nonstop every

2480
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
day for 30 years.

2481
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
This is kind of odd. It's like fine.

2482
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
But

2483
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
again name check. Kevin

2484
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Tully from Telethon. He said

2485
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think before I went on it like I don't know what after

2486
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
he said like did you were people already

2487
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
doing Haunted Mansion Ghost Host for

2488
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
that. Were people like saying

2489
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
the Terry Crews lines along with and they

2490
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
were not. But I want listener

2491
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I wonder if you've experienced this. People are already

2492
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
throwing this

2493
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
this odd

2494
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
dialogue out. I don't know. It's

2495
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
fun. He's fine. I like him.

2496
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I like him too. It's nice to see him in an attraction.

2497
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I think he's funny. But I might

2498
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
date it

2499
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
in the way that Ellen's Energy

2500
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Adventure. A lot of that

2501
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
is very 90s comedy.

2502
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Sure. Between her and

2503
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Jamie Lee Curtis.

2504
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I think she's in the end. And Bill Nye.

2505
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
All of whom I

2506
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
like.

2507
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I mean I don't think that strongly

2508
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
about Ellen either direction but I love

2509
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Jamie Lee Curtis and I grew up loving

2510
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Bill Nye.

2511
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
If you like Ellen so much you should get a job

2512
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
working for her. Oh yeah.

2513
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Well I do know somebody who got a

2514
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
bicep. I mean the crew got

2515
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
beach cruisers one year.

2516
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That's nice.

2517
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You put up with it you get beach cruisers.

2518
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
What's the cost of a beach

2519
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
cruiser. But then

2520
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
you get acquainted with a couple things.

2521
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It would take two and a half million

2522
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
years to get to Xandar.

2523
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
So they're not going to get you to Xandar.

2524
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
The way you can jump

2525
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
around in space

2526
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
is with the cosmic generator.

2527
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And there are

2528
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
jump points. Artificial tunnels

2529
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that act as shortcuts linking

2530
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
distant points in space. And that is

2531
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
how people. If you have that

2532
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
you're able to get to Xandar and then back to

2533
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Earth very quickly.

2534
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So you know

2535
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
it's about science.

2536
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's about Big Bang. It's about cosmic

2537
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
generators and jump points. Jump points.

2538
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
We're teaching. A lot of

2539
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
kids grow up without ever learning about jump points.

2540
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
That's right. Yes.

2541
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Jump points. I guess that is

2542
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
from the movie. But yeah.

2543
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I guess you could have. A wormhole is

2544
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
kind of a concept that is a real concept

2545
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
whether it's been proven

2546
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
or not. I mean I like that

2547
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
there's an all new thing.

2548
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
It's just funny that they're like. It's still

2549
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
learning. It's still science.

2550
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And yes most of it is faking from Xandar.

2551
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Of course. It's there.

2552
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Look it's Saturday. It could work.

2553
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But you do get to use like a little jump

2554
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
point. And you jump up.

2555
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Terry Crews

2556
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
lets you know you're going to be teleported to a Nova

2557
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
ship that is hovering up above

2558
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Earth. So you get to

2559
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
right next to the Earth

2560
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
the space restaurant in Epcot

2561
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
which we didn't get to do. I know.

2562
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
There's too much. There's so much

2563
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
to do when you go back now. No episode

2564
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
about that. Not yet. But you get

2565
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
to do a little jump. And

2566
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
that leads to. So you're

2567
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
brought into this teleportation room

2568
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
that's kind of clinical

2569
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and a little bit like kind of a

2570
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
tight room and everybody crowds around the

2571
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
center. But then the cosmic generator

2572
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
is going nuts. And then

2573
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
is that what that is? I don't know. Or it's a separate

2574
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
ship. Sure why not.

2575
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Anyway lights go out.

2576
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Power goes down. It's

2577
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
black for a couple seconds. And then you look

2578
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
around and you're in a whole other room.

2579
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
This rules. It's great.

2580
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's really good. I didn't know there was this.

2581
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I didn't either. I stayed away from

2582
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
most of the videos. I saw little clips. But yeah

2583
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I stayed away from this. So this was a shock to me.

2584
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah. This is now I don't know if they do

2585
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
it in the same way. But we've spoken

2586
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
about how apparently the

2587
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
effect in the Star Trek experience

2588
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
at the Vegas Hilton was very

2589
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
impressive. And that there was a lot of like how

2590
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
did they do that. And I wonder if it's the same

2591
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
thing. Which in this case is

2592
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
spoiler is ceiling

2593
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
going up into the rafters

2594
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
rather than the walls going up.

2595
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah. Should I say ceiling? Yeah. Yeah.

2596
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Sorry. Yeah. Like it shoots up.

2597
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Yeah. I don't know about that Star Trek

2598
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
illusion that everybody talks about being so cool.

2599
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
But yeah this was very

2600
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
effective. I first I didn't think

2601
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
oh the walls must be in the ceiling or

2602
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
anything. Like it's just such a good

2603
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
illusion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2604
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
They did it but it's great. And that

2605
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
spaceship is quite grand

2606
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and a big like space. Disney's real

2607
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
good at this right now. Again haven't

2608
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
been to the space restaurant so I haven't seen that.

2609
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
But that's a big old space

2610
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
screen. A lot of good space screens. Yeah.

2611
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Rise of the Resistance.

2612
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
It seems like one of the better elements probably

2613
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
of the dearly departed

2614
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Galactic Star Cruiser. Yes.

2615
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Love the space screens. Keep

2616
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
it up everybody. Yes. Great space screens.

2617
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Space screen. The

2618
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
screens on Mission

2619
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Breakout too I find very

2620
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
good where you look and you see the guardians

2621
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
in the collection. Yeah.

2622
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
In that giant facility.

2623
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
That still looks good yeah.

2624
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Still looks really good six years later.

2625
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And Bean Boy deserves that level

2626
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
of screen. This is what I let's get

2627
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Bean Boy. 18K.

2628
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Whatever the sphere is in.

2629
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Yeah. Yes.

2630
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
We know the technology

2631
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
is this. Let's get Bean Boy

2632
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
in Sphere. Let's get them on the

2633
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Sphere. Sure. Let's get Bean Boy in Tomato

2634
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Girl. Absolutely. I got nothing against them.

2635
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
All these great

2636
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
the veggie veggie fruit

2637
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
fruit boys and girls. Let's get them wherever they

2638
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
deserve to be.

2639
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And also it's you know

2640
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
it's a good thing that this teleportation works

2641
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
so well because it's you know our

2642
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
he's not sure he's never transported

2643
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Earthlings before but our molecular

2644
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
structure is very similar to Zandarian

2645
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
so it's not a big challenge.

2646
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So lucky that works out. That's nice.

2647
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
But then how

2648
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
quickly does something going wrong?

2649
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
When do guardians

2650
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
show up because something went wrong or

2651
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
do they just show up to say hey?

2652
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I think they because something goes wrong. That's the

2653
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
the chronology.

2654
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And now we're having power struggles

2655
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
on the ship and nobody knows

2656
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and there's also

2657
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
some effects in play with the

2658
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
cosmic generator because that's in some

2659
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
tube that's next to where

2660
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
the guardians all show up.

2661
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And it's there

2662
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
but then it's not there and they wonder what

2663
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
happened to it and there's a kind of funny line about

2664
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
like what happened

2665
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
to it. I don't know maybe it's that big guy outside

2666
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
the ship and then a very

2667
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
like okay Marvel

2668
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
people. Ison this is new. There's no

2669
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Ison anywhere else.

2670
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Wait no Ison is a celestial.

2671
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
He's a celestial. In other media?

2672
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Yes. Yes. Okay. In a

2673
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
movie or in where do you see

2674
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Is he in the

2675
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Eternals? I haven't seen

2676
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
the Eternals yet. I'm behind on a lot

2677
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
of my Marvel stuff. Yeah.

2678
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I saw the first half hour of the

2679
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Eternals before the hardest sleep I've

2680
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
ever had in my life. Yes.

2681
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
The Celestials are ones

2682
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
where it's like they're crazy

2683
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
giant god

2684
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
godlike creatures

2685
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
very

2686
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
cool. They feel like people crossed with

2687
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
suns. They're big sun beings.

2688
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Yeah very cool Jack Kirby designs

2689
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
in the comics that in the movies.

2690
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
These are the Celestials from

2691
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
very pop party in the comics. In the movies

2692
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
they're fine. I like these

2693
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
sun and the ride. I like the designs of

2694
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Jack Kirby more than maybe the live

2695
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
action Celestials.

2696
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Ragnarok had the most Kirby

2697
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
design

2698
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
There's some good Kirby background

2699
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
especially background stuff. And there's a

2700
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Celestial masks in

2701
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Mission Breakout. Mission Breakout

2702
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
those look pretty good. Those look cool

2703
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
yeah. As a

2704
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
not a Marvel fan

2705
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
some of the disconnect I've had

2706
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
is like I saw First

2707
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Avengers enjoyed it fine but I didn't

2708
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
necessarily think I would like 30

2709
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
more movies in this aesthetic

2710
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
unchanging in any way.

2711
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Well that's a yeah I think the

2712
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
fun as I've said many times probably the fun

2713
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
of the comics to me is always or

2714
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
any doing anything that's been around for

2715
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
decades the fun of it is

2716
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
having somebody with an interesting point of view

2717
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
doing their take on it.

2718
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
So you know you would get

2719
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
then you end up after decades and decades of

2720
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
like oh there's like 10 cool

2721
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
X-Men runs with different art and

2722
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
different vibe and a different voice

2723
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
different style. Same with Batman.

2724
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
There's so many different versions of Batman. So the

2725
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
thing with the Marvel movies is they've tried so

2726
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
hard to make them all feel the same

2727
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
which after so many of them

2728
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
it's like let them do a different

2729
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
thing like. Yeah really.

2730
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I don't like that. Are any of them am I

2731
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
wrong if I missed one that's like actually this one

2732
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
really stands out. Well I think that's why the Guardians

2733
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
movies stood out because it was

2734
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
kind of I don't want to say blank

2735
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
slate characters because there were certainly

2736
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
interesting material to draw on

2737
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
but in terms of the movie you had one guy

2738
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
with a specific voice.

2739
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Applying it to these interesting

2740
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
performers. You feel a little

2741
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
more James Gunn in those than you do I think

2742
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
on some of the other movies but I

2743
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
do think they still all have like this

2744
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I don't know if there's actually a sheet that says there's

2745
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
a mandate but it all feels like well there has to be

2746
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
seven action sequences in these things

2747
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
or every eight minutes there has to be

2748
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
an action sequence and you're like that's

2749
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
fine sometimes but like

2750
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
some of these characters you could just

2751
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
have it be a little talky and then there's like a

2752
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
big ending or something. It just feels like

2753
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
there's still there's a very specific

2754
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
roadmap that everybody has to follow

2755
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
when making these things and

2756
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
the TV shows have tried to deviate

2757
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
to some degree from them. Oh yeah One of Vision

2758
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
seems different. And that was different yeah

2759
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
so like maybe they have a little more leeway there but

2760
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
it's like I think

2761
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
they're trying to like

2762
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
keep everything feeling the same which I think is also

2763
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
kind of an overthink because like well

2764
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
how will viewers

2765
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
accept like

2766
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
the Christian Bale Batman in

2767
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
a movie with a different

2768
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
tone or like with

2769
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
the Ezra Miller Flash like

2770
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
that's just such different universes and it's like

2771
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I think the reality is the audience doesn't care if the movie is cool.

2772
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah no one cares. It would be great I love it.

2773
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Somebody from one universe showing up in a

2774
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
totally different one sounds awesome.

2775
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Yeah. That's the problem is that when Clooney

2776
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
spoiler when Clooney Batman

2777
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
shows up you're like that's not him

2778
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
that's George Clooney. That has

2779
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
nothing to do with Joel that is not a bunch of

2780
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
that's not Joel Schumacher

2781
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
in this boring 2023

2782
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
movie. So it is like I wish the movies

2783
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I wish people that were making the movies really

2784
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
got to do what

2785
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
they wanted. It's like running Edgar

2786
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
right off of Ant-Man

2787
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
to me is a very proof

2788
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
that like they have a different agenda

2789
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
than like making sure everything

2790
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
like has its own unique voice and

2791
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
is cool and like they would

2792
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
like you could pick any cool

2793
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
like filmmaker that like really has

2794
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
a specific voice and I feel like

2795
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
at the end of the day like Marvel

2796
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Studios would be like no we're good.

2797
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
We don't need you to make a unique

2798
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
movie for us.

2799
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
We're more interested in making something that feels like the other

2800
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
movies. Yeah.

2801
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I think the ones like

2802
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Guardians or Winter Soldier

2803
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
or Ragnarok the stuff that

2804
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
sticks with people is a little

2805
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
more personality or a little

2806
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
more character from the directors.

2807
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yes. Yeah.

2808
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Endgame and

2809
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Infinity War I

2810
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
think stuck out because you got

2811
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
like that one it was just

2812
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
everyone. Well that's

2813
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
that's Sesame Street

2814
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
meets the Muppets.

2815
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It's scale. Yeah.

2816
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
So it's like you throw enough

2817
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Sesame Street characters meet the Muppet characters

2818
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
at me and it's done in like

2819
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
an interesting way. I'm like I'm going to be entertained.

2820
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I'm going to enjoy it. Yeah.

2821
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
If you know if the characters are doing it.

2822
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
So yeah those are and I assume when Secret

2823
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Wars comes out in a couple of years

2824
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and you just have like Jackman and Tobey Maguire

2825
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
hanging out. I wish

2826
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I assume that's what the movie will be.

2827
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
My brain is really that's cool.

2828
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I like watching those

2829
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
characters like I like that. So

2830
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
yes. But you will never get your dream of Han Solo

2831
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
hanging out with

2832
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Watto or Dexter Jetser.

2833
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Yeah no I won't. Unfortunately.

2834
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
But what you were saying

2835
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
are like Fantastic Four and X-Men

2836
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
do have

2837
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
like their own self-contained

2838
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
universes their own

2839
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Rose Gallery. Yeah.

2840
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And that is like if you want to

2841
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
juice these movies a little

2842
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
it's like well bring in all this.

2843
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
You know. Right. Which is like

2844
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
whatever they're trying.

2845
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yeah. Yeah. Who got cast

2846
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
as Mr. Fantas...

2847
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Pedro Pascal is the word

2848
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
right now I believe. That's a rumor.

2849
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I like him. Sure

2850
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
yeah. I mean I like

2851
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
everybody. Yeah.

2852
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I love everything.

2853
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I love everybody.

2854
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
So it's just

2855
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I would love it if

2856
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
they could just

2857
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
really make the movies very different feeling.

2858
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah. That would be

2859
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
cool. But yeah.

2860
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
But here you know like

2861
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
so let's see

2862
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
we're on evacuation

2863
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
shuttles is what the right

2864
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
vehicle is sold as. Now we're on

2865
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
like a ship that's losing power.

2866
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So there's red lights. There's

2867
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
a panic air. You move from

2868
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
teleportation room or from the ship

2869
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
rather post teleportation room to the

2870
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
like evacuation area

2871
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
slash coaster loading zone

2872
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
really quickly. That's nice. It's a fun

2873
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
you pass by a window and go oh there we go

2874
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
that room looks good. I'm excited to be in there.

2875
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
There's a real

2876
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
like space mountain times five

2877
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
kind of like when we're descending down

2878
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
into the load zone.

2879
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Coaster vehicles look cool. The ride

2880
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
vehicles themselves besides that they spin and everything.

2881
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So cool. Really sharp. A little

2882
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
like battle worn and just the right amount.

2883
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Good color scheme.

2884
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Love it. I want to go on it right

2885
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
now. Yeah. Describing it

2886
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
like I feel I'm wistful.

2887
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I feel wistful. The Zandarian

2888
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
ship in front of the building.

2889
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I like a lot too. Oh yeah. I like that choice

2890
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
with a plaque from

2891
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Nova Prime. Like that's clever.

2892
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I didn't see the plaque. That's cool. Okay.

2893
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Yeah

2894
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
and then you're

2895
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
you load up. You go up that

2896
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
lift hill is fantastic. I don't know how to describe

2897
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
what the lift hill is but just with those kind

2898
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
of like curved brackets

2899
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
and then screens that are rapid fire

2900
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
cycling through. That's an exciting buildup.

2901
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It's pretty good seeing like

2902
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
big screens with the guardians.

2903
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
My friends from the other

2904
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
ride and no other media.

2905
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
It's like Rex.

2906
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I was trying

2907
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
to do the math of

2908
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
when you

2909
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
are you in the other

2910
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
building past that

2911
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
lift hill or is that

2912
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
at the launch and I believe it is the

2913
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
launch. I think that you're not in building

2914
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
to until

2915
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
the launch. I believe that's right.

2916
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Which that's when you look at it from

2917
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
afar and you see this kind of this weird little tunnel

2918
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
that connects to you. Yeah. It's kind of

2919
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
exciting to see the architecture from outside

2920
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and like oh wow yeah that's just that's purely a

2921
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
launch tunnel there. Yeah. Look how much

2922
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
we haven't even gotten over here yet.

2923
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
That room

2924
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
you go through kind of like

2925
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
a jump point tunnel.

2926
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Cool lights there.

2927
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
It all feels more

2928
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
to the argument of like

2929
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
a lot of Marvel things have similar aesthetics.

2930
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I do get I fuzz out on

2931
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
like this explosion versus

2932
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
this explosion versus this sky

2933
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
beam versus I

2934
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
think that jump point tunnel is

2935
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
cool. I'm seeing how like

2936
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
the guardians aesthetic is a little more specific

2937
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
and a little more defined a little more colorful.

2938
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Yeah. Very colorful for sure.

2939
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Then this really

2940
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
cool room where you do like a big

2941
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
horseshoe and that's kind of

2942
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
the first it's the room that serves

2943
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
to flip you around.

2944
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Where you stay focused on

2945
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Ison and the guardians ship

2946
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
and it's

2947
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
it doesn't look as good it really doesn't

2948
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
read and ride videos. Yeah it doesn't.

2949
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Because cameras phones and stuff can't like

2950
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
adjust the exposure correctly

2951
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
so you can just you can see the screens you can see

2952
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
the ceiling you can see the track in the room

2953
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
it's immaculate in there.

2954
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
It's so cool and you may not even realize

2955
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
that's what the track is doing and you don't

2956
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
maybe don't even catch that you're looping around

2957
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
at that moment.

2958
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
But then you get some really great

2959
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
guardians cheese which is

2960
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
the line no one

2961
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
can stop rock and roll from existing.

2962
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Yeah. And that's

2963
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
the universe of energy.

2964
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
That's right. Down in hell.

2965
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Which on the ride

2966
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I just thought that was like

2967
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
that just read to me as

2968
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
copyright free

2969
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
It's like Bohemian Rhapsody. Rock and roll music.

2970
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Yeah yeah. And before

2971
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
that I believe it's the guardians

2972
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
theme. Is that

2973
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
correct Mike? I believe so.

2974
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I always get the guardians theme and the Avengers theme

2975
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
confused. They're pretty close.

2976
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Do you think there was ever a time

2977
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
when they had it in the copy that it was just going to say

2978
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
rock and roll will never die?

2979
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Because I mean I understand why

2980
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
they're saying existing because you're going back in the past

2981
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
and you could like. Yeah no death

2982
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
is the end. That's the opposite. Death is the

2983
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
end. This is like never

2984
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
never die. It's such a cooler

2985
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
thing to say. Well universe

2986
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
applicable to the entertainment. Universal

2987
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
has the monopoly on the phrase death

2988
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
is only the beginning which has

2989
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
shown up in an

2990
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
unusually large number of attractions

2991
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
over there. Which theme park has the

2992
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
rights to Neil Young's hey hey

2993
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
my my rock and roll

2994
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
can never die or will never die. He's very

2995
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
anti-corporate but he gives it out to theme parks

2996
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
no problem. Yeah. He was trying to get

2997
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
a song on this and they were they didn't take it.

2998
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
What about Neil Young's rock and roller coaster?

2999
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
How about that? I'd like that.

3000
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Oh it's shop Joe sells ponos.

3001
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Overstock ponos. Oh yeah it's ponos. It's mostly

3002
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
is five hundred dollar. Yeah yeah.

3003
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Uncompressed music

3004
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
software. But we don't

3005
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
have Neil Young.

3006
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
What we do have is a great

3007
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
bevy of other

3008
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
song selections. Rock and roll. No one's

3009
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
going to stop rock and roll from existing. Then something

3010
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
then there's a little like everything like

3011
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
all this momentum is building and then it all sucks

3012
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
down to nothing. And the kind of

3013
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I really like that moment of

3014
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I think we went back.

3015
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Zoe Saldana line. Yeah.

3016
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yeah and then it's silent for a

3017
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
second. There's an odd an eerily

3018
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
still moment before

3019
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
incredible launch

3020
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
sequence. It's a similar moment

3021
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
to Star Tours when you shoot that

3022
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I forget which

3023
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
scene it is. It's the one with Boba Fett

3024
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
in his ship. Oh yeah. And you shoot

3025
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
like a thing at the or Boba Fett shoots it at you

3026
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
and there's like a brief like kind of moment

3027
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
of silence. And then this like

3028
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
massive explosion happened

3029
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
in space with like and you like shake

3030
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and it's that cool. You get a little

3031
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
moment. It's probably a second.

3032
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
A little moment of silence but that doesn't have

3033
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
like a blondie song playing

3034
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
suddenly. Well I hear you.

3035
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Yeah it's true because what a great to like

3036
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
let it all die down so that

3037
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
some music can blast

3038
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
at you. I guess right

3039
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
before the music that launch itself

3040
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
is incredibly exciting. I look so

3041
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
terrified on the

3042
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
it's a really embarrassing ride photo and

3043
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I as was

3044
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Tron and I get I think

3045
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
it's I think it's the unfamiliarity. I think my

3046
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
first time on anything. I

3047
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
just really and I don't even feel

3048
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
the panic but I look back and like

3049
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
that's bad. That's really but it is

3050
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
the launch is something. That's

3051
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
that's it's intense. It's not near

3052
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Rock and Roller Coaster but it's a hell of a launch

3053
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and I hadn't done a backwards launch before.

3054
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
It's yeah it's really cool. It's not

3055
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
unpleasant. It didn't make me sick. It didn't make me

3056
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
too scared after the fact. But

3057
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
it's it's intense and it's a cool

3058
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
tunnel you go through. It's a great moment. Do you

3059
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
think you would be more like

3060
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
on Rip Ride Rocket which is the vertical

3061
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
like because because again I would say like

3062
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
the launch is the ripping the bandaid off for me

3063
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
at this point still with any coaster.

3064
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
It's like I am not bothered by the launch.

3065
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
It just it rattles my brain

3066
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
immediately and we're ready to go. I'm so much less so.

3067
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It's one of those you feel the time

3068
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
passage how long we've been doing that honestly

3069
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
the no launch queen feels really

3070
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
far in the rear view. Yes. And I'm not just

3071
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
saying that because I'm trying to shake that phrase off.

3072
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Sure. It just genuinely isn't something

3073
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I it's something that I love that

3074
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
like due to doing this podcast

3075
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
it's like everyone you guys

3076
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
listeners Matt Rogers

3077
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
everyone helped me together to

3078
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
get over this thing. And now I get to go on rides

3079
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
like this and I'm not like because you were in the line

3080
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
with me. I wasn't like no you're just

3081
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
shaking trembling and I was really excited to do this ride.

3082
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I had zero nerves

3083
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
whatsoever. That's good. More intense

3084
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
coasters possibly and I will I forget

3085
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
if I've said I did not do Velocicoaster

3086
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
so that is still there's still

3087
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
some hills I have to climb.

3088
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I sat out

3089
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Hulk this time. We did Hulk

3090
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
last time. Oh I did Hulk.

3091
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
And that's a very intense launch and you

3092
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
immediately twist

3093
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
at the top of that hill.

3094
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And Hulk will just your brain will rattle

3095
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
around in your skull on the Hulk.

3096
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
But you were asking about Rip Ride Rocket.

3097
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Yeah I'm just saying that I still

3098
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
to this day I'm very anxious especially on

3099
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
like a completely vertical

3100
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
slow climb.

3101
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
But I yes it's it's anticipation

3102
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
still for me that I get

3103
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
anxious. Well look and I don't you know

3104
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I still not very versed in Magic Mountain

3105
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
or other Six Flags or more coaster based parts.

3106
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I think it would I'm so like based in

3107
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
the Disney Universal ones that I think I would constantly

3108
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
be like we're not done with

3109
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
this hill yet. There's no soundtrack.

3110
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
There's no on board audio.

3111
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
What is this? What is this?

3112
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I'm in coach. I only fly first class.

3113
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Yeah.

3114
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'd be a snob

3115
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I think. It's also a

3116
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
mix of emotions when you're like

3117
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I was just loaded by a 16

3118
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
year old. My valuables

3119
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
are in like an Ikea

3120
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
bookshelf. I

3121
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
am trusting no one to steal

3122
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
them.

3123
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
But anyway

3124
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
great launch. Love the

3125
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
launch. Photos be damned.

3126
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Music. Sorry to cut you off

3127
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
when you touch another music before.

3128
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Oh my god. I'm going to

3129
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
make this declaration. I think

3130
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
that just the list of songs

3131
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
the musical selection here I think

3132
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
all told is a better crop of songs.

3133
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Okay. Then

3134
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Mission Breakout. It's at least for

3135
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
me more songs that I

3136
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
specifically like and listen to regardless

3137
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
of being on a ride. I think it's a really

3138
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
kick ass crop.

3139
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I yeah I think

3140
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I think I agree with that.

3141
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Okay. Yeah. Not so controversial.

3142
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Let's talk about what we actually had.

3143
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Konga.

3144
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
We got Konga.

3145
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I was so excited about

3146
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Konga. Okay. First of all launch hitting me. Oh my

3147
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
god. So I'm screaming at launch. Then

3148
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
that it is Konga.

3149
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Is Konga my favorite

3150
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
song to listen to on the

3151
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
list of six. No.

3152
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Do I go out of my way

3153
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
to listen to Konga. Not necessarily.

3154
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
But for some reason it is really

3155
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
what I wanted on this.

3156
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
It really delighted me that you

3157
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
would hear this 80s Gloria Estefan

3158
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
song

3159
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
as the score of a roller coaster. That just seemed

3160
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
like the most fun

3161
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
to me. And apologies to Jane.

3162
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Jane on the way. Jane said I just

3163
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
hope it isn't Konga.

3164
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I was like what. And she had

3165
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
her reasons. I'm like okay. But then

3166
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
it made me like

3167
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
her spirit is going to make

3168
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
it so we don't get Konga. No.

3169
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And then we got Konga. And I was like

3170
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
yeah.

3171
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I think. I don't think she

3172
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
feels. I think she

3173
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
just thinks Konga is a little

3174
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
overplayed. That's definitely

3175
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
true. Yeah. But.

3176
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I associate it with a lot of

3177
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
early 90s, late 80s,

3178
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Disney parades and specials.

3179
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Totally. Sebastian the crab kind of stuff.

3180
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
It has Disney.

3181
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
We're dancing at the newly

3182
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
opened Caribbean beach resort

3183
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
or whatever.

3184
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Kid friendly pop hit.

3185
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
When they didn't make music specifically

3186
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
for kids and teens.

3187
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
They just had to make do with like

3188
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
the most clean songs that adults liked.

3189
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And Gloria Estefan

3190
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
and Emilio Estefan.

3191
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Kind of a long history with

3192
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
the resort I feel with that stuff.

3193
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
With appearances in the specials.

3194
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
There was of course the

3195
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
bongos cafe at downtown

3196
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Disney. For a while.

3197
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
For a long time. Yes.

3198
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Of course the greatest moment in Disney world

3199
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
history. Mike's performance with his mother.

3200
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Which song was that?

3201
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
That was a one two three. Yeah.

3202
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Come on baby say you love me.

3203
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So that's a historic

3204
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
moment. Yeah. Great concert

3205
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
performance. And then she also

3206
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
made a little video of her

3207
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
and her family. They shot a video of her

3208
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
and her family going on this ride.

3209
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
And really funny seeing her say

3210
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
alright today we're going to Xandar.

3211
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
In the crossover of now

3212
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Gloria Estefan being aware of

3213
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
this Marvel mythology.

3214
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
And unfortunately they got Tisco

3215
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
and Furnos. So

3216
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Sorry there's no way to even we can't custom

3217
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
do it. Sorry Gloria.

3218
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
So anyway

3219
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
that it was just

3220
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
it was the one I wanted for whatever

3221
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
reason. And then it gets you into this

3222
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
area where the ride it's a

3223
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
roller coaster that is also

3224
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
kind of concert. Because

3225
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
it is so loud. Yeah.

3226
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
And so disorienting and

3227
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
fun and such a party.

3228
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And I'm like

3229
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
like pumping

3230
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
my arms the whole time. I was watching

3231
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
the kid next to me to make sure I didn't hit him.

3232
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Like let me bend over this way just so I

3233
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
can prop because my impulse was definitely

3234
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
to like just pump those arms

3235
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
the whole time. It was so fun. Yeah.

3236
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I was laughing a lot on this

3237
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
and velocity. I was just so

3238
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
delighted by all the little

3239
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
tricks and turns

3240
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
and all sorts of

3241
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
things. Yes. It feels like yes.

3242
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I've never yes you've never been Handel like this

3243
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
before. And the delight

3244
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
you can't help but express it. Yeah.

3245
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I'm being Handel.

3246
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I love how I'm being Handel.

3247
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
All the list of songs

3248
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
September by Earth Wind and Fire

3249
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Disc of Inferno by The Tramps

3250
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Everybody Wants to World the World

3251
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000

Sound Machine. So yeah.

3256
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I wanted Tears for Fears.

3257
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Sure. Because

3258
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I was like that is an interesting vibe

3259
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
for a coaster.

3260
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
There's not a lot of music on roller coasters

3261
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
that are songs that like give me

3262
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
feelings. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

3263
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It's moody. It's like I put that on

3264
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
as kind of when I like want to feel

3265
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
you know. So that's that is crazy.

3266
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
That's crazy. And that's especially in the last couple

3267
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
years I've listened to that song and I go this is like

3268
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
one of the best constructed songs

3269
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
ever. Like it's because like that

3270
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
almost was just on so much when I was a kid that I

3271
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
didn't even think twice about it. I didn't care

3272
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
when it was like if it would pop up on VH1

3273
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I didn't give it the time of day did it. Yeah.

3274
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
It's one of those where you need like a little time. You need to discover

3275
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
it on your own. And you go

3276
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
oh god this is a great vibe.

3277
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
It over heels both. Yeah.

3278
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
The vibes with those songs too.

3279
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And you're like if you really listen to it.

3280
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
So when I heard that that was one of the choices

3281
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I go oh god.

3282
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Like I imagine I'm fantasizing

3283
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
about like being at Epcot

3284
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
like at closing alone on

3285
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
the ride. Maybe I'm

3286
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
sad for some reason and like

3287
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I'm going on this and listening to

3288
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
that song like blasted

3289
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
at me. You want to create a heavy experience

3290
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
for yourself. Yeah.

3291
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And I think that's what I handled into a better headspace.

3292
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Yeah that was real. That's really intriguing to me

3293
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
the idea that I could go on there

3294
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
and be in like a thrilling

3295
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
situation but be sad.

3296
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And it's making me feel sad.

3297
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And kind of a good cathartic maybe sad.

3298
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I don't want something really to be wrong.

3299
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It's like melancholy more than

3300
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
or mixed emotion more than

3301
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
it's not a depressing song but it's

3302
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
yeah right right. It's just it's moody.

3303
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
And it's just like what you like you could bring.

3304
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It brings out a different feeling in your

3305
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
self. And I just I'd

3306
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
like to know what that feels like. Yeah.

3307
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah. That'd be if I

3308
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
if I could request a

3309
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
song for the second time doing it that would

3310
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
be my request. Yes. Yes. Yes.

3311
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
For sure. I have to say I agree

3312
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
with that. But the one that caught me off guard

3313
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
watching it and I don't

3314
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
think I realized it was one of the songs was

3315
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I ran so far away

3316
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
activated a memory of my

3317
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
mind of driving around in

3318
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Grand Theft Auto Vice City. Oh yeah.

3319
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Like stealing a car

3320
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
that comes on one of the radio

3321
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
stations and that was like

3322
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
one of the most awesome parts of

3323
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
the game. Sure. That's one

3324
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
that I will that's not a song I

3325
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
actively listen to and that almost feels like

3326
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
what Jane probably felt about Konga

3327
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
is like overused obvious I think about

3328
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
about that song. But then but also

3329
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
that's very callous of me. If you

3330
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
if it wasn't so played a ton

3331
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
and kind of like a go to

3332
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
this is what 80s music is. Yeah.

3333
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It's fucking great. It is really

3334
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
good. And I agree. I mean watching

3335
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
some ride throughs I was like

3336
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
it's yeah it's not my favorite song on here

3337
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
on its own but matched

3338
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
with the the ride aesthetics

3339
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
and kind of the and the peril

3340
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
and the the the story.

3341
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I thought it worked really

3342
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
well. Vice City another Florida connection.

3343
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Oh yeah. Yeah.

3344
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
It's supposed to be standing for Miami.

3345
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
So if

3346
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
they could have put Cortez the Killer by

3347
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Neil Young on here that would have maybe

3348
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
been the best choice.

3349
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
If you really want like to feel like

3350
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
you're in a sad haze

3351
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
a moody haze. But I

3352
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
understand why they didn't. And you've got

3353
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
all those Randy

3354
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Newman album cuts you want

3355
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
here. Randy Newman on a roller

3356
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
coaster. Is that on is he on RIPRIDE

3357
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Rocket? Do we know is he on the secret menu?

3358
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Maybe. I don't know. Is

3359
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
he show up a little on

3360
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Incredicoaster or

3361
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
California Screamin? I don't think he has music.

3362
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Is he on Music and Incredibles? It's probably

3363
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
the only Randy Newman you're getting is like

3364
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
well don't you hear it on

3365
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Slinky Dog probably. You get you get the

3366
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah you get the

3367
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
the swinging version of You Got a Friend in Me.

3368
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
The other the Spinner Ride in

3369
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Toy Story Land. It's all the techno

3370
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
remix of Strange Things Are

3371
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Happening to Me whatever it's called. Oh that's all over

3372
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Somaraland. Yeah yeah yeah.

3373
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Actually a lot of Randy Newman in

3374
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
the parks if you think about it. Yeah but not

3375
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Toy Story Land. Sorry Toy Story Land.

3376
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
The Little Gary Men.

3377
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
You're not getting something. What's your

3378
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
what's your Randy Newman coaster pick?

3379
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Oh my god that's a good question because do you

3380
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
want it to be as sad as possible?

3381
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Oh Baltimore

3382
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Ain't it hard?

3383
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Uh yeah that's a good

3384
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
question. I've talked about the song Wandering

3385
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Boy that makes me cry anytime I hear

3386
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
it. Oh so maybe it's that.

3387
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
You need to well you need to like meld

3388
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
some ride in your head that is

3389
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
that where you because there's some stuff

3390
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
that you you clearly want to go through

3391
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
on a ride. Yeah. So you need Wandering Boy

3392
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
that leads into your bravery

3393
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
has saved the planet.

3394
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
You found this man's boy.

3395
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Reunited a family

3396
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
for me. Family but a son who like

3397
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
goes like like I don't know he has troubles

3398
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
and they lose contact with him and then

3399
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
after this Prime's like you found his son

3400
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
you found the man's Wandering Boy.

3401
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Congratulations

3402
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
and I go oh my god. So

3403
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
do you think that's like would that be good

3404
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
for like Wild Mouse or

3405
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
more of like more of a

3406
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Dumbo kind of ride? What are you thinking? Spinner

3407
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
more of a spinner. Spinner ride. It is

3408
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
surprising there is not a firework show

3409
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
in DCA 1.0

3410
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
with I Love LA

3411
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
or other California

3412
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
numbers. Right they took they got every

3413
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
California song they could think of

3414
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
and not him. Mickey's Mix

3415
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Magic which I'm surprised I didn't force

3416
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
a second gate on which I

3417
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
really do like. 2024.

3418
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I don't know are they doing it anymore? I don't know I don't think

3419
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
so. What is it? It's like a light

3420
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
show on Main Street where they play like

3421
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
modernish sounding music with like

3422
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
different projections on Main Street. In

3423
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
what park? In Disneyland.

3424
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Disneyland. And I've

3425
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
not noticed it whatsoever.

3426
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Gosh it's brutal

3427
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
out here. And then it would

3428
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
end I think with We Belong

3429
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Together which is Randy Newman from Toy Story 3.

3430
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Which is a nice little song.

3431
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
So that's another

3432
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Newman in the Park.

3433
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Newman in the Park.

3434
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
That's the second gate maybe.

3435
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Now a close I said that

3436
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
my number two pick if I could choose

3437
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
would be Tears for Fears but

3438
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
it's a close one that

3439
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
maybe barely nudges out September.

3440
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Which seems fantastic song.

3441
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Would really and I love

3442
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
that they're doing the that they do play

3443
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
it all day. That's the only option

3444
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
on the 21st night of

3445
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
September.

3446
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
That's great. I think that

3447
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
would I don't know

3448
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I mean I just wanted the I wanted the party

3449
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
vibe. Yeah. Yeah. There's

3450
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
a time and place for the mood and for the feels

3451
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
but my first time I

3452
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
want to party so I think I would have been very

3453
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
happy with September as well. Yeah I would have been happy

3454
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
with that too. Yeah. Surprise watching

3455
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Ride Throughs Disco Inferno works

3456
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
pretty well too. It adds the conga

3457
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
sort of like party vibe.

3458
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. I don't think you can go

3459
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
wrong and then the kid next to me said

3460
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
he was like conga's the worst one.

3461
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Oh wow. What's the best one?

3462
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
He said one way or another.

3463
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Interesting. Yep. That's I mean I

3464
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
think it'll be fun. This kid was much more comfortable

3465
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
with the launch than me.

3466
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Well that's always what I

3467
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
look to whenever I'm doing something

3468
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
that's making me a little anxious and I go there's a

3469
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
11 year old boy in front of me.

3470
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I go surely

3471
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
you can handle this. Yeah.

3472
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Yeah. Well you pay taxes.

3473
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
You pay rent.

3474
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Yeah and I yell at him.

3475
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I go I pay taxes. I'm fine.

3476
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I'll be fine on this kid.

3477
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Some years I owe some. Some years

3478
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I get a refund. It's like living in a

3479
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
roller coaster. Yeah the

3480
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
approaching Velocicoaster and I was like

3481
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
it's going to be a little intense and then like

3482
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
the thing pulls up and I go half

3483
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
kids under 15

3484
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
on this. I go it's fine. I'll be

3485
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
okay. I got to do my best

3486
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
to make my boy one of those kids

3487
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
but right now

3488
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
at almost four it's

3489
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
not looking great.

3490
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
He is his

3491
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
dad's son. So far

3492
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
but I'm going to see what I can do. Well you never know.

3493
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Well Uncle Jason and Mike

3494
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
take it to Magic Mountain and do a

3495
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
dozen. Dozen slightly

3496
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
off coasters.

3497
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Alright have

3498
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
fun with the boys. Uncle Jason and Mike traumatize

3499
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
him on Twisted Colossus.

3500
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
You take a seven year old through the sewer of souls

3501
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
and it really will open them up.

3502
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
It will make them really

3503
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
want to do new stuff. Alright that's

3504
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
for the uncles to do. Dad doesn't get down with that stuff.

3505
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Great little graveyard pudding to put his mind at ease.

3506
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Hey and then afterwards you're

3507
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
hanging around deciding if you should

3508
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
leave or not because there's

3509
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
a vomit in progress. Apologies.

3510
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
This was the first time

3511
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
in 38 years I had ever been to

3512
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
a theme park with someone who was that

3513
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
nauseous. It never happened

3514
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
before. I think it had. I was with some people

3515
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
who had trouble with Space Mountain one time.

3516
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
It has happened. Reasonable. Amazing to see

3517
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
it happen to me. I'm like more afraid of it happening

3518
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
than it happening. But

3519
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
we're hanging around in kind of the post room and you get a little

3520
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
surrender. You still got your classic

3521
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
rock tree in there. That would have been great on the ride too.

3522
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Footloose plays. Surrender would totally work.

3523
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
That would work great. Is surrender in the

3524
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
exit part of

3525
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Mission Breakout? I don't know.

3526
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I feel like it might be but I'm missing

3527
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
things out. Maybe the area.

3528
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And then there's some music we haven't

3529
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
talked about but you guys told me right before we started

3530
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
recording that they aren't doing it this year.

3531
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Last year there was a holiday

3532
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
overlay. A Cosmic

3533
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Rewind holiday remix.

3534
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
And they aren't doing it.

3535
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Because I guess you were saying they

3536
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
are not promoting a new Guardians

3537
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Holiday Special. I don't know why they

3538
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
because they still do

3539
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
the overlay during

3540
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Halloween for Mission Breakout.

3541
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I don't know. Was it like

3542
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
poorly received in some way? Was there a reason

3543
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
that we don't know about why they wouldn't want to do it?

3544
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I think this is very cute too.

3545
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
They made the soundtrack Run Run

3546
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Rudolph but they changed the lyric to

3547
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Run Run Rocket. I think it sounds

3548
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
great. Yeah. If you guys listen to it

3549
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
because I heard it also

3550
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
incorporates other Christmas melodies

3551
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
in some way. I didn't

3552
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
know. I don't know.

3553
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I guess I haven't seen

3554
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
too many people talking about it in

3555
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
the sense that oh I hate that one. I wish it would do

3556
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
the regular song. So I'm not

3557
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
I don't know. I didn't know about

3558
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
the holiday Christmas

3559
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
parties at Magic Kingdom.

3560
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
There's like a crazy overlay

3561
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
on Space Mountain where they are like

3562
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
blaring Christmas

3563
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
music and flashing red and

3564
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
green lights. I would love

3565
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
to do that. Very weird in a good way.

3566
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
We talked about that last year and we saw a couple

3567
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
of videos and I was like they're doing

3568
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
what? This looks

3569
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
kind of dumb and

3570
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
not like

3571
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
there's not too much finesse to it. At least

3572
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
from videos. I like that.

3573
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I've seen like a warped Trans-Siberian

3574
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Orchestra album.

3575
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
The record was left out

3576
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
in the sun and then they played it.

3577
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
A very unique way to do

3578
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
an old

3579
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I don't want to say shitty but rough coaster

3580
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
at this point. Which we

3581
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
got to see with the lights on when we were on People Mover.

3582
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Oh that's right. Yes we did a People Mover pass

3583
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
which then because it was down for a long time

3584
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I didn't get to do it which I wanted to do.

3585
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I didn't do it either. I didn't see

3586
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
any fans. We saw no fans.

3587
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Well there were no conventional fans but

3588
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
there were places, yes, well that's

3589
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
a whole nother. That's stuck.

3590
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I didn't mean to start a discourse.

3591
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
No you did mean to and it's good.

3592
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
If it were a discourse I'd never bring it up

3593
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
again. I hate discourses.

3594
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Discussions and debates I

3595
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
like. If we can get a hold of

3596
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Tony Baxter. I swear I felt cold

3597
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
air blowing on me. I think there's

3598
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
something to it. It's cold in there.

3599
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I think there's something to the fan

3600
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
thing. It's just not fans

3601
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
in the way that there's a big fan

3602
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
next to you on the track. But I do think there's

3603
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
some sort of science to it or

3604
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
planning. Some sort of aggressive HVAC

3605
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
system. Yes that's what I

3606
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
think and we're going to need

3607
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
to talk to some Imagineer who might

3608
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
be able to tell us. Well this is going to delay

3609
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
the Space Mountain episode

3610
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
even longer. It's needing to get a coherent

3611
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
answer on this.

3612
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Moments in the ride.

3613
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
It's tough to say because it is just a big

3614
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
disorienting thing.

3615
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
But it does like

3616
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
it's all bad for a podcast right?

3617
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Where we're supposed to

3618
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
verbally go through things

3619
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
in a way that

3620
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
makes some sense. But you get off

3621
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
the thing and you're just like oh in the one

3622
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
part and the other part. You're kind of

3623
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
like it feels like you're like a little sideways.

3624
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
None of this is good to say

3625
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
out loud. The only one that I could maybe vocalize

3626
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
is well unfortunately the part that made Jane

3627
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
sick. Yes it's the moon.

3628
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
When I've been trying to illustrate to people how cool it is

3629
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
that you can pick these like pivot

3630
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
points. It happens with the moon and it happens I think with Earth

3631
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
too. That

3632
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
your car perfectly

3633
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
rotates to like

3634
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
stare at this central planet

3635
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
point. Those moments

3636
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
are so thrilling. I bet it gives you

3637
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
a little bit of what staring

3638
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
at the goat on Big Thunder gives you.

3639
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
But they're doing it on purpose. Oh yeah.

3640
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
They make you crane your neck for it. Yeah I think that's

3641
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
right. I'm

3642
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
very impressed with

3643
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
however they figured out how to make

3644
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
things bright but not

3645
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
show off the building.

3646
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Yeah. That kind of inward

3647
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
light that doesn't let you see the track.

3648
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Yeah because yeah you don't necessarily

3649
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
it's not calling attention to

3650
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
the fact that you're in a building all that often.

3651
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
And I believe

3652
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I don't know if it's the exact same technology

3653
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
but going on Space Mountain a couple weeks

3654
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
ago they have now

3655
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
projected stars much more

3656
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
brightly onto the walls.

3657
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
And there are like little nebula things.

3658
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Has it improved lately? Yes.

3659
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I haven't been on it in a while. Yeah for sure. Because it was down

3660
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
for a little while and I think

3661
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
it was I think I was there actually the day it

3662
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
opened because I hadn't been on it

3663
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
in so long. And for sure

3664
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
the stars are brighter. I saw other people mention this.

3665
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
And a lot of the projections

3666
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
are they're not

3667
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
quality of this Rive Guardians of

3668
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
course but it was very noticeable

3669
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
that they're using some

3670
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
different thing or. The star projections

3671
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
in this ride are great.

3672
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Yeah oh yeah. But I wonder

3673
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
if they learned something on this

3674
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
and that's what they're using or who knows.

3675
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Yeah maybe. Well it feels like

3676
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
this ride is going

3677
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
to influence a lot of rides

3678
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
going forward. I hope that in redoing

3679
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Space Mountains that you

3680
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
get some of this technology overlaps. I hope that

3681
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
there's another Omni coaster again.

3682
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Mike your theory you just

3683
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
fully thought this Tokyo

3684
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Disneyland fully knew Space

3685
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Mountain. You're like it's got to just be this.

3686
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I bet. I don't know what else would you. I don't

3687
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
know because it's such you're on it you're going

3688
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
oh this is Space Mountain with like

3689
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
a rock and roll song. Yeah.

3690
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
This is just Space Mountain with pop music.

3691
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
So I don't know. Don't discount

3692
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Dick Dale. Dick Dale was on

3693
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
there before. That's true you're right.

3694
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I did like that. Dick Dale kicked

3695
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
the door open. He broke the rock ceiling.

3696
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
That's true you're right. Yeah.

3697
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Michael Giacchino. Yes.

3698
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Well that's not. Which I like

3699
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
that song too but it's not as rock and roll

3700
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
as Dick Dale. I like I prefer Dick Dale.

3701
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I like Dick Dale. I guess you

3702
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
did it with Dick the Dick Dale song. Yeah.

3703
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That's right. Right when I started going on Space

3704
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Mountain that was new in the

3705
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
soundtrack. And of course I did do Space Mountain with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

3706
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
So I did rock on

3707
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Space Mountain. So it's certainly not

3708
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
without precedent.

3709
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I've gotten to rock at Disneyland.

3710
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Although

3711
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
no it was

3712
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
that was on California

3713
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Screamin. I don't remember. Around the world

3714
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I believe. I believe Higher

3715
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Ground is on Space Mountain. I think so.

3716
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Makes sense. Well let's

3717
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
get Imagine Dragons in there.

3718
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Let's get the Chain

3719
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Smokers on Incredicoaster. Some of the

3720
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
new great rock music that's out there.

3721
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Some of the new rockers. With this.

3722
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Credo Van Fleet. With this

3723
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
technology and seeing this ride

3724
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
as a space ride. How would you not

3725
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
just use this? Unless they have something cooler.

3726
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Which they might.

3727
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
We need more. I think Omni Coasters

3728
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
should not be specific

3729
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
to Guardians in this ride.

3730
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
If there is an Omni Coaster that

3731
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
fits better into one of the Disneyland parks

3732
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
get it in there ASAP. If you can get an Omni Coaster

3733
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
in Animal Kingdom. That's what I was trying to figure out too.

3734
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Throw it anywhere. I want all the

3735
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Omni Coasters we can muster up.

3736
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I was trying to figure out where. Cause Space

3737
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Mountain I guess. They've talked

3738
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
about redoing it out here. redoing obviously

3739
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
all of Tomorrowland. We've talked about it many times.

3740
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
We'll continue. As we've said

3741
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
on our show. Our Tomorrowland

3742
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
redo thoughts will bleed into 2024

3743
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
at this point. Yes. Like Disney we

3744
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
have pushed our Tomorrowland plans

3745
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
into the future. We have plans though.

3746
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
We ran out of budget. We ran out

3747
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
of budget. That's really a budget thing. The SD

3748
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
card is full and we don't need

3749
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
it's not like you can just buy them at CVS

3750
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
now. We use special ones

3751
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
handcrafted. Podcast The Right Imagineer

3752
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
who was in charge of our Tomorrowland

3753
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
episodes have been they've been fired.

3754
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
All of them have been fired. They've all

3755
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
they've all been scooped up by

3756
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Doughboy. They've all jumped.

3757
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
We had to fire them though. Cause they were making

3758
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
too much money. Yeah.

3759
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
They were bleeding. So all of our Tomorrowland

3760
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
researchers. All 10 of them

3761
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
laid off. Gone. Like the Imagineers

3762
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
of Animal Kingdom jumping

3763
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
over to Lost Continent.

3764
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
So I guess

3765
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
yeah there's a world like cause at this point

3766
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
it's like oh it's gonna be

3767
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Tron. They're gonna move Tron into Disneyland

3768
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
and like

3769
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I'm more interested in just

3770
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Guardians going.

3771
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I would take look

3772
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
this is gonna be crazy maybe

3773
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
if I haven't said this out loud. I haven't even

3774
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
allowed myself to think it. Would I

3775
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
trade our Space Mountain for Guardians

3776
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
of the Galaxy right now in Disneyland?

3777
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
And the answer is yes.

3778
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I think my answer is also yes.

3779
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Demolish Space Mountain. Wow.

3780
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I think the only way

3781
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
there's no way they have room. I know that's Blue

3782
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Sky. I understand.

3783
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
This box is just too big. So Space Mountain

3784
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I get it. I know it's probably safe

3785
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
from what I'm saying. But

3786
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
it's so close to

3787
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
the Space Mountain vibe already

3788
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
just with songs like

3789
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
yeah give it to me.

3790
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Give me this. It's

3791
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
better ride. Where could

3792
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
an Omnicoaster

3793
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
go

3794
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
on the Disneyland property?

3795
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
With the size you mean? Yeah.

3796
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Let me ask Jason real quick

3797
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
what he thinks of that controversial statement.

3798
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Would you trade?

3799
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
The devil shows up to your door

3800
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
and he says you can get rid of

3801
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Space Mountain and have Guardians

3802
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind if you want Jason.

3803
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I mean I was of the mind too of like

3804
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
oh this sucks we can't ride this

3805
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
again today. Either because of

3806
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Virtual Queue or Lightning Lanes.

3807
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It sounds like you're gonna join Scott and I on the

3808
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
devil's side. Jason's

3809
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
first question probably is like

3810
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
sorry devil

3811
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
that's what you're bringing to me. I can't

3812
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
like end the war.

3813
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I can't. Well the devil doesn't want

3814
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
to end the war. Yeah the devil loves war.

3815
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Devil is evil.

3816
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I just

3817
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
want to disappoint these Twitter

3818
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
people. Unless it's hot stuff the little

3819
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
devil. But that's not the devil I'm talking

3820
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
about. I'm talking about Christian devil.

3821
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
The reality of like

3822
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
there's already Guardians Ride

3823
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
at California Adventure. There's

3824
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
already a Marvel campus.

3825
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
But I really really

3826
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
liked this. Join us

3827
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Jason. Join us.

3828
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Yeah baby.

3829
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
You want to talk about Disneyland

3830
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Tomorrowland.

3831
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
It was looking a little rough when I first

3832
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
got out here in 2006.

3833
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Let alone in 2023.

3834
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
The thing is though like

3835
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
we can't. I mean getting

3836
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
rid of Space Mountain doesn't. Space Mountain

3837
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
isn't the problem and it shouldn't suffer. No it's

3838
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
not. But I agree it would be. I mean yes I

3839
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
would make this trade. No I love the Space Mountain out here. The Space

3840
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Mountain Florida has fucked me up

3841
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
in recent years. It's rough.

3842
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
It's like Matterhorn level

3843
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
rough. Well let me ask

3844
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
my question was if we can

3845
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
reverse engineer where is there room on

3846
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
property and let's take that Disneyland Forward

3847
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
shit out. Well that's sadly the answer.

3848
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
It's maybe the only hope but let's say that

3849
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
gets canceled. City doesn't approve it.

3850
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
We want an Omni coaster somewhere at Disneyland

3851
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
where possibly

3852
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
and let's work backwards.

3853
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Let's like. Like where's the

3854
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
space. Yeah and let's

3855
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
if we determine that somehow it's in

3856
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Frontierland it's got to be an old west Omni coaster.

3857
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
If it's in Fantasyland I know

3858
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
there isn't. I know it's not that.

3859
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Using

3860
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Disneyland Forward I think that's where

3861
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
you get the space. Either it wraps

3862
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
around the Disneyland Hotel.

3863
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Yeah I'm taking that off. I mean you're right

3864
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
that's it. I'm taking that off the table. Let's say

3865
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
that is done. I'll tell you where there's

3866
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
space. The Toy Story parking lot.

3867
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Okay. A huge amount

3868
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
of space. That's still. Yeah yeah.

3869
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Cheating. Cheating. We're mainland

3870
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Disneyland only. Mainland Disneyland.

3871
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I'm boxing you in.

3872
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
We have to. We got to. Would you take

3873
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
a. How about this. You know how there's room

3874
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
in Frontierland. If you get rid of Frontierland

3875
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
would you blow up Rivers

3876
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
of America and all of it to get an

3877
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Omni coaster. Well okay what does that look

3878
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
like. Is that just a big building now where the

3879
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
river is. I don't know. They could put something nice

3880
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
on the outside. You're going to have to expand

3881
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
on what this looks like for me to approve

3882
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
it. Okay okay okay. Cause like the vibe there

3883
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
is so good. Don't put a bunch of trees on top of it.

3884
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
You won't be able to. Really tall trees.

3885
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I think I've got it. What's that?

3886
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Big stretch of land. You

3887
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
got Pixar Pier

3888
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
and Paradise Carpets Park. Oh my goodness.

3889
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
That's going to be weird too. But now you're

3890
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
through space. But that's a lift. Now you're getting rid of a

3891
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
coaster though. Now you're

3892
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
trading it for a better

3893
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
coaster though. Better but

3894
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Credit Coaster is very good too.

3895
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Well but also

3896
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
then that gets rid of the

3897
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
vibe. That gets rid of the

3898
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
hangout of the pier

3899
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
and the water. And you've gotten rid of Toy Story

3900
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Media too. Or you think all that.

3901
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I think yeah I think all that.

3902
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
But the water stays. In terms of

3903
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
vibe I would rather keep

3904
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Grizzly Peak which people are already

3905
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
speculating that

3906
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
will become Avatar stuff.

3907
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
They keep saying experience.

3908
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Avatar is going to be so. They keep saying experience.

3909
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I think it's going to be a smoking gun.

3910
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Sound stages. Using

3911
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
a sound stage. That's right. It's going to be where

3912
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
the Tron Arcade was. Well first of all

3913
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
okay. I think I have an answer. Before we

3914
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
get all severe over

3915
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
in the pier. Severe in

3916
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
before we get severe in the pier.

3917
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
As I was saying earlier. Hollywood's

3918
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
gone. That's what I'm saying. Flowing up.

3919
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Any Omni- just do Guardians.

3920
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Do it there. Forget the Wonder. Do a different

3921
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
lead in than Wonders of Xandar. I don't care that

3922
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
there's already a Guardians right. Just put it

3923
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
there. Whenever the arch. Like whenever you

3924
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
leave like the area by

3925
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Carthay and you go right next to like the Disney Junior

3926
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Theater. That's when you can start

3927
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
destroying things.

3928
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
They're getting rid of that Beast's

3929
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
castle walkthrough which I always

3930
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
forget is there. Oh the library. Which is

3931
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
really cool. It is a little

3932
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
like fun thing. Have you ever done it? Do we need to do

3933
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
like an RIP for that? I kind of think we do.

3934
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I haven't been on in a while. I almost want to get down there.

3935
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
It closes soon. I almost want to

3936
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
get down there and walk through it. In the animation building.

3937
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I forgot about it the last couple years. I

3938
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
remember stumbling upon it years

3939
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
ago and going wow this is cool. This is a cool little

3940
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
thing. Awesome Planet. Beast's library.

3941
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Beast's library. When

3942
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
it was really cool when they had that

3943
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
and the Toy Story Zoe trope

3944
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
in there. Oh that was great. What are they

3945
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
called? Which is in the Academy

3946
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Museum now. That's maybe right.

3947
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I don't remember seeing that. I thought I heard

3948
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
that move there. What you can do I think

3949
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
is you can get rid of all those buildings.

3950
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
You can get rid of award wieners. You can go

3951
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
all the way back. Get rid of Monsters Inc.

3952
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Award wieners

3953
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
can move. I would rather

3954
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
keep award wieners than

3955
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Monsters Inc.

3956
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Hang on.

3957
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
There will be

3958
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
the same quality of hot dog which is

3959
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
to say C plus hot dog

3960
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
can be maintained somewhere else

3961
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
on property. I have

3962
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I know I'm not

3963
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I am the only one but I have always

3964
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
had good luck with film strip fries.

3965
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So if you can move the hot dogs

3966
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
and film strip fries.

3967
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I'm not with you on film strip fries at all.

3968
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I think those are delightful. They're fine.

3969
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I'm not against film strip fries.

3970
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
But I would say that I don't

3971
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
make them make them available

3972
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
at the sit down Carthay circle.

3973
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Now you can get

3974
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
that as a $15

3975
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
side for the table.

3976
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Loaded Irish nacho film strip fries.

3977
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
There was just a little cart that said award

3978
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
wieners that had one hot dog and

3979
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
film strip fries. I'll take it.

3980
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
That's fine. That's mobile. We cleared the area.

3981
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Monsters Inc. blow it up of course.

3982
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
All those sound stages blow it up.

3983
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
The plan too at a certain point when they had that parking

3984
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
garage which I think is eventually still the plan

3985
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
on the other side of harbor and you were going to have all the

3986
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
security over on the other side of harbor and

3987
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
have the bridge have the pedestrian bridge.

3988
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
They were going to move like

3989
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
the boundaries of California Adventure out

3990
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
into the Esplanade.

3991
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
So there would be more room there as well.

3992
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
So you get rid of those different sound stages.

3993
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
You get rid of Monsters Inc. You get rid of all those

3994
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
streets. Then you can get rid of the theater even though

3995
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I like the idea that you could have a thing.

3996
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
But if we need to get space space space for

3997
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
this crazy coaster.

3998
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Get rid of it and then you push out back that way.

3999
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And then I think

4000
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
you could even like do

4001
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
something crazy and have the like walkway

4002
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
be like under the

4003
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
ride

4004
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
like building like have some sort

4005
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
of like oh yeah screen

4006
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
thing where you walk under like you're walking into

4007
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
like a jump point or something

4008
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
and you could walk that way through

4009
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
to like the Mission Breakout and then to

4010
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Avengers Campus. You could do something

4011
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
weird like that where then the show building was maybe

4012
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
above and theme it somehow.

4013
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
That would be a little bit extreme but

4014
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
that's a lot of space I think right there.

4015
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I'll say this I'll go so

4016
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
far as to say re-theme this

4017
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
to the constantly changing

4018
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
question mark Avengers

4019
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
E ticket.

4020
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Sure. Yeah. And you can use the multiverse

4021
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
idea. Fine yes.

4022
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Yes put it there just two guardians rides.

4023
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I mean yeah the song wise

4024
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Avengers doesn't the pop song wise it's not

4025
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
as fun but still the technology is

4026
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
amazing and I guess you can have a big

4027
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Thanos or you know what really would be

4028
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
good. You know what really would be good.

4029
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
It's fantastic for overlay for

4030
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
this and have Galactus be

4031
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
the sort of projection character

4032
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
and have him sort of going around

4033
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
and then Silver Surfer as well.

4034
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
And Johnny Storm is a bit of a playboy, a bit of a party boy.

4035
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Maybe he's putting on some tunes.

4036
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Yeah he absolutely is.

4037
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Why he was played by

4038
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
have Chris Evans replace

4039
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
the role. Have you ever seen Scott

4040
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
have you ever seen the clip of the

4041
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
90s Fantastic Four where Johnny

4042
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Storm the Human Torch. No no no

4043
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
the cartoon where he like kind

4044
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
of raps. No. You should

4045
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
see this. I think you would really like this.

4046
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Flame on flame on

4047
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
and on and on and on.

4048
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
It's really good. You should look it up.

4049
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Here's what I want. I want

4050
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Herbie the robot from the

4051
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
old 80s 70s

4052
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
cartoon whatever it is. You could do a great

4053
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
cue of going through the Baxter building.

4054
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Obviously which is a big laboratory

4055
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
stuff going on aliens popping

4056
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
out robots Reeds

4057
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Lab Ben Grimm's

4058
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
again like you know I want to see

4059
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
where everybody sleeps. Yeah I want to see

4060
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
where the thing sleeps. I want to see where

4061
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Mr.

4062
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Mrs. Fantastic conceived

4063
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
their children Franklin and

4064
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Valeria. Valeria.

4065
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I want to get handled and I want to see where my friends

4066
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
sleep. That's correct. So Scott

4067
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
do you know about Herbie the robot.

4068
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
No. Okay so I know

4069
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
about this because Blockbuster had some

4070
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
video compilations

4071
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
in the you know VHS days.

4072
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
There was a Fantastic

4073
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Four cartoon but when they made

4074
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
it they were too concerned

4075
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
about the human torch inspiring

4076
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
children to light themselves on

4077
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
fire. So they replaced

4078
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
the human torch and the fourth member

4079
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
of the Fantastic Four was this annoying

4080
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
little guy named Herbie the robot

4081
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
or he was named

4082
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Herbie and he was a robot

4083
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
and he did not

4084
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
really have a power set.

4085
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Quite equivalent

4086
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
to a guy who can generate

4087
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
flames. Okay okay but

4088
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
can we get some kind of Herbie the robot

4089
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
like pop and lock challenge

4090
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
happening in the parks. Yes we can.

4091
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I've sent you the human torch song. I don't know.

4092
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I'm saying all these multiverse

4093
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
things that they're experimenting with

4094
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
let's get Herbie in there.

4095
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Let's get Spiderman

4096
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
and his amazing friends Iceman

4097
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
and Firestorm in there.

4098
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I've been looking

4099
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
down if it

4100
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
seems like I was tuning out because it was Marvel talk. That's not

4101
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
exactly right. I was just trying to see physical

4102
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
footprint and if this would work in either

4103
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
of the areas and I can't quite determine my Google

4104
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Maps aren't lining up very well but if

4105
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
it could and I'm curious if any

4106
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
listeners are mad about any of this. Would you

4107
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
listeners would you sacrifice

4108
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
planned Avengers

4109
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
e-ticket that never seems to come

4110
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
and would you sacrifice all

4111
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
of Hollywood Muppet

4112
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Vision, rarely used theater

4113
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
and or that's Spectro

4114
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Magic. Spectro Magic. Yeah and Philhar

4115
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Magic. Who can't afford Philhar Magic. I answered my own question.

4116
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Blow it up and then

4117
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I think yeah I think Hollywood's out for this.

4118
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Yeah. That's great. I think that's really good.

4119
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
That's a fun little

4120
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
spirit of debate I think

4121
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
and I don't want to open it up into

4122
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
a whole other thing but just on the way

4123
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
out the door

4124
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
we could solve this later because we have other candidates

4125
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
in the question I'm about to ask

4126
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
to discuss down the road. Is

4127
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind

4128
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
the best ride in Orlando?

4129
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Oh baby.

4130
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
It's a good question.

4131
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I don't think

4132
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
that would be a controversial

4133
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
thing to say.

4134
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
No but you couldn't

4135
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I don't think you'd get mad at anybody for saying that.

4136
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Pretty

4137
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I'm still sticking

4138
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
with Spider-Man.

4139
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Spider-Man is still great.

4140
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I 100% knew that would be your answer.

4141
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Because I wrote it.

4142
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
It's still very good. It is good. Yes.

4143
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
It's good. I was in front of a family

4144
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
who was like clapping and laughing

4145
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
the whole time and I'm like

4146
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
this is still getting me to react.

4147
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I think there's no question that Spider-Man

4148
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
at least in Orlando maybe

4149
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
all told that it is I think it is

4150
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
the best

4151
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
non-coaster thrilling

4152
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
fair enough. Dark ride style.

4153
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
And the only thing that would just notch

4154
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
it up is how great and expansive

4155
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
and exciting the coaster is.

4156
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I will say this.

4157
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I do think obviously

4158
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
the theming is less cool.

4159
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
The Velocicoaster

4160
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
handles me in a more

4161
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
slightly more fun way.

4162
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I almost

4163
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
if I was just

4164
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
closing my eyes and feeling

4165
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
the thrill of being moved around

4166
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
the Velocicoaster

4167
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
might have the edge.

4168
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
There's a little trick right at the end of

4169
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Velocicoaster that's hooked my breath away.

4170
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
There's a couple things but especially

4171
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
the thing you're talking about at the end.

4172
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
There's just

4173
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
parts of it where

4174
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
if I close my eyes. So that's the only reason I'm giving it

4175
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
pause. I think maybe overall you still say

4176
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Cosmic Rewind is the best.

4177
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
But that's the only reason I'm giving it pause

4178
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
because there's stuff about

4179
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Velocicoaster that I

4180
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
again I can't stop thinking about.

4181
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I just can't stop thinking about the

4182
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
handling. I just get handled.

4183
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I just put on Cortez the Killer

4184
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
and I sit and listen and think about

4185
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
these rides and when will I get to do them again?

4186
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
If you listen to the long song

4187
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Cortez the Killer and it reminds you

4188
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
that you're sad you can't always be

4189
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
on this roller coaster. I want to always be

4190
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
riding. ABR.

4191
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Always be riding. That's what I want.

4192
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Or ABBH.

4193
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Always being handled.

4194
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I mean look you can get off

4195
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Guardians, walk across the park

4196
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
and board the Skyliner.

4197
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Velocicoaster you can get

4198
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
off and walk to the water taxi

4199
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
in City Walk

4200
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
and take a nice little boat ride.

4201
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Should that count?

4202
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I'm just talking about nice

4203
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
fun modes of transit

4204
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
that I would like to do

4205
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
back to back.

4206
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
I'm just saying Skyliner

4207
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
boat. Both very sad

4208
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
and flying. Things that have nothing to do with the ride.

4209
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
These are nothing to do with the ride.

4210
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I'm just constructing

4211
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
my perfect little day.

4212
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
You have a more gentle

4213
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
definition of handling.

4214
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I would say I wouldn't argue

4215
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
with that statement

4216
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
but there's a few things

4217
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
that just slightly give me

4218
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
pause and maybe when we do Velocicoaster

4219
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I will definitively say what I think.

4220
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Okay, well I think that is

4221
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
going to be a 2024

4222
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
thing. We're getting close to the end of the

4223
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
year here so that's something to look forward to.

4224
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Velocicoaster, the full debate

4225
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
of what is the best

4226
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
ride in Orlando which could lead to what is

4227
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
the best ride on Earth.

4228
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
On planet Earth. Or Xandar

4229
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
will determine that I guess next

4230
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
year but for now you survived

4231
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
podcast the ride.

4232
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Boy, how great does it feel

4233
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
to just talk about a great

4234
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
cool ride.

4235
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Sometimes is it as funny as

4236
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
talking about an awful nightmare

4237
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
or a funny bad thing?

4238
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Not necessarily. But it's fun

4239
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
for us. I think

4240
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
it takes us right back to how we were getting

4241
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
handled. This is all about how we're getting

4242
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
handled. It's an audio handling.

4243
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
There's different dialogue

4244
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
at the end of the ride. Oh right!

4245
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
There's some gopeteista lines.

4246
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
There's a questioning whether they're heroes

4247
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
or whether you're heroes or not

4248
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
because you kind of just sat there.

4249
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Similar to the end of Mission Breakout.

4250
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Yeah, he says it's honorary,

4251
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
they joke about that, they say they're

4252
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
not coming with us. There's a weird

4253
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Epcot line that it stands for

4254
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
every person comes out

4255
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
tired and I'm like, I don't know

4256
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
if that one works, but the other ones are pretty

4257
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
solid.

4258
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I didn't know they changed those out actually. Thanks for

4259
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
reminding me of that.

4260
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Exiting that, going

4261
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
back through that tunnel.

4262
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Talk about topping

4263
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Space Mountain.

4264
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Dark rides kind of through

4265
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
space that end with a big cool tunnel.

4266
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
They did it a little better. It's a great

4267
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
tunnel at the end there. There's a great

4268
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
hologram

4269
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
feature.

4270
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Also,

4271
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I know we're winding it down, but

4272
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
there's those rides where

4273
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
that was fantastic

4274
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
but that was it.

4275
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I like Tron. I absolutely like

4276
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Tron, but Tron finishes and you're like, okay, that was

4277
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
it. Mike, that's your

4278
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
complaint about Journey to the Center of the Earth,

4279
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
which is valid, you're not wrong.

4280
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
It's literally a shorter ride.

4281
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I like it, but I don't give a knock

4282
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
at those points.

4283
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I think it'd be really hard to feel

4284
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
that way about Guardians of the Galaxy.

4285
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
It's a long ride.

4286
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
The person

4287
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
who doesn't feel satisfied by it

4288
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
is a bitter

4289
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
cynical is a real

4290
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Cortez the killer.

4291
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I take it back, every person in our

4292
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
party did come out tired

4293
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
of Epcot, but Mike

4294
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
wild away the early morning hours

4295
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
at Jelly Rolls.

4296
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Not everybody

4297
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
comes out of Epcot tired.

4298
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Not every person came out tired.

4299
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000

Awesome Planet, Beasts

4309
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Library, and a full hypothetical Cortez

4310
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
the killer

4311
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
emotional roller coaster.

4312
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I think I know where you're going with this Mike.

4313
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
It's a little long so we'll see if I chop

4314
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
any of it.

4315
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
It's like when Brian Austin Green

4316
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
did music on 90210.

4317
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I like this. I

4318
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
full on like it.

4319
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
This is much more credible rap music

4320
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
than I was expecting.

4321
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Put it on the right,

4322
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
put it on the right.

4323
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Put it on the right, put it on the right.

4324
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Sick!

4325
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
