1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,680
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
Welcome to your podcast, There's No Turning Back.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,720
I'm Scott Gardiner, joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm here and I'm feeling it.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
I'm feeling this.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:38,120
Even though it's been a little bit of time, but you still feel like I was worried that some of the magic would dissipate, but you feel like you're tapping back in.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,800
Yeah, I am. I listened to the song on repeat as I came here.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I drove in the car today.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
That'll do it.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
And spun your car in circles, donut after donut.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yep.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah, donuts in the parking lot and on the road.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,720
Bought a big globe and put it in the center of a church parking lot.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,320
And I had the Eternals on in the car.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
On the laptop.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
So one of the giant Celestials was.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Yeah, yeah. Oh, a Celestial is in Eternals.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,280
I see. Yes, yes, they are.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
I must have fallen asleep.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Believe it or not.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,520
Too early to figure that out.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
Jason Sheridan, welcome.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,640
Hi, I'm here too.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:25,040
You know, the Eternals got like a marquee crossover a couple of years ago in the Marvel comics with the Avengers and the X-Men.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,280
And the impact was like you dropped a pebble in a lake.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,160
I feel like I feel like it did not move the needle.

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,400
For our pals, for Kingo and Sprite, these are these these guys can move needles miles at a time.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,640
Yeah, they can move needles with their minds, right?

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,760
That's what the Eternals do.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,680
That's right. Yeah, I got it.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,000
Jason took a time.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,040
Yeah, Jason do shitting on the Eternals.

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,560
No, no, that they even lost.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,640
They did not announce them on the doomsday in the chairs.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,840
They did not announce any of the Eternals on the chairs.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Do you know the chairs?

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,120
Oh, yeah.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
You've heard of the chairs?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,680
So they're not all these all these all these Marvel actors have mentioned.

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,920
There wasn't it didn't just go to one that said Sprite.

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,520
It didn't have a no, it didn't.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,720
So we'll see that.

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,880
Maybe it's a surprise.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,760
Yeah, yeah, that's why I think I this is how much I'm not even thinking about what I'm on, how much my focus is different with this ride.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,640
With Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Ruin is that I don't think I realize until right now this is a Marvel thing that I love.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,440
Right.

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:40,680
That's how much I just don't even I'm like maybe not paying attention to like the story or any of the specifics of what's happening.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,200
It's like I guess is that weird that like 90 percent of my enjoyment has nothing to do with the Marvel of it.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,920
Isn't that the whole thing with this podcast in general?

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:05,440
It's a recurring often happens and that we can be tricked into liking almost anything as long as it, you know, it moves us around, spins us around, moves us physically, moves us, moves us emotionally, which I think we're going to talk about today.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Well, I said in the I think when we were walking through the queue, I said, isn't it funny that James Gunn is responsible for the tone and the fun of two major rides?

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,840
Yeah, that's the way you think of like movies now.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:29,600
At least I think of movies that way now is that if they're hits, then they can be rides and that's the way we get big, expensive, cool rides.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,880
And it's just because James Gunn took a meeting in whatever 2013.

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,200
And I don't I don't know if the muse I think he put the music like the needle drops in the script that was there.

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:52,200
OK, so like there was a script, I think somebody had I forget a woman's name, Nicole, something I think had had like pulled the Guardians of the Galaxy out of the Marvel, like sea listers and was like, oh, this might be interesting.

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,000
And then James Gunn came in to like get a directing job and then he rewrote it.

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:06,400
But it's because of that now that we have two rides like this and that going forward now is why you have to root for the box office of certain movies.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
We really do.

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:20,720
If Fantastic Four is kind of cool looking, it doesn't matter if you like the movie, but you have to root for if you like the aesthetic, because then we will get a ride or a Tomorrowland redo.

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Well, look, the Minecraft ride is going to be terrific.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
That was a hit.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Sure.

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Who made who made who made Minecraft?

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,040
Do we know?

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,520
I don't remember that can make rides.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,840
Yeah.

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,440
Or is it in one of the dead zones?

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
It might be in one of the dead zones.

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,480
Is it a Warner Brothers discovery?

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,040
That's a nice thing.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,080
We don't have to root for anything on the Warner Brothers.

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,960
That's true.

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
Although they sometimes work with Universal, I guess.

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes, true.

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:54,880
So you can, but it feels less I can't tell right now if we have to root for Ketchup Entertainment, the company that saved the Coyote vs. Acme and that I think put out the other one.

78
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,840
I don't know where the theme park alliances of Ketchup Entertainment are.

79
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't know.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,160
But if we get Ketchup World somewhere in this country or abroad, I could see that.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
That becomes Ketchup World Abu Dhabi.

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
Yeah, it might happen.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,880
This is a wonderful tie-in with the Heinz company.

84
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,400
You'd have to think, where does Heinz manufacture out of?

85
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Well, it was originally based in Pittsburgh.

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,240
Okay.

87
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,680
Well, then maybe that's a good thing.

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
Maybe they need to embrace their name.

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,880
I don't know who they are or why they're called Ketchup Entertainment or why they are saving the Looney Tunes, but I like what they're doing.

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
And maybe they plant in Pittsburgh, just make it a Ketchup town.

91
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,440
Sure.

92
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,360
And then it's like half a Hershey-style factory tour and half all of our favorite characters from the Ketchup Entertainment.

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,840
Yeah, sure.

94
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
Also, now I'm having this thought as well.

95
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
Part of the reason there's Guardians Galaxy rides is because of the deal with Universal,

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,880
where they can't make Marvel rides based on the characters that are represented in Islands of Adventure.

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,800
Guardians are not there, so that's the loophole.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Are the Eternals anywhere in Islands of Adventure?

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't believe they are.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Like if they're even on a cup.

101
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,240
Right.

102
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Well, they might be in that big, like the crystals with the paintings, the big events.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
I bet they're not.

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
I don't know that they are.

105
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,880
I bet they're not.

106
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
So I bet you could do an Eternals ride in Florida.

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,320
That's a guess, but that could be another Marvel thing they were allowed.

108
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,960
So I may have to take all of this back.

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,000
That's what I'm getting at.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,640
And start embracing the Eternals.

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:30,880
Right.

112
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,760
Start playing with the many, many toys that Griffin has bought for my children.

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,920
At least 30 different Eternals toys.

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, right.

115
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm not a toy collector like you.

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,160
Right.

117
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,200
So I think like the majority, not the majority, but a solid percentage.

118
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I guess if he had up all my son's toys.

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,680
I don't know.

120
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
Like 10% of the toys in the house are Eternals toys, thanks to Griffin Noon.

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
A lot of ironic toys.

122
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
But I have to lose all iron.

123
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,280
It has to all become incredibly sincere.

124
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,040
If I could get a launch coaster that shoots me through a portal

125
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,960
that turns me into a perennial 12-year-old like Sprite.

126
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,680
Yeah, right.

127
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,000
They found the Eternal Youth.

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
It's kind of a cousin of Indiana Jones.

129
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,560
The making of me type of a ride.

130
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Oh, yeah, great.

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,480
Let's get really specific with the language.

133
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,840
And really like intimate with the language.

134
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,160
Right.

135
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,040
What it takes to keep Sprite 12 forever.

136
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,800
Yeah.

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
Let's get that same writer to write all that copy.

138
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,440
It could happen.

139
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
It's some sort of boy who never grows up.

140
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,800
That's good.

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,320
I feel like missing something.

142
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,440
It's right there in front of me and I can't put my finger on it.

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,200
But the Guardians of the Galaxy, the aesthetic and the vibe.

144
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,920
Wait, I have a question.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,320
Did you mean Peter Pan or did you mean Clifford?

146
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Because we have two competing.

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,160
Well, I was joking about Peter Pan, but definitely more preferential to a different boy.

148
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
I went to Clifford because I'd rather go to Clifford,

149
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
even though Clifford is also incredibly creepy.

150
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Well, it's got a theme park.

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
It's got a theme park in there.

152
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,120
Yeah, it does.

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh, yeah, exactly.

154
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,320
But I was just saying because the aesthetic of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a little bit

155
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,760
dry in some ways, especially if you're doing the Avengers campus aesthetic or whatever.

156
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,280
But this, because this was a hit, we get a fun thing that is close to

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
excitement of a comic book that Jason and I are so fond of.

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,720
And because of and where I still don't care about it, particularly with that,

159
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:45,760
because of the choice that James Gunn made, it is basically all just turned into a new, dare I say,

160
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,960
dare I look you in the eyes, Mike, and say, better rock and roller coaster with maybe, maybe,

161
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,000
and I don't want to start things off on a sour note, but maybe.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm just going to throw this out here.

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,520
OK, go ahead.

164
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,200
I can't even do it. I'm going to look at Jason and say, yeah, fine.

165
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
Yeah, what's up?

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,280
Better songs.

167
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Maybe the music.

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
Maybe none of the Marvel matters.

169
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
And it's just that we get a rock and roller coaster with songs that,

170
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,760
if you can imagine, are a little bit better than the music of Aerosmith.

171
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
Well, it depends.

172
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
The vibes are different.

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,960
It's a different vibe.

174
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,520
It's just different.

175
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
Let's not say better.

176
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
Let's just say different.

177
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,260
OK.

178
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
There was, I mean, some of this groundwork.

179
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,560
The reason it's not in Islands of Adventure, it wasn't until the mid to later 2000s

180
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,960
that they kind of revamped Guardians of the Galaxy, that they were brought back to prominence.

181
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,640
And a lot of the characters that ended up in the movie were in, like, the comic,

182
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,560
but they didn't have the fun soundtrack on it.

183
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,120
But there's no songs.

184
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
There's no fun songs.

185
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,440
And there is, I feel like, less of an aesthetic.

186
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,720
It's really all I care about.

187
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,920
I can't, I think this time, the second time going on it,

188
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,960
I paid less attention to the story than ever.

189
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,760
I sensed that a lot of people on the line were doing the same thing.

190
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,080
Well, that's another-

191
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,600
After all that, none of it mattered.

192
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
All it just, all it boils down to is that this is a very good excuse

193
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
and a very good construct for a very good ride to play very good music.

194
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,400
And that's what we're here to focus on and to talk about.

195
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,120
Yeah. Yeah, the people in the pre-show rushed to the door.

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,160
Yes, this is a new thing that we've noticed, yeah.

197
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,040
And boy, it felt like festival disaster type energy when people-

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Go, go, go, to the right, all the way to the right.

199
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
Got into that pre-show and ran to the place they knew would be the exit eventually.

200
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,680
I was like, oh, whoa.

201
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,840
I was like a little taken aback by how aggressive everyone was being in that room.

202
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,600
And they did not want to watch the rest of the pre-show.

203
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
They just were like, get us on the ride.

204
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,160
I do this a little bit when getting in the Haunted Mansion elevator.

205
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,320
I feel like I sort of know where the doors are.

206
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,720
You have to acquaint yourself in one of the two elevators to figure out where exactly.

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
And I messed it up in Florida.

208
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
That's something I found.

209
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
I didn't know where the door is in there.

210
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,400
I didn't know either.

211
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
I'm not acting like I'm an expert.

212
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,560
Okay, okay, a few.

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm not an expert.

214
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
But we did go in the Haunted Mansion and we did see the Hapox Ghost

215
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
before the Madame Leona scene.

216
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
We don't have time for that.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,360
Are you crazy?

218
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,920
It sucks.

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,640
It sucks shit.

220
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Anyway, let's keep going.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
It's further flushing out of why it sucks shit.

222
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
She doesn't call the ghosts and he's there.

223
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,760
It doesn't make sense.

224
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
I hit the microphone so bad.

225
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Anyway, go ahead.

226
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,600
Okay, what we are here to talk about is this is sort of a follow-up

227
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
of our recent whirlwind Orlando adventure.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
We talked about it on the main feed of this incredible opportunity

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
to check out Epic Universe early before.

230
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
A phenomenal experience.

231
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,520
Really cool to get to do.

232
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,520
But we did pack in a speed round of Disney World the day before.

233
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,400
And what this episode is is focusing on what I think we would both agree

234
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,320
is the singular best thing that occurred on that day.

235
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,040
I don't want to say-

236
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,400
Ride-wise for sure.

237
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,120
Yeah, yes.

238
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
I don't want to make it compete against things that happened at Epic Universe.

239
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
A lot of great stuff happened at Epic,

240
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
but a lot of great stuff happened during the day.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Yes, yeah.

242
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,880
You saw a hero of yours perform music that day.

243
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
Oh, that's right, yes.

244
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,800
So there's others.

245
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,080
Many things happened is all I'm saying.

246
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,480
Yes, yeah.

247
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Well, it was a great day for music and Epcot for sure.

248
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,800
But yeah, I mean, all told, I would call this an all-time great Disney World day.

249
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
I don't know if you would go so far as to agree.

250
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,080
It was for me.

251
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,800
For a day where I didn't have family there,

252
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,640
where significant others weren't there.

253
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,280
That's good.

254
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,000
I love that.

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah.

256
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
Day for the boys.

257
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
The boys can do it too.

258
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,120
We don't need kissing and smooching in order to make this an awesome day.

259
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,620
Oh, thanks.

260
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,520
No, yeah, boys' day, bachelor's day.

261
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,020
That's right.

262
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,160
I mean, it was just a wonderful, it was a really great time.

263
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,560
And I felt like luck was on our side in general, which I think factors into what was going on here.

264
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
And I guess this isn't luck.

265
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
Some of this is the generosity of a kind soul.

266
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,080
But I think a little bit of context to say here is that, yes, thanks to somebody's generosity,

267
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,640
we ended up with some fast passes.

268
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,140
Sure did.

269
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,720
Yes, we had a little bit of help, a little bit of a Disney bump,

270
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,640
a performance-enhancing drug that let us kind of do some stuff that we wanted to do.

271
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,480
And in having that at our disposal at Epcot Center,

272
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,600
you had precisely one plan of how you wanted to use these.

273
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
So would you like to say what your plan was?

274
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,360
Well, I just said, you know, I want to save fast passes just for Guardians.

275
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,680
And we had special, these were, we had, we could go on multiple times.

276
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
It wasn't, sometimes with a fast pass, you can only go on the ride once.

277
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,120
One ride per, yes.

278
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,200
But I was saying like, I want to do, my number one thing I want to do at a Disney World Day

279
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,600
is to get a certain song on Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind.

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,920
Yes.

281
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
Just because that felt like, well, that's going to be a unique thing.

282
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,440
Because we didn't do any other rides that I have never done before.

283
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,160
This just felt like the singular thing I needed to do.

284
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
And it's still new to us.

285
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,080
We only, we went on it once before.

286
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,640
Only once.

287
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,520
And so very excited about the ride, but really excited about the specific goal.

288
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,720
Let's talk about the song.

289
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,400
The song is of the six that are, and if you don't know, or just quick refresher,

290
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,840
I think everybody does, but much like Guardians Mission Breakout here in California,

291
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,360
there is a randomizer and you can get one of six songs that change your experience.

292
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
And these are all sort of from the 70s and 80s.

293
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,880
I guess some 60s in there, at least in the West Coast.

294
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:44,960
But you don't know what song you're getting until things kick in in a big, exciting way.

295
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,640
Here in California, it's when you first get shot up, kind of right before.

296
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,280
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,800
It plugs the Walkman in.

298
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
Does it click in at the, okay.

299
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
So it's a little bit before you first get shot.

300
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
And he gets things rocking and he clicks it and then it starts.

301
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
Oh yeah, it's still some like suspense music a little bit.

302
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,920
And similar here, you get the same opening every time in this sequence with Eson.

303
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,480
Yes.

304
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
What's the name?

305
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,400
The Celestial.

306
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,440
Yes, Eson.

307
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Yes.

308
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,440
And this moment, I don't know, I can't, I should have listened to the whole First

309
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
Guardians episode.

310
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,120
This, I can't overstate how much the moment you're talking about

311
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
is like an all-time great theme park moment.

312
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,360
Yeah, yes.

313
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,120
It really is the sort of moment, you remember the moment before when all,

314
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
like the big bang happens.

315
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
The big bang happens, yeah.

316
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,040
And it's silence and then you shoot back as the,

317
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
you figure out what song you're about to hear.

318
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,040
And it really, due to the nature of the big bang, all sound is sucked from the room.

319
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,840
That's what's so cool about it.

320
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,240
It's like exceptionally designed regardless of which song you end up getting.

321
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,960
And it just creates a perfect bed for whatever is going to kick in,

322
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,840
whether it be a raucous dance kind of song,

323
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,480
or in this case, something a little bit more emotional.

324
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
Quick reminder, some of the songs,

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Konga Gloria Estefan, Trance Disco Inferno,

326
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,200
which is what we got the first time, Disco Inferno,

327
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,160
Flock of Seagulls Ran So Far Away, One Way or Another,

328
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,080
Blondie, September, Earth, Wind and Fire.

329
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,800
But the song that you had the goal,

330
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,520
I think this was said before we even got down to Florida.

331
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh, I've been saying on the show for a long time, too.

332
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,640
There you go. Okay, okay.

333
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,800
Yes, I think I forgot this has been a runner on the-

334
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
I think I pegged it the first time when we did this episode.

335
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,760
Okay.

336
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,840
Because this is just, I've been, I've known,

337
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
I shouldn't say, because I'm tipping what we think about it already,

338
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
but I knew that's the one, that's the special one.

339
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
Not that I like all the, I really do like most of the songs.

340
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
Yes, yeah, yeah, I know.

341
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
I'd be happy to get any of them and I've been happy to get Konga before.

342
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,400
I just knew that was a little different.

343
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,960
I mean, I ran is a little different, too, but I haven't done it yet,

344
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,320
but I knew this one.

345
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
Yeah, yes, you called it a while back.

346
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,320
The song is Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears.

347
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,840
You had a feeling, you had a special feeling.

348
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,760
I've always been extremely fond of this song.

349
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,560
I love this song.

350
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah, yeah.

351
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,560
Seems like the same for you.

352
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah, it's more and more in my adult years, honestly,

353
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,120
because they used to play, I think they said this,

354
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
they used to play this when they would just show you the traffic report

355
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,040
or the weather on the look like the morning news

356
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,200
that I would watch before school every day for years.

357
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
And it just like played and it was sort of background music

358
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,880
and I didn't dislike it.

359
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,120
It just sort of, it didn't strike me as like,

360
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,200
oh, this song is really good until I was older.

361
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
It was in a boring like car commercial,

362
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,680
like that intro I sort of took for granted.

363
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,480
I think I maybe just thought of it as like same with the,

364
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
you know, the who song Eminence Front?

365
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,840
Yes, which is a cool song.

366
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
Yes, really cool song.

367
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
I maybe, we went down to that thing Desert Trip.

368
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
I think maybe I didn't know that that wasn't like a song

369
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,360
from a car commercial until they were playing it at that show.

370
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,760
And it was cool.

371
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
We got to see the who.

372
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,840
It was a cool version of it.

373
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
It was really cool.

374
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,720
Like I was really impressed with that.

375
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
I dug into that as soon as I could after.

376
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
I was admittedly ignorant of that song, but similar.

377
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
I think I just like, I know this music,

378
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,160
that's from a commercial or something.

379
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,480
Yeah.

380
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
Had not let it live with me as like incredible,

381
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
emotional, evocative piece of music.

382
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,080
It's so great.

383
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
I've been fond of it for a long time,

384
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,600
but I still hadn't really clocked that like,

385
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,760
oh, I would love to have that song be married to this ride.

386
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,440
I think it took you saying it as a goal

387
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,280
for me to start getting on board.

388
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,680
And even when you said I want to use these,

389
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,600
I want to just like try to go on this ride a couple of times

390
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
with this goal in mind.

391
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
I was like, huh, maybe.

392
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
Well, do I really want to go on it?

393
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
Am I capable of going on it a bunch?

394
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,560
This is a very dizzying ride, as we have found.

395
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,240
I was a little bit like,

396
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,720
I don't know if I could do this three times in a row,

397
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
although should we be so lucky?

398
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
It's like, I'd want to figure it out.

399
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
That is a great song.

400
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,640
I was just going to say, like my association with it,

401
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,200
round 18 or 19, it is in the Grand Theft Auto Vice City soundtrack.

402
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
There's a lot of great songs on that.

403
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

404
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
I mean, it's multiple.

405
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,120
The set of the full soundtrack at the time was like a number of discs

406
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,080
because each radio station had different songs.

407
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,520
So it was between six and eight discs.

408
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
So you've killed men to that song.

409
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
Oh, I've killed.

410
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
I've driven in, seen the sunset, the digital sunset.

411
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,280
I believe.

412
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,600
All right.

413
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
I looked it up and I am right.

414
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,560
Another song I'm really fond of, Call Me by Go West.

415
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,680
That is some evocative mid-80s, mid to late 80s angst.

416
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,800
Really love that song.

417
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
I think I didn't know it until...

418
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
I Ran So Far is in that.

419
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,320
I Ran So Far is, yeah.

420
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,720
Yeah.

421
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,220
Okay, okay.

422
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,400
The new one.

423
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,800
It's called I Ran.

424
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,560
It's called I Ran, yeah.

425
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,800
The new trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 has a Tom Petty song in it.

426
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,000
Love is a Long Road, which has got really great 80s synthesizers at the start of it.

427
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh, okay.

428
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,400
So there's those keeping...

429
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,840
You've probably heard it.

430
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,480
Because you're finally back in Vice City.

431
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
I think so.

432
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,320
I think that's what it is.

433
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,360
At least it's one of the cities in the game.

434
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,080
Anyway.

435
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,640
Oh, yeah.

436
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:10,960
Yeah.

437
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,960
With new technology, you can have multiple cities.

438
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,280
Sure.

439
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Bigger, bigger CPU.

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,240
Yeah.

441
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,360
Bigger cities.

442
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
They're getting pretty big, yeah.

443
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,120
They're pretty big.

444
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,080
Anyway, so I still like...

445
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
Though I love the song, I like your goal, but it was kind of like...

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
As the day went on, and it was a pleasant day in general,

447
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,040
where we were hopping around parks and having a great time.

448
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,560
Luck on our side, as we said.

449
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,440
Everything was just working out how we wanted it to.

450
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
Everything was hitting for us, and this was getting towards the end of the day.

451
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
And as you kept mentioning this goal, I started to get so on board with it.

452
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,160
I wanted it for you, and I started to want it for me.

453
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,640
I started to wonder, will I tap into the magic that Mike seems to be thinking he will feel

454
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
from this marriage of ride and song.

455
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,080
Look, we can keep building suspense or whatever, but I think we already said...

456
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,480
I puked.

457
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,200
...the deal.

458
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

459
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
And where it went was...

460
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,080
And the ride of Puked.

461
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,680
You puked so much that the ride had to be stopped midway through,

462
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,160
and everybody had to get off, and we didn't get to hear the whole song.

463
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah.

464
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,880
You puked during the launch, and thus we heard the intro, and that's all.

465
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
Right is the thing.

466
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,280
It's straight on.

467
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
Nah.

468
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,160
Like a chemtrail of puke.

469
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,320
Look, as we've learned, they've got water bottles and hand towels on standby.

470
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,280
There's benches and garbage cans.

471
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
It was also nice to get another shot at the ride.

472
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Obviously, we loved this ride very much.

473
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,200
From the get-go, it absolutely blew us away on a trip where a lot was new to us,

474
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,680
a lot of the last few years' worth of stuff.

475
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,880
And it still managed to live at possibly number one, although I know Velocicoaster's big for you.

476
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,800
Two chickens.

477
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
So for me, automatic advance to number one.

478
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
But there were some distractions going on when we did it before.

479
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,640
Yes, there was some sickness in our party right away, which happens.

480
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,840
And you understand why.

481
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,560
I think everybody leaves this thing at least a little bit dizzy.

482
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
A little dizzy, yeah.

483
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,340
Yes.

484
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,800
There was also the distraction of Mike's hat, the insistence that you keep the hat on despite

485
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,320
there being pretty obvious you should have taken the hat off.

486
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
I don't know if there was an insistence that I keep it on.

487
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,000
I think I just had really not even clocked that I needed to take it off.

488
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,560
I don't know why.

489
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
I don't think I would just think—

490
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
I feel like I take my hat off on the—

491
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,240
I usually do.

492
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,760
The train at Travel Town, the train that goes around in circles in Griffith Park here.

493
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,120
I said it was my fault to the guy who was rude to me as we got off.

494
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
I told the employee, like, ah, it's my fault.

495
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,560
I forgot to take the hat off or whatever.

496
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,160
And he's like, ugh, like he got really—

497
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
It was enough.

498
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,440
Yeah.

499
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
Admittance of fault isn't—

500
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,160
Yeah, he was just rude to me.

501
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Still a pain in his butt.

502
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,680
Whatever.

503
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,640
He didn't have to go look for—

504
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
I don't think he went to go look for it.

505
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,800
But they have to look every day.

506
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,240
We don't know, by the way—

507
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,880
Oh, no.

508
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,600
Okay, we do know—

509
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
You lost it on the very first moment, correct?

510
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,400
On the launch, yeah, yeah.

511
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
So that's a distraction right away.

512
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,840
Your first time going.

513
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,160
I was going to say it'd really be—

514
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,920
Maybe he was mad because the hat got blown on top of the globe at the end of the ride

515
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,120
and was just sitting perfectly—

516
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,560
I mean, that would be nice.

517
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,520
Which might be kind of cute.

518
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,160
It would be cute.

519
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,760
Great Easter egg.

520
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
Little Mickey hat on top of the globe.

521
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
I think it was on purpose.

522
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,220
Yeah.

523
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,840
But all of these a little bit of distractions the first time going.

524
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,400
Now, what was exciting the first time is that we got Conga, which was my goal.

525
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,640
For some reason, I was really feeling Conga.

526
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,320
Is it my favorite song in the list?

527
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,520
Not necessarily.

528
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,440
I just—something about—I don't know.

529
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
I just wanted that party.

530
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
That just seemed like a fun time, and it was.

531
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,680
I've never sensed that this is anybody's favorite song in the lineup of six.

533
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,180
Right.

534
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,740
But I—you don't always want the greatest necessarily.

535
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,780
You just—what I was in the mood for that day, it delivered for me.

536
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,740
But it did leave us—it was good because it left us wanting.

537
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,300
It left us—like, we feel like there's songs that could take this great ride

538
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,660
and really kick it into overdrive.

539
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,140
This was an incredible experience.

540
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:17,140
I can't begin to say how much—I don't even want—like we were saying about

541
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,580
the Lara Smith argument.

542
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,100
I don't even want to say better.

543
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,620
I just want to say different.

544
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:28,980
I want to say it was a different experience on levels that I was very surprised by

545
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:36,980
because it took what in Conga mode was just a big, raucous party of a ride,

546
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,700
and it turned it into just a highly emotionally charged experience.

547
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,100
Yeah.

548
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,380
It just—it was so moving to me.

549
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:54,820
It was less of a roller coaster and more of like a very active sound bath.

550
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,940
This was like deeply therapeutic.

551
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:06,100
It was a way to feel a song that you love on a whole other level that I—it was so

552
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,900
shocking to me.

553
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,700
So when it happened, I was excited that you got your goal.

554
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,980
Because we got a first try.

555
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,900
First try, we did it.

556
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,380
Okay, yes.

557
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,940
The big bang happens, it's quiet, and then when you're—that little part of it that

558
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,660
starts that song.

559
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,540
And I was like, whoa!

560
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,460
Because that's a, you know, what?

561
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,220
One in twenty—no, twenty.

562
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,780
That's not twenty.

563
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,340
One in six.

564
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,060
One in six, yeah.

565
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,500
But even—but there's other things.

566
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,620
There's other factors at work here.

567
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:41,460
I got curious about like, is there a way to game it and to try to time out what song you get?

568
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,300
And I mean, the short answer is no.

569
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,060
Technically, it is a loop.

570
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,180
I think they all do play in an order.

571
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:59,300
Like if each car is like, all right, now it's Iran and now it's Kong or whatever the order is.

572
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,580
But they also arrive at different loading platforms.

573
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:09,140
They, you know, you can't control delays or this one has to go through without people on it.

574
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:16,420
Like there's a ton of, you know, vehicles get pulled and put back on throughout the day.

575
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,900
So even if you went to a team member and said, hey, is there a way I could arrange Tears for Fears?

576
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,980
I don't think there is a way that they could do that.

577
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,540
Yeah.

578
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,060
So it makes it even more of a feat, more of a miracle.

579
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,620
It might be more than one in six, due to that reason.

580
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,500
Sound systems are also not perfect.

581
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,460
So I am sure there are people who have ridden and the sound is cut out.

582
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,980
That would be a startling ride for silence and just hear silence on screens.

583
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,860
Uh-huh.

584
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,460
That'll happen sometimes.

585
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,780
Yeah.

586
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,340
In Florida.

587
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,700
They just meet, oh, in Florida.

588
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,980
Oh, in Florida it just never has.

589
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,700
Yes, indeed.

590
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,020
Yeah.

591
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,780
You just get to hear that clunk.

592
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,420
The Christmas.

593
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,020
Oh, they do.

594
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,980
Yeah, that's awesome.

595
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,260
If it's not on board, they just run it through the whole room.

596
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,460
Yeah, I think that's what it is.

597
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,340
You can't have it only be on board on the car just for that.

598
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,220
But yeah, that's a part of building suspense, I guess I forgot,

599
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,260
is that it was a very lucky day for us.

600
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,860
And then finally.

601
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,860
And the ride broke down.

602
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,500
Yes, well, that's what we were starting to say.

603
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,300
Maybe our luck has run out because we were so close.

604
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,460
We were through, we were past the pre-show.

605
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,980
We were past the room where everybody just runs to the side now

606
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,460
to try to board the coaster quicker.

607
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,780
We had made it through there and we were in this kind of airlock tube kind of zone.

608
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,460
You're not on the loading platform yet.

609
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,620
You're up on the level above, but you can see cars coming in and out.

610
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,660
And we saw cars load and then we saw them not leave.

611
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,940
We saw them stuck there for a while.

612
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,060
And then the group disembarked entirely.

613
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,100
And there was a big, oh, that spread all the way back from the people closest to it

614
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,780
to us pretty far away.

615
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,580
And a grumble began and it started to feel like,

616
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,460
is this the time where we don't get on this thing?

617
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,100
I guess that's the end of the luck.

618
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,460
But we were patient.

619
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,420
We waited it out.

620
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,740
We believed in your goal enough.

621
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,340
And sure enough, it was only like a 10 minute think.

622
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,460
Yeah, it was not bad at all.

623
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,740
Yes, because we were going to bail.

624
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,660
We'd come back maybe at that point.

625
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,820
But yeah, we were going to bail and it happened.

626
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,780
But you think about it now, if we had bailed

627
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,980
or if it hadn't happened in that exact or if that car had not gone out then,

628
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,180
if they hadn't run empty cars through at that exact moment,

629
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,340
it was all conspiring to give us the song that we were after.

630
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,860
You know, it's fun to think about stuff like that,

631
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,460
but then you could also drive yourself insane.

632
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,780
You know, like if I didn't do this at this moment,

633
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,460
what would have happened to my life?

634
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,180
Oh, my God.

635
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,260
I think some things you think are regretful,

636
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,220
some things you're ecstatic that they happened in this way, you know?

637
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,220
And suddenly the guardians ride becomes a sliding doors ride.

638
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,780
That's right.

639
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,000
Exactly.

640
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,380
Maybe we're dead.

641
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,260
Who's sitting on that?

642
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,300
Ketchup Entertainment?

643
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,820
Can you use sliding doors ride?

644
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,220
Yeah, absolutely.

645
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,700
But it all worked out.

646
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,140
And I guess that's a couple of pieces to break off here.

647
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,740
With you having had this desire for months, for day, for that whole day,

648
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,820
when it happened, when the sound perfectly clears

649
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,180
and those magical ethereal opening notes begin,

650
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,780
because the song starts out on such a high note

651
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,140
and it has to, any song for this ride,

652
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,820
you really got to think about how difficult it must have been for them to narrow it down

653
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,020
and to get it to these six.

654
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,500
And they're all successful in this regard that it has to,

655
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,140
you have to know what it is from note one.

656
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,620
Oh, yeah.

657
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,900
There's a lot of great songs, a lot of classic songs anybody loves

658
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,220
where you don't necessarily know it from note one.

659
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,460
Right.

660
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,860
That is sort of the goal of any of these.

661
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,900
It has to be.

662
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,540
And it has to have a lot of sections and movements, which this obviously has.

663
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,180
And it kind of has to get to the point, too.

664
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,900
It can't be a song that just meanders and is cool for 45 seconds

665
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,860
and then the awesome part kicks in.

666
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,620
Yeah, you can't have that ramp up.

667
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,340
Yeah, yeah.

668
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:10,660
It's got to just go.

669
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,820
You can't have the long version of Prince's Erotic City.

670
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,780
You've got to have the three minute version, not the seven or eight minute version.

671
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,260
Although I'd say that's cooking from the gig.

672
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,660
It's funny.

673
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,860
I've been on a big Prince, not that I'm ever not on a Prince kick,

674
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,140
but especially, I was listening to the long one today.

675
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,940
Oh, I love the long one.

676
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,540
The long one's my choice.

677
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,940
Your cherry baby, that's, oh my God.

678
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,340
Yeah.

679
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,460
Yeah, the long one is more like the lead up to Billy Jean or something,

680
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,420
longer than Billy Jean, but all the parts get to come in

681
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,540
in their own little section or their own little showcase.

682
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,420
If you see it's the 12 inch mix or the extended whatever,

683
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,940
and you're getting this.

684
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,540
If you see seven minutes as the runtime on a Prince trick,

685
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,380
you're in good hands.

686
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,220
My dad once said, I don't like his songs.

687
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,180
They're too long.

688
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,740
I was like, how did you have me?

689
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,100
How are we related?

690
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,660
I could not feel more different on this point.

691
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,740
Yeah, I want 10 minutes.

692
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,980
I want north of it as long as they can go.

693
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,660
But anyway, so that just makes it, it's exciting musically from the get go,

694
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,260
but also just to hear those notes and go, oh my God, it's happening.

695
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,900
It happened.

696
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:21,540
I felt I felt such like brotherhood, kinship, pride.

697
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,740
I like I reached over and patted you on the back.

698
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,860
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

699
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,820
I was like, I have I feel the urge to give just like a loving arm around.

700
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,020
Like you did it.

701
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,620
Yeah, we did it.

702
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Something that I feel like I have not felt a thing like that with you

703
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,940
since you said we're having a baby.

704
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,340
We're not huggers here, particularly.

705
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,220
I wouldn't say much.

706
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,540
I don't mind it, but I'm not the one who ever initiated.

707
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,460
No, no, not really.

708
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,340
And in that moment, I was like, I got to give you a hug.

709
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,460
I can't not give you a hug.

710
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,980
Is that can I give you a hug?

711
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,220
And it felt like a sequel to that.

712
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,820
That's equally like I have not had the I must try.

713
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,660
I must touch Mike in this moment.

714
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,220
I didn't mind.

715
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,540
That's nice.

716
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,740
It felt it felt nice.

717
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,820
You know, we do these things day in, day out.

718
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,700
And it felt nice to have this magical moment.

719
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,780
Right on a ride on a specific ride.

720
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,140
Sorry you weren't there, Jason.

721
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,500
This is where I have to know.

722
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,220
Here we are.

723
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,260
Here I am going on.

724
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,140
And the brother, the kinship that we felt.

725
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,100
Two minds became one.

726
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,860
I'll take solace in that I was busy getting married.

727
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,020
Two became one on the ride and then two became one marriage.

728
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,260
Wow, yes.

729
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,020
Everlasting unions.

730
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,180
Yeah, the Spice Girls song was too big.

731
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,780
That's probably a sex song, right?

732
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,140
That two becomes one only for a 12 year old.

733
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,700
It's a sex.

734
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,540
The tamest sex.

735
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,580
Yeah, that might be like I never needed love before.

736
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,140
That's the song.

737
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,940
That's I'm going to make.

738
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,420
Yeah, they say I'm going to make love to you, baby.

739
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:04,980
That's the song.

740
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,820
As I said, it's a team song.

741
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,180
I'm not saying it's the dirtiest song.

742
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,780
It's a nice song.

743
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,100
More often, it probably got used for like two 13 year old

744
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,980
slop, like pecking on the school cafeteria dance floor.

745
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,900
Yeah, I'm sure they pecked.

746
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,180
Sloppy peck.

747
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,140
It's a 13 year old peck.

748
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,900
Sloppy peck because they're nasty.

749
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,940
13 year olds.

750
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,980
They are.

751
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,780
They are not looking forward to having them in my house.

752
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,280
Yeah.

753
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,900
Well, this is great.

754
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,620
You got on the first try and then I bet you ran through

755
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,820
the other fast passes on living with the land.

756
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,220
Because what's more exciting than hydroponics?

757
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,780
And seeing a sign that says okra.

758
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,220
Seeing a guy with a lap car put his clipboard in a desk drawer

759
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,780
and then go up 530.

760
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,660
Time to get home.

761
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,660
And seeing a bunch of dust between two tanks.

762
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,740
We got to do the seeds tour next time we're there.

763
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,740
I think we should.

764
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,580
Behind the seeds tour.

765
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,260
You're trying to bring me down from this high.

766
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:08,980
No, I know you're high.

767
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,220
As quickly as you're trying to yank me back down.

768
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,980
It's funny you're saying all this too because I remember

769
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,100
thinking, oh no, Scott's more excited than I am.

770
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,980
Like I almost felt like I was betraying the moment

771
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,660
because you felt more excited.

772
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,860
Like you were more, you were exhibiting it more than I was.

773
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,980
Not that I wasn't excited.

774
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,700
I was very excited.

775
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,180
But then I was like, oh, I know, I almost like I want to enjoy

776
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,780
but I almost like I felt insecure.

777
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,740
I want to match, trying to match as well.

778
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,860
So I'm glad you felt that.

779
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,740
I appreciate you saying that.

780
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,340
I didn't feel any lack of it from you.

781
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,900
Okay, good, good.

782
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,060
Maybe sometimes, maybe your passion can become

783
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,260
kind of a transitive quality sometimes because

784
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,420
I think I definitely ended up more enthusiastic

785
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,700
about Avatar than you.

786
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,100
For many years, you were the Avatar Torchbearer.

787
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,980
That's true, yes.

788
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,100
A very viable title for a future film, The Torchbearer.

789
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,660
Can I?

790
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,100
Avatar 7, The Torchbearer.

791
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,420
Now would you admit now, and again,

792
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,780
now that all this good will's here,

793
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,940
maybe I shouldn't put you on the spot like this,

794
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,460
but Jason Sheridan called me something a couple weeks ago

795
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,740
in here that you didn't see.

796
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,020
Oh, I was just thinking about it, yeah.

797
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,780
He called me a tastemaker.

798
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,540
Oh, okay, I was like, oh, I hope I called it something nice.

799
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,380
He called me a dirty son of a bitch.

800
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,660
He called him a bleep.

801
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,820
No, that's the, I don't, people should not use that term

802
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,420
and need to stay engaged.

803
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,820
Jason did look scared like he said something mean about me

804
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,180
and I was like, oh.

805
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,900
I was like, what would I have said a few weeks ago?

806
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,020
He said something so kind.

807
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,660
I did.

808
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,820
He said he's called Mike the tastemaker.

809
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,340
Mike and his tastemaker role.

810
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,580
I will, okay, can I tell a funny story about this

811
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,780
that I think is, I think I know what happened

812
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,780
and I think I confused a couple people.

813
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,340
So Jason called me tastemaker a couple weeks ago.

814
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,300
Anyway.

815
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,060
So this was in Bar Rescue with Griffin.

816
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,100
Griffin Newman, yes.

817
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,060
But, so very quickly after that, I went

818
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,020
and I talk about this sometimes.

819
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,060
I go to the smokehouse to see Jimmy Angel,

820
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,900
89 year old rock and roll singer.

821
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,700
And I'm standing in the back with my parents

822
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,500
who are there with me.

823
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,220
This guy, the ultimate tastemaker.

824
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,260
He gets his parents in.

825
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,060
With my parents.

826
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Oh, he's got his elbows on its table

827
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,300
eating a New York strip with his hands.

828
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,860
My dad likes Jimmy Angel maybe more than I do even.

829
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,460
Loves Jimmy Angel.

830
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,820
Generationally, that makes sense.

831
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,180
Probably correct that he should.

832
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,860
Like my dad is still like 30 years.

833
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,500
He's still not the generation of Jimmy Angel.

834
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,300
Yeah, Jimmy's 89.

835
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,060
So two people stand up from their table.

836
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,500
They're leaving the done eating.

837
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,220
They walk over to me and the gentleman says to me,

838
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,500
we're here because of you.

839
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,340
Wow, wow.

840
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,660
And I get so excited, obviously.

841
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,540
I go, oh, really?

842
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,660
Wow, that's great.

843
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,460
And here's the mistake I think I made.

844
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,780
And I think I confused the shit out of these two people.

845
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,700
I had mentioned Jimmy Angel on Doughboys recently.

846
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,060
That was the most recent.

847
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,540
And I believe they're Doughboys listeners,

848
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,140
not podcasts, they're ride listeners.

849
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,180
So what I said to two people who I was thinking

850
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,420
podcasts or other centers, I said,

851
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,820
I am a taste maker like Jason said.

852
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,180
They looked at me like they had no clue what I was saying.

853
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,220
They smiled and were polite and nodded.

854
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,260
And they said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,980
Oh, great.

856
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,660
We just met another Hollywood weirdo.

857
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,500
And they go, oh, yeah, so then whatever.

858
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,380
We said something and they left.

859
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,180
They think Jason is your mean stepdad.

860
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,300
It's possible, yes.

861
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,140
Let's see, I'll show that Jason.

862
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,860
I was just like talking.

863
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,980
People do like me.

864
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,140
I am going to make stuff out of myself.

865
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,260
I will kiss a girl.

866
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,760
Yeah.

867
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,820
So then they left and I took a second and I went,

868
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,820
I think I know these are Doughboys fans

869
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,420
that recognized me, not podcasts, the ride listeners.

870
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,980
So I think I confused the hell out of them.

871
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,260
But I did.

872
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,580
So that's a little bit of me looking like a fool.

873
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,380
But also I am a taste maker in this situation as well.

874
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,220
They came, they said they loved it.

875
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,260
They had such a good time.

876
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,740
This, can I tell a story?

877
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
Can I tell an embarrassing story of this nature?

878
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,540
Sure, yeah.

879
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Because of just not understanding the moment,

880
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,580
assumed some podcast listenership that was not there.

881
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,060
So I went to a children's birthday party and-

882
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,020
I like how this is starting.

883
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,660
And I walked in and I was on the earlier end

884
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,580
and there were only a couple of people there.

885
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,380
And I was introduced to somebody who said,

886
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,340
oh, you just went to Bass Pro Shops.

887
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,060
Or asked a question, did you just go to Bass Pro Shops?

888
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,380
And I was like, how do you know that?

889
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,340
And I said, oh, do you listen to the podcast?

890
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,940
And she's like, what?

891
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,500
And I was like, oh, and then I looked down at my son

892
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,660
and he was wearing a Bass Pro Shops hat.

893
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,820
Then I remembered myself and the top of my own head,

894
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,100
which was also clad in a Bass Pro Shops hat.

895
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,820
This was being said because two people,

896
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,660
had man and child, had both walked in saying,

897
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,460
both walked in wearing Bass Pro Shops hats.

898
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,580
This was made slightly more embarrassing by the fact

899
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,620
that this was the first time that I was meeting somebody

900
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,020
who I am a fan and admirer of,

901
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,300
the great actress, Kristen Schaal.

902
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,260
Really?

903
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,740
I'm a little thrown because I didn't think

904
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,100
she would be at this thing.

905
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,380
I like her very much.

906
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,060
I'm a big fan of hers.

907
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,860
I immediately put my foot in my mouth and say,

908
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,580
the only way you could be saying this is that somehow,

909
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,220
you know, you'd have to be a second gate subscriber

910
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,020
to know that.

911
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,900
Right, right, right.

912
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,020
But I truly, it was not, but other people there thought,

913
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,300
were like, you think she listens to the podcast?

914
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,580
I was like, no, that's not what I think.

915
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,620
That's not what I think.

916
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,300
I forgot that I was wearing the hats.

917
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,540
That's why it was not an ego thing.

918
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,180
It is fine.

919
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,980
I am perfectly calm and collected here.

920
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,780
This is fine.

921
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,340
You got to do the finger thing for that.

922
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,220
If she didn't do the finger, like point down pointing,

923
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,780
you got to do like, oh, you guys just went to Bass Pro.

924
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,700
So you're blaming her for not.

925
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,620
I'm saying if she didn't, you know,

926
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,020
I could see that you could get confused

927
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,940
and you were meeting someone you admired.

928
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,620
And isn't that the worst thing?

929
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,780
That's what you don't want to happen.

930
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,980
That would sit with me for a while.

931
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,860
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,420
No, I knew I could not keep that in my brain.

933
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,100
Now you, the listener, knows this as well.

934
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,620
That, the story I just sat with me for like a week or two

935
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,980
of like, oh God.

936
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,060
And then I forgot even there's another extra part

937
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,260
is the woman, I guess I'm assuming probably a wife,

938
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,380
asks the guy, she goes, oh, you want to photo with him?

939
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,340
And he goes, no, I'm all right.

940
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,260
Nice.

941
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,300
Which is always the funniest, which I like, you know,

942
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,620
you don't have to take a picture.

943
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,900
But they knew who you were.

944
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,420
They did know what you looked like.

945
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,740
Oh, it was a video.

946
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,460
And in just a week or two, I was on a double

947
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,660
and there's a nice chunk about Jimmy Angel on the episode.

948
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,620
So I maybe, look, if they're listening now

949
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,060
and I'm incorrect, let me know.

950
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,060
But I'm 99% positive that they were Doughboy's people

951
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,740
that did not know that Jason Sheridan

952
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,380
called me a tastemaker weeks prior.

953
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,260
And I said it enthusiastically as if,

954
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,860
I am a tastemaker.

955
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,820
These must be listeners.

956
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,860
Something they don't know.

957
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,060
Like Jason said, something deeper they don't know.

958
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,780
Yeah, yeah.

959
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,820
Oh, incredible.

960
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,340
Well, when I do other shows, I say,

961
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,140
I host a show, Scott and Mike, you know,

962
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,380
I always say everyone's names, you know,

963
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,580
just in case someone was hearing me for the first time.

964
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,460
So I don't know.

965
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,060
I don't know if that would have even rectified.

966
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,580
No, I didn't know what was, I didn't,

967
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,700
I don't think I figured out what was going on

968
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,540
until they were gone is what I'm saying.

969
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,580
I didn't put two and two together just because I was like,

970
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,380
oh, I bet, I bet they're Doughboy's people.

971
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,540
Cause I forgot I had just, that Doughboy's episode

972
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,660
had just come out with a chunk about Jimmy.

973
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,500
You were out of your steak case.

974
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,220
You were grumbling, eating your cream spinach

975
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,420
cause you're like, I don't like it,

976
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,700
but I know it's good for me.

977
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,860
I like cream spinach.

978
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,300
I didn't understand that last part.

979
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,060
Are you saying the smokehouse menu

980
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,140
with the cream spinach are you talking about?

981
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,180
Well, I was just assuming that's a common steakhouse side.

982
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,980
So I was like-

983
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,860
It is what we're talking about.

984
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,340
Maybe you know if you went to a place that served,

985
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,260
I don't know, a combo of items

986
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,380
I know what you feel about steak houses.

987
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,260
So I've been trying to get you out to Jimmy for a while.

988
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,700
And you've been saying it's one reason,

989
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,140
but maybe now it's because it's a steakhouse.

990
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,780
Is that why?

991
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,980
Do you have a problem with steak houses?

992
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,900
No, I don't have a problem with steak houses.

993
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,740
I don't eat steak that often.

994
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,220
Sure.

995
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,780
Yeah.

996
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,620
So if a place has steak, that's fine.

997
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:25,940
Yeah.

998
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,860
And if a place has bourbon, that's fine.

999
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,340
Yeah.

1000
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,900
But combined.

1001
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,580
I just thought it was a little like a kind of bland,

1002
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,540
So you can have the things.

1003
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,900
Bland but aggressive advertising.

1004
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,820
But if the smokehouse changed its name

1005
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,660
to The Steak and Bourbon House overnight,

1006
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,500
they would become a bad organization?

1007
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Well, it's a historic landmark.

1008
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,380
They shouldn't change it.

1009
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,900
Well, we can agree on that.

1010
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,460
Yeah.

1011
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,100
No, they should not fuck with the formula.

1012
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,980
Hypothetically.

1013
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,020
OK, let's talk about this a lot.

1014
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,980
So the victory of kicking in was tremendous.

1015
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,820
It was nice to have this moment of brotherhood.

1016
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:06,340
Beyond that, it's just such a great sequence of ride

1017
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,780
combined with music.

1018
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,460
Obviously, you've got to do a cut down.

1019
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,300
You've got to chop it up a little bit.

1020
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,020
And I think they did it in a masterful way

1021
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,580
where it doesn't feel like a radio edit

1022
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,660
or you're missing anything too important.

1023
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,140
Obviously, that's a pretty long song.

1024
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,420
And it's got two, I think, remarkable solos.

1025
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,140
And you don't have time for all of those

1026
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,540
in a ride version.

1027
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,020
Yeah.

1028
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,660
But the cut down really does get you

1029
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,860
a lot of the diversity of the song.

1030
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,740
You know, it gets you verses and choruses

1031
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,100
and bridge and solo.

1032
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,660
Maybe you don't get, there's probably no bridge.

1033
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,500
You don't get the, there's a room where the.

1034
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,140
There's a room with hands right there.

1035
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,660
I don't think so.

1036
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,380
Maybe towards the end, maybe you.

1037
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,980
It's also hard to watch on YouTube.

1038
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,820
This is another part of me hyping it up.

1039
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,820
It's hard to tell on YouTube

1040
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,660
because it's just so hard to capture the audio

1041
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,700
in a clear way when you're watching a YouTube

1042
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,740
ride through of.

1043
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,420
This is some of what has haunted me

1044
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,980
about this attraction is that there are some.

1045
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,060
There's some attractions, you know,

1046
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,940
like I found myself watching Rise of the Resistance

1047
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,020
a lot during pandemic, knowing that we were

1048
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,500
really far away from being able to go on that thing again.

1049
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,900
Yeah.

1050
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,620
And there's videos that capture it pretty decently

1051
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,060
and that at least give you like, wow,

1052
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,660
when those cannons go back and forth,

1053
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,580
that is so stark and scary,

1054
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,340
even if I'm not there in the room.

1055
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,260
This is impossible to watch a video of.

1056
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
Yeah, you really don't know,

1057
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,420
but you have to be like an expert photographer,

1058
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,700
I think, to get the like the balance right,

1059
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,300
to get the exposure right.

1060
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,940
That room with the celestial where you do the big turn

1061
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,660
and where everybody flips and the whole ride vehicle

1062
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,660
becomes inverted and you're in the front.

1063
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,340
Now you're in the back and vice versa.

1064
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,620
That room looks like shit in any video that you watch.

1065
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,020
Yeah.

1066
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,540
You might watch it and think,

1067
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,060
hey, Disney really cheaped out.

1068
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,700
Yeah.

1069
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,020
And in person, it's unbelievable.

1070
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,620
It's just impossible that, you know,

1071
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,460
like Space Mountain is never really going to translate,

1072
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,740
although I think it's worse.

1073
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,620
I think Space Mountain,

1074
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,140
it is maybe understand better in a video than Guardians.

1075
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,340
It really doesn't come through.

1076
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,980
Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,300
The mix of, yeah, the mix of the lighting

1078
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,020
and just how fast in different directions is just,

1079
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,460
it's impossible.

1080
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,420
I wonder if they even have a good ride through themselves

1081
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,660
because like they put out Tiana's like,

1082
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,860
they'll now put out videos to get ahead of people

1083
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,060
doing it during.

1084
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,340
Oh, yeah, which I love.

1085
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,940
It's nice to like see a really polished,

1086
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,220
like a well shot ride.

1087
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,980
Yeah, I think it's also to prevent like universal.

1088
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,540
A lot of it, you have to empty your pockets

1089
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
and leave your bags in a locker.

1090
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:37,940
Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:43,300
So I think like them strapping in a camera is safer.

1092
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,780
Well, that's true.

1093
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,180
And more reliable.

1094
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,180
Don't film it where we have one.

1095
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,820
And you can make the ad revenue from that too.

1096
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,500
There's a lot of people who probably make like really

1097
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,980
like a load up ad revenue wise just by like filming a ride.

1098
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,980
And becoming the main way to watch the ride.

1099
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,300
Yeah, there's a great Velocicoaster on ride

1100
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,540
from universal that I watch a lot.

1101
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,580
That one's really good.

1102
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,820
It's really good and really gives you a feeling of it.

1103
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,220
It might be the only way I experienced it.

1104
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,780
I don't know.

1105
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,260
We'll see.

1106
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,460
I watched some epic leaks.

1107
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,820
So I couldn't help it.

1108
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,380
Well, no, I also, it's like the first opening summer of a party.

1109
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,740
You never know what you're actually

1110
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,220
going to be able to get done and get on.

1111
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,740
There's no way I'm doing it for the big ones we missed

1112
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,780
for Ministry of Magic.

1113
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,460
And what's that?

1114
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:29,940
Is that right?

1115
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,860
Actually, is it called Fight for the Ministry?

1116
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,740
Is that the name of that?

1117
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,940
Battle of the Battle.

1118
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,860
Yeah, OK, I'm going to do it.

1119
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,580
Well, Jane sent me a leak monster ride.

1120
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,460
And I said, no spoilers.

1121
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:39,940
Oh, yeah, me too.

1122
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,140
I did not click on it.

1123
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,340
Well, and then later that day, that's only like can't fit.

1124
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,780
Later that day, the full one.

1125
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,820
Did you watch all of it?

1126
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,780
Yeah.

1127
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,580
Don't say a word.

1128
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,700
Don't you dare say a word.

1129
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,220
But there's a lot of darkness.

1130
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,700
Sure.

1131
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,340
Because it's scary monsters.

1132
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,140
So you're not able to communicate similarly.

1133
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,740
Well, I guess it's a spoiler in that now I

1134
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,340
know that the monsters aren't all in a meadow by a rainbow.

1135
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,220
That's true.

1136
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,100
I know that it's not about the monsters going to a park.

1137
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,300
You were hoping there was like a Pride and Prejudice,

1138
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,940
like kind of like a guy crossing a long field.

1139
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,140
Oh, yeah, maybe just a little shoot.

1140
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,140
Like Frankenstein's Zeo-ly lumbering.

1141
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,140
Sound of music, but it's with the Wolfman instead.

1142
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,100
Yeah.

1143
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,980
All right, well, spoiler, the ride has darkness in it.

1144
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,780
It's dark.

1145
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,500
Got it.

1146
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,460
I did see the first glow.

1147
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,660
I saw somebody playing it.

1148
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,620
OK, I haven't done it.

1149
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,180
I haven't done it.

1150
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,820
I don't want it.

1151
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,620
I don't want it.

1152
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,420
We're going back.

1153
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:32,980
We're doing it.

1154
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,380
We're done.

1155
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:33,860
We're done.

1156
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,220
Yeah.

1157
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,940
But OK, where does this take us?

1158
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,340
I mean, everything's like remarkably paired.

1159
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,740
It works so well.

1160
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,900
Then immediately, the emotion of it is clear.

1161
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,540
I start having something come over me, which I was surprised

1162
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,260
by is that it starts to feel like a concert to me.

1163
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,100
And I have the urge to sing along with it.

1164
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,660
I can't say that I've done that on any of these

1165
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
or on any other ride that plays a song.

1166
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,180
A roller coaster, your inclination

1167
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,700
is not to sing along.

1168
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,060
But it was hitting so hard, I could not help but do it.

1169
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,100
And it felt great.

1170
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,860
I'm trying to think of I like to sing Monsters After Dark

1171
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,820
on the monster.

1172
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,380
Sure.

1173
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,100
Overlay.

1174
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,740
Yeah.

1175
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,180
Monsters After Dark.

1176
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:16,740
I like that.

1177
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,180
Yeah, I don't know.

1178
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,300
Other than that, I guess on Rock and Roller Coaster,

1179
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,580
I don't usually sing along.

1180
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,700
Although when we go for the last time, I will.

1181
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,420
Oh, that's right.

1182
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,980
Oh, right.

1183
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,420
And how many Aerosmith songs are on Rock and Roller Coaster?

1184
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,060
I should know this.

1185
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,780
I'm not the person.

1186
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,100
There are only two.

1187
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,260
It mostly clips, isn't it?

1188
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,620
There's like, yeah, they just change.

1189
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,260
Quick hits.

1190
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,740
Yeah, but is it the same loop every time?

1191
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,220
I don't really.

1192
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,100
I feel like it's not.

1193
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,660
I don't know.

1194
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,580
I'm going to try to get all of it next time.

1195
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,860
OK, walk this way.

1196
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,820
Dude looks like a lady.

1197
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,460
Sweet emotion.

1198
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,660
And back in the saddle.

1199
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,460
And then love in a roller coaster.

1200
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,260
And that's at the end.

1201
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,700
Yeah, that's always at the end.

1202
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,420
Is that all of them?

1203
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,620
Yeah, something called Young Lust.

1204
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,060
F-I-N-E spelled out.

1205
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,260
Those are in the ride?

1206
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,340
Yeah, Young Lust goes right into Fine.

1207
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,220
I don't care for this.

1208
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,100
I don't care for this one.

1209
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,700
But I'm glad they're getting this.

1210
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,260
The song Pink plays outside the ride.

1211
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,020
It's insane.

1212
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,460
It is insane.

1213
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,260
As long as I keep that and a Muppet sings it, it'll be fine.

1214
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,740
Sure.

1215
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,340
One of the Muppets sings the song Pink.

1216
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,500
A number of them are pink.

1217
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,540
The Muppets are pink.

1218
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:33,540
Mike, you don't ever walk down Main Street USA and find yourself singing Bicycle Bill for Two?

1219
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,060
Not all of us have the old cheap music.

1220
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,580
If Bicycle Bill for Two starts and I'm walking and you're there with me,

1221
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,060
I'll pat you on the back like Scott did to me and I'll get so excited for you and then

1222
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,940
we'll sing it together.

1223
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,220
Is that your favorite of the Main Street songs?

1224
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,060
Bicycle Bill for Two?

1225
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,500
Is there a song from Hello Dolly?

1226
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,140
Long Way to Tipperary.

1227
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,220
Well, I like Long Way to Tipperary.

1228
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,700
Sure.

1229
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,020
There's the song for, yeah, build your ultimate.

1230
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,740
What's your ultimate pairing of Main Street and Old Tiny Song?

1231
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,180
I do like the song from Hello Dolly.

1232
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,380
I don't know the name, but it's the same.

1233
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,540
It's the same that's in WALL-E.

1234
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,220
I forget the name of it too.

1236
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,180
The 60s Hello Dolly.

1237
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,620
There's Married Life from Up.

1238
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's a nice little thing that fits.

1239
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,100
That's one of those where like, I wonder if I heard that song on Main Street like

1240
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,260
seven times before I went, oh, this is from Up.

1241
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,020
Put on your Sunday clothes.

1242
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,540
Your Sunday clothes is from Hello Dolly and they play the instrumental.

1243
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,260
Okay, okay.

1244
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,980
We got to get you, you got to put a Main Street playlist together too, I think.

1245
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,940
DJ, oh, Jason's DJing again at a club in Orlando.

1246
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,580
You know it's all going to be this old timey bullshit.

1247
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,100
Long way to Tipperary.

1248
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,900
Oh, he put on the Caldo Adventure again.

1249
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,100
Has Pitbull ever sampled Long Way to Tipperary?

1250
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,260
He really should if he hasn't.

1251
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,780
I don't know.

1252
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,020
I don't know.

1253
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,300
Run out of samples.

1254
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,780
Wells Fargo Wagon is a song they play, it seems like.

1255
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,900
That's Music Man.

1256
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,780
That's Music Man.

1257
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,540
Daisy, is that like Daisy, Give Me Your Answer Do?

1258
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,740
Daisy, Daisy, yeah, yeah.

1259
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,700
Okay, all right.

1260
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,940
Well, stuff to explore there.

1261
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,100
More about the music loops, area loops coming up in the future, I think.

1262
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,060
But so, really hidden.

1263
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,420
It was like a concert, you said.

1264
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,860
Yes, really hidden at the chorus.

1265
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,700
And then, and around that time, I had a revelation.

1266
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,660
This is like, this is like a, this feels like being in the song.

1267
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,220
And not just like Congo was probably that too, but I just don't care about Congo.

1268
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,540
If you look at the list, if you look at the list of like these six in Mission Breakout

1269
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,420
and these six in Cosmic Rewind, I would say everybody wants to rule the world is the only

1270
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,980
one that is like emotional.

1271
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,580
Maybe some of these songs are, but they're all more like upbeat rockers, right?

1272
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,460
Which this is too, which is what makes it perfect.

1273
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,460
It's like, it's like highly energetic.

1274
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,660
But I think it's the only one of the list, anyone correct me if I'm wrong,

1275
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,460
that you might feel like a lot of emotion.

1276
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,700
It's like the saddest, it's not really a sad song, but it's like a bittersweet song.

1277
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,900
It's a heavy song while also being upbeat.

1278
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,980
Iran is a little moodier too.

1279
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,260
I guess so.

1280
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,540
But not as, yeah.

1281
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,980
But everything else is pretty much a party song, I would say to some degree.

1282
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,140
Yes, and this could be too.

1283
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,620
That's what I think is what makes it a perfect choice.

1284
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,980
The fact that it has the emotional weight and that it's a song I've listened to and

1285
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:38,900
really felt a lot before, I was just like, oh my God, you know what's happening?

1286
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,580
This is what Sphere must be like for people.

1287
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:51,460
The highest caliber of technology is allowing me to experience this music that I care about

1288
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,940
in this ultimate sensory way.

1289
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,100
And I still have not been to Sphere.

1290
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,660
I still haven't found the right candidate of a Sphere show that I think is going to make me

1291
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,260
really feel it and live it.

1292
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,580
Wizard of Oz coming soon.

1293
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:13,700
Maybe this remix, they're doing a cut down of Wizard of Oz that is

1294
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,100
formatted specifically for Sphere.

1295
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,820
And then another movie that they announced, Backstreet Boys are coming.

1296
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,340
Eagles are staying always.

1297
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,020
And The Dead seems like they're staying too.

1298
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,540
I think they're just there forever.

1299
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,380
The Dead is just going to be hanging around for a while.

1300
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,900
I mean, clearly this thing is having a Drew Carey effect on everybody for sure.

1301
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,940
And now I'm just like, oh, I see what, I just don't have the connection to those

1302
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,700
U2 songs that you have, but it must be, it's got to be a similar thing, right?

1303
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,820
Just like, I can't believe technology and the might of man that allows me,

1304
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,940
this song has been around and I've been able to listen to it for 40 years,

1305
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,140
but never like this.

1306
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,900
I've never been able to experience it like this.

1307
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:00,660
You've never gone inside the song, which is what it felt like and what Sphere feels like.

1308
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,980
That's like, that's what I want.

1309
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:12,900
And maybe this ties into just my love of Jelly Rolls and cover, like cover bands.

1310
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,540
Go on.

1311
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:19,860
Is that I think that like, I am, I am on a constant search to immerse myself in a song.

1312
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,940
I'm not saying this even is in a jokey way.

1313
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:27,300
I do think I'm always like, I want to just feel one with the song.

1314
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,340
And I described this when I went to LCD sound system last year,

1315
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,380
and I hadn't been to a concert in forever, that I was alone.

1316
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,060
I had a half of a drink in me.

1317
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,740
Dad is in the back.

1318
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,380
It's got half a beer.

1319
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,340
I wasn't dancing.

1320
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,620
I was just kind of moving and I was just like, I'm like, I'm in it.

1321
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,340
I'm in it.

1322
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,540
I want to be in it.

1323
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,460
And I'm always, it doesn't matter.

1324
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,420
I mean, it does matter.

1325
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,060
Obviously that's a stronger experience.

1326
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,180
This is a stronger experience.

1327
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:50,980
Sphere is a stronger experience.

1328
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,180
Than Jelly Rolls, you're saying?

1329
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,140
Than Jelly Rolls.

1330
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,380
But I do think it's like-

1331
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,060
Than hearing two guys on pianos cover, Lose Yourself.

1332
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,340
Yeah, that was my favorite.

1333
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,100
Ironically, it didn't make you lose yourself.

1334
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,060
It didn't make you lose yourself.

1335
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,780
Although I saw another person at Disney Springs covering Lose Yourself.

1336
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,340
So I don't know what's in the air with Lose Yourself lately.

1337
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,860
It's been like over 20 years.

1338
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,260
One week.

1339
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,780
Oh, I was going to say it's been over 20 years since it came out.

1340
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,300
So it's like an anniversary maybe.

1341
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,500
It's an oldie.

1342
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,340
Yeah, it's a classic now.

1343
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,740
But I believe if I recall my Oscars history, it was not performed that year

1344
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,500
because he didn't want to perform it.

1345
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
It was like that's a weird song to try to cover.

1346
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:35,140
That would have been calamitous for someone else to do Lose Yourself.

1347
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,540
But Orlando performers are willing to do it anytime.

1348
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:46,260
Look, that is literally another episode of what works and what doesn't in a piano bar.

1349
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:52,660
But all that to say is just I'm searching for different ways to have these experiences.

1350
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,300
And this one did it in a new way.

1351
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,780
This ride mixed with a song.

1352
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,780
And it is because it's a different energy than just a party song,

1353
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,420
which it's fun to be on the roller coaster with a party song.

1354
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,780
But just the smooth, especially the smooth movements of this new technology

1355
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,740
with this type of vibe.

1356
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,060
Yeah.

1357
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,220
And it really did live up to what I thought, where it was like you can feel like

1358
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,060
you can feel floaty.

1359
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:23,780
You can feel like you're drifting on the same movements felt different.

1360
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,700
They felt more peaceful to me.

1361
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,100
Right.

1362
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,860
I felt such calm.

1363
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:33,140
It felt so meditative, even though it's the same thing that where the last time

1364
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,940
it was like I felt a little nauseous and I was yelling so much.

1365
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,300
I blew my voice out.

1366
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,940
This was just pure tranquility.

1367
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,700
I couldn't believe this music choice made it such a different experience.

1368
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,060
It's like Joker and Dark Knight head out the window kind of a vibe

1369
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,620
of just like that's what you're looking like.

1370
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,740
He's so he's so peaceful.

1371
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,940
Joker so peaceful in that moment.

1372
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,580
You can finally have the peace that Joker feels.

1373
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,620
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

1374
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:00,100
Finally, no one had considered sticking their head out of car window before that moment.

1375
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,780
He just looks so nice.

1376
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,620
He's not a thing that dogs do every day.

1377
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,820
Dogs love it, too.

1378
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,620
They do love it.

1379
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,860
But yeah, it is it was like if somebody somebody could have lied to me and said,

1380
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,620
oh, you know, if you really like the the ride itself is mimicking

1381
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,060
like a piece of like the music chart of the notes.

1382
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,980
And like, yes, we analyze.

1383
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,540
Yes, we created a path based on the way the notes

1384
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,500
move through the lied to me and said that that was actually

1385
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,220
if you took a look at actually the map of the ride itself,

1386
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,980
it's actually bouncing up and down the scale.

1387
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,940
It's it fit.

1388
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,820
Yeah, close.

1389
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,940
That's what I'm saying.

1390
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,620
Yeah, you could completely tell me that.

1391
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:43,460
The other thing that I think makes it fit so well is thematically like just like yes,

1392
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,340
the lyrics, which I won't pretend to know exactly what are going on.

1393
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,460
I think you could like apply them to anything, but I think they've they've spoke.

1394
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:55,860
Spoken of it being, you know, like a Cold War era influence, a Reagan influenced song.

1395
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:00,500
And I think you could apply it to, you know, to world events and scary stuff to this day,

1396
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,620
to current times.

1397
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,100
Yes.

1398
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,460
But you could also apply it to Eason.

1399
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,700
The scary alien bad guy, Celestial.

1400
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,740
But he's not he's not a Celestial, which is who lives it.

1401
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,260
Those are the inhabitants.

1402
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,140
Those are not Celestial.

1403
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,380
They live in Celestial Park.

1404
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,220
Celestials don't live at Celestial Park.

1405
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,980
They live at Guardians Cosmic Rewind.

1406
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,300
Yes.

1407
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,820
But in a similar way, it's like, yeah, it's if you take it very literally thematically,

1408
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,300
it's a big scary alien bad guy.

1409
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,460
He wants to rule the world.

1410
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:37,060
And similarly, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, it is an open world game.

1411
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:45,220
And you are trying to break up breaking money and take over stuff and rule the town.

1412
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,860
So it sees it sees it back for for your ends.

1413
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,260
Yeah.

1414
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:48,820
Yeah.

1415
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:55,540
I think I mean, beyond just the stupid nature of it's everybody wants to rule the world.

1416
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,460
Then there's a big world at the end.

1417
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:04,580
Yeah, that's just also it is like I like what I like the air that it casts onto the story

1418
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,500
of the ride, which is sort of like ignorable a little bit.

1419
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,780
You just know something's happening.

1420
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,460
You know, he's never you know, Eason's never winning.

1421
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:13,860
Yeah.

1422
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,780
You know, the Guardians have got this covered.

1423
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,980
But that was part of it.

1424
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:21,300
I think I said right after like it's like it just it put me at such ease that I was like,

1425
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,580
I'm not even worried about it.

1426
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,380
They got it.

1427
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,540
The Guardians Star Lord has this.

1428
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,900
He has it under control.

1429
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,580
And Eason thinks he can rule the world, but he can't.

1430
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:35,060
Yeah, like the song is telling me that what he's trying to do is futile

1431
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,100
and just don't even be concerned about it.

1432
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,380
Let it happen in the background.

1433
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,140
And you enjoy this moment.

1434
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,100
Enjoy this ride.

1435
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,300
Enjoy the song.

1436
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:48,340
Well, if you want to extrapolate it out into like a lesson of living your life.

1437
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,620
Yes, I do.

1438
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,340
That's exactly what I want to do, which I think is what you're getting at.

1439
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:58,420
It is really, you know, to take a moment and ignore everything that's whatever you

1440
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,900
in a moment when you can afford to ignore what's going on in the world and in your life

1441
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,780
and take a moment to feel peace and to feel that everything's going to be OK.

1442
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,300
That is kind of what no joke the ride feels like.

1443
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,900
Like that's exactly what happened.

1444
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,620
That's what this and not a lot of rides.

1445
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,420
Nothing to do with.

1446
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,940
Don't do that rocket raccoon, unfortunately, as much as I love rock.

1447
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:25,220
And I'm just glad YMCA is not on the ride because I'd be flashing right to the world's problems.

1448
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:25,780
Well, that's true.

1449
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,060
That would have been a direct reminder with one of our leaders favorite songs.

1450
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,300
Yeah.

1451
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,860
But no, this was like, you know, it doesn't it feel like almost a little subversive in that way?

1452
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,260
It does.

1453
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,500
Yeah.

1454
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,500
And yeah, to some degree, having a party song while there's a big fight going on,

1455
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
it's similar to the opening of Guardians 2.

1456
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,500
I believe you would like the opening scene to Guardians of the Galaxy 2.

1457
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:44,820
OK.

1458
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,540
It's little baby Groot dancing to Mr. Blue Sky

1459
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,540
while there's a big fight going on in the background.

1460
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,140
And he little baby Groot doesn't care.

1461
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,300
Mr. Blue Sky would be good in this mix.

1462
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:57,140
Yes, I wish they had put that in either of the rides.

1463
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:57,460
Yeah.

1464
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,660
Not sure why.

1465
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,740
You have to wonder with this full list.

1466
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,660
And this is where, you know, let me ask if anybody out there has inside intel

1467
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,860
or you know about the process or you could and we won't talk about it on the show,

1468
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:13,140
but if anybody just wanted to do us a solid and pass us like the I have the list,

1469
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,220
I have the hundred songs that they narrowed it down.

1470
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,260
Oh, I would love to hear.

1471
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:16,980
You know what?

1472
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,740
They did want Mr. Blue Sky, but Jeff Lynn said no or whatever it is.

1473
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,060
I think it's in the is it in the it's not in the queue

1474
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,060
because are excuse me in the exit queue.

1475
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,180
Surrenders in the exit.

1476
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,140
Surrenders in the exit because none of the songs from the movies directly are on the rides.

1477
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,140
None of the they all they are.

1478
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,660
These are all the first association of guardians with these songs.

1479
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:45,300
I believe so, unless there's maybe one on Mission Breakout, but they're mostly not.

1480
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,500
Well, that's what I think we've talked about before.

1481
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,660
That still is a big draw for theme parks to me.

1482
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,460
And that's when I was younger, certainly even more.

1483
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,180
So do go to these places.

1484
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:03,140
You get an experience that you can't get on VHS or you can't.

1485
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,900
So you're saying the new song is the new.

1486
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:10,100
Yeah, it's unique to this and a video of it is never going to.

1487
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,340
Even if like even if you synced up like perfect sound of the song

1488
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,420
with a ride through the song, it's not going to be the same.

1489
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,940
It's not going to do the same things.

1490
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,900
The big songs.

1491
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,460
I mean, I'm off the top of my head from Guardians of the Galaxy.

1492
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:27,060
Hooked on a feeling from the second movie is Brandy.

1493
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,980
That plays a lot of my favorite songs.

1494
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,740
Brandy, Brandy, really?

1495
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,100
Because you have because of the line about your love is the sea.

1496
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,660
So he likes the song Brandy, but he probably wouldn't like a song called bourbon.

1497
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,100
That's true.

1498
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,420
Well, if the sea was made of bourbon, it depends.

1499
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,100
But better to drink on this.

1500
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,900
Too sweet.

1501
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,220
A little sugar boy saying it's too sweet.

1502
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,820
Well, got to save those sugar grams for candy.

1503
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,700
For candy and cake.

1504
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,780
For candy and cake, yes.

1505
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,540
Turkish delight.

1506
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,220
So yeah, those are not on the ride.

1507
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,500
So I think they just decided.

1508
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:12,980
I don't know.

1509
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,500
It's great that it's its own thing.

1510
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,580
It's not just like it's got to be these songs because people know these from.

1511
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:21,380
Yeah, it makes like fully original experiences.

1512
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:27,380
I'm trying to think of any moments also that just hit hard within the ride sequence.

1513
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,820
I mean, not that I don't know.

1514
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,740
Like I said, I thought the cut down was great.

1515
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,460
However, it lands where when they tell you you did a good job,

1516
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,340
that last tunnel that I think kind of blows Space Mountain out of the water.

1517
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,300
It's a great ride regardless, but it was really hidden with this soundtrack.

1518
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,100
You know, I also had the thought, I don't know if it was on the rider later,

1519
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,980
is that this must be what going on Knights in White Satin was like.

1520
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:02,500
Yeah, talking about a ride with a song that is a moodier song.

1521
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,100
This is, of course, the ride from the Hard Rock Park.

1522
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,860
Yes, there only existed a short amount of time, but people really dark ride.

1523
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:10,980
Yes, the band, the Moody Blues.

1524
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,900
People talk about the ride.

1525
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,380
No joke in fun terms.

1526
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,900
It's hard to tell when you look at like there was a YouTube video.

1527
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,340
I think we've tried to find years ago.

1528
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:25,380
Sally Dark Ride put up an official YouTube ride, but it's still hard to tell, right?

1529
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,380
Like what the experience was like.

1530
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:31,300
Yes, it's hard to tell, but you can get the basic gist of it.

1531
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,060
And that is what I have watched.

1532
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,700
I feel like that was what I watched during the pandemic.

1533
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,460
Does it read at all?

1534
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,580
I feel like I looked at it and I was like, I kind of know,

1535
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,540
but the way people talk about it, it feels impossible.

1536
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,500
But I also, I mean, this is an app comparison and probably they were

1537
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,860
trying to get some of the emotion that this thing gets out of you.

1538
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,140
But like also, didn't it just kind of like putt around?

1539
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,700
That's not the same ride system.

1540
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,780
Certainly to move, make you literally feel like you're floating like this.

1541
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,660
Yeah, I agree.

1542
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,420
I don't, I don't think it's the same experience.

1543
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,380
I'm just, I was just trying to think of a parallel of something

1544
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,380
that was a moodier song.

1545
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:13,780
That Meow Wolf one you did in Colorado.

1546
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,180
Yes.

1547
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,860
I think similarly like, I mean, that was all different

1548
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,380
sculpturists and artists and stuff doing it.

1549
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,740
So certainly different from Knights in White Sand, but both kind of

1550
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,300
not really doing a straightforward A to B story.

1551
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:29,860
Sure.

1552
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,500
Yeah.

1553
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,420
And that left me thinking maybe A to B story is fine.

1554
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,620
Sometimes it's okay.

1555
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,940
I got no, sometimes got no problem with that.

1556
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:43,620
Seems like a lot of that day, your luck was, luck was not on your side.

1557
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:43,860
Yes.

1558
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:44,340
Yeah.

1559
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,180
I mean, I guess it's, I guess it makes sense.

1560
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,780
I can't over-intellectualize that a day at Epcot Center

1561
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,860
is going to be better than a day at Elitch Gardens.

1562
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,060
Maybe it's not all luck, but still you can have

1563
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,940
even in theme parks we love, you can have very unlucky days.

1564
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,260
Right.

1565
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,580
Just like I made that wrong decision and I got out of this line

1566
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,140
and I would have gotten through it if I hadn't bailed right then.

1567
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,620
But this was just the manifestation I think of the fates being on our side.

1568
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,020
Yeah.

1569
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,900
It felt heavenly after.

1570
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:16,020
I think we both were just like in this bliss state.

1571
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:16,820
It was wonderful.

1572
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:17,300
Yes.

1573
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,100
I was thinking too like most things, most rides are,

1574
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,940
we've talked about this before, chills and thrills.

1575
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,740
Oh yeah.

1576
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,980
You get a little scared on the lift hill.

1577
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,500
You get a thrill when you go down.

1578
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:26,900
Oh yeah.

1579
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,700
So what was this?

1580
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,220
But I'm trying and I don't have a good, we will have to pitch on this is what is this?

1581
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,580
This is a different thing.

1582
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,340
And this is what I've been talking about for a while.

1583
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:40,980
More feeling emotional, more feeling sadness, melancholy.

1584
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,860
It is what human beings need sometimes.

1585
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,140
As I said, I said this recently, you need it to be extracted from you sometimes.

1586
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,460
Yeah.

1587
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,740
That's at least I do.

1588
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,740
My emotions extracted from me.

1589
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,860
It's what music really helps with for sure.

1590
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,900
And it's what music does for me and what other things can do for me.

1591
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,420
Mostly music though.

1592
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,220
And it is a different, it's chills, thrills and something else.

1593
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,340
And I do think-

1594
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,420
Well it makes you feel like you're on pills.

1595
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,180
Good pills, yes.

1596
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,860
But I think this needs to be out there more.

1597
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,020
I think this idea needs to be in the ether more.

1598
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,940
Can you cheat and say fills, but you mean feels.

1599
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,300
You could.

1600
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:21,780
We could.

1601
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,020
Is there a way to say that?

1602
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,660
Can it sound like cool and slang?

1603
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,540
If I-

1604
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,740
Thrills, chills, and fills.

1605
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,500
Feels.

1606
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,980
I mean we can make it mean whenever we want.

1607
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,460
We are taste makers as well.

1608
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,340
Yeah, that's right.

1609
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:40,020
Well you know, this mission was inspiring.

1610
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,980
And now maybe I feel inspired to go on the mission of embracing being a taste maker.

1611
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:45,700
You're a taste maker.

1612
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,780
Embracing you being a taste maker.

1613
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,140
We all have our own things.

1614
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,100
We've directed.

1615
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,620
People do say sometimes I went to this place because of you.

1616
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,740
No, that makes me feel-

1617
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,460
And that's fun.

1618
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,100
Right, yes.

1619
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,260
Yes.

1620
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,900
Yeah, I had that experience recently with the Casa Benita.

1621
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,220
Yeah.

1622
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:05,780
Whereas somebody I'd never met despite friends in common and he said I'm going to Casa Benita.

1623
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:09,220
It's like, oh, I have this podcast and he's like, why do you think I'm going?

1624
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:09,780
Oh, okay.

1625
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,340
It feels good.

1626
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:10,740
Well that's good.

1627
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,780
It feels really good.

1628
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,500
So that one-

1629
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:16,340
Because I think we all have the thing where we are just kind of unbridled,

1630
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,620
excited about certain things and want to make sure to shine a light on Casa Benita being one of them.

1631
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,460
I would also, I mean, that's how I feel about this.

1632
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,420
I want to tell everybody go on this ride and get Tears for Fears,

1633
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,260
but that's not really in your control.

1634
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:30,740
It's very hard.

1635
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,820
I guess just, you know, keep going.

1636
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,900
Go to Epcot as much as you can.

1637
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,740
Pay Disney as much money as you can.

1638
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,380
Because you try to get, try until you get this song.

1639
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:43,780
Could you do, could you put in, would AirPods stay in your ears if you just did it yourself?

1640
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,340
Depends on how good, like-

1641
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,300
How good the things are.

1642
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:47,860
They fit.

1643
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,660
Have you like taped, duct taped them around your head?

1644
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,780
Like my right ear stays in really good.

1645
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,700
My left ear is always falling out.

1646
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,140
You've got a sloppy left inner hole.

1647
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,780
I got a sloppy ear hole.

1648
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,780
I've got a sloppy left ear hole.

1649
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:03,700
Well, that's yeah.

1650
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,860
Now, as long as you know that, then you shouldn't do it.

1651
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,300
What did we call the pecs earlier?

1652
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,020
Was it sloppy?

1653
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:08,740
Sloppy pecs?

1654
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,620
Sloppy pecs.

1655
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,180
Give me a sloppy pec near my sloppy ear hole.

1656
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:18,580
I got curious if this was a just us epiphany.

1657
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:26,980
I don't know what has been landing as the agreed upon favorite song across the Epcot world.

1658
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,420
But I decided to take it to our listeners.

1659
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,420
I put this up on the Patreon.

1660
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,580
I did a poll asking what's the best song.

1661
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,660
And sure enough, everybody wants to rule the world.

1662
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,100
Number one with a bullet.

1663
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,620
Pretty handily, I would say.

1664
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,780
Currently, with 1,200 people weighing in, everybody wants to rule the world at 35.

1665
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,140
September at 28.

1666
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,420
September seems to be...

1667
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,700
I was wondering if September was people's favorite.

1668
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,820
And I'm a big fan of that song.

1669
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,420
And I'd be excited to get that song.

1670
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,060
Sure.

1671
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,820
Wake me up when September ends.

1672
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,860
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1673
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,100
Yes.

1674
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:02,820
No, you got it.

1675
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,500
No, it really unlocks the perfection of that song.

1676
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:14,100
Yeah, actually, the order is kind of like exactly what they rank it.

1677
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,780
Our listeners collectively rank it at everybody wants to rule the world.

1678
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,860
September, Conga, Iran, which I'd be interested to get one way or another in Disco Inferno,

1679
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,140
all the way at the bottom.

1680
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,460
I think there's a time and place for Disco Inferno.

1681
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,860
But I think some of these are just like a little deeper cuts.

1682
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,340
I don't know.

1683
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,700
And I'm just I'm happy to hear that we're not crazy.

1684
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,700
And that people are feeling the feelings here as are we.

1685
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,580
I got a couple of people in Orlando when I was mentioning that.

1686
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,300
I don't remember if I mentioned we did it or we're going to try.

1687
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,700
But they were like, oh, yeah, it's the best one.

1688
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,180
Really?

1689
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:49,780
I guess it is out there.

1690
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,460
I don't think I knew what was landing.

1691
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,500
I didn't know either.

1692
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,380
Yeah, yeah.

1693
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,260
I did not pick this to be one of the crowd.

1694
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,420
I did not do it to be popular.

1695
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,140
No, no.

1696
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:02,260
We had this locked and loaded.

1697
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,500
And really quickly, by virtue of us posting that,

1698
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,780
there were a couple of interesting comments just to run through quickly,

1699
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,660
some of which shines a light on some of these other songs

1700
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,740
and what's good about them or bad about them.

1701
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,420
Emily A.

1702
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,860
I have never paid attention to whatever story is happening on this ride.

1703
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:20,340
I only vibed to the music and enjoy the coaster.

1704
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,300
Everybody wants to rule the world as the ultimate ride experience through this method.

1705
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,140
That's totally what I've been saying.

1706
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:25,860
I agree.

1707
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,980
It honestly made me forget that Marvel was even part of it.

1708
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,260
You guys were talking about Marvel.

1709
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,140
Cover your ears, Jason.

1710
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,980
And I was like, oh, no.

1711
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,260
Why are you talking about Marvel, though?

1712
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,780
We're talking about Choose Your Fears Ride.

1713
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:36,660
I did.

1714
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,700
I did have to go back.

1715
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,180
It's the first time we rode in and now watch video

1716
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:45,940
because I couldn't track the story when we were being ripped around in conga.

1717
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,660
Doesn't matter.

1718
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,300
That's what it is.

1719
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,700
It feels like these big dicks are going to fight.

1720
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,460
They're going to do whatever they're going to do.

1721
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:57,620
And all you can do, all you can try to do is be at peace and tune it out.

1722
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,460
Don't stop having moments that you need to have.

1723
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,060
Even with that, I kind of like that.

1724
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,460
It's like I truly I hear a voice.

1725
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,500
I think that's Chris Pratt.

1726
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,660
I think I think that's Rocket.

1727
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,220
I don't know.

1728
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:10,980
Fake Rocket.

1729
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,460
That's fake.

1730
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,420
I think that's fake.

1731
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,620
I think it's not Bradley Cooper.

1732
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:14,820
It's no way.

1733
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:21,860
Here's here's one from Joe Martin to give some shine to the last place in the poll.

1734
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,860
I've only been on the ride once and I got Disco Inferno.

1735
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:27,380
I'm too young to have experienced this, but it made me feel like I was roller skating

1736
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,420
backwards at a roller rink in the late 70s at certain points.

1737
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,100
That's fine.

1738
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,820
Yeah, about that next time I don't want to.

1739
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,860
Brian, I ran is the only one that sounds like it could have been written for the ride.

1740
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,460
The guitar strum delay at the beginning is the perfect complement to the Big Bang launch.

1741
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,460
The pace of the song matches your speed throughout the lyrics idea of running through space.

1742
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,660
It works on several levels.

1743
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,940
I think I really enjoy.

1744
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,700
I could see that being very good.

1745
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,140
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.

1746
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:57,300
And I definitely the people who put this together had these thoughts.

1747
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,460
They knew these these were moody.

1748
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,740
These were different types of songs.

1749
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,500
I mean, I just love to know the process and they tested them and what were the what did

1750
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,140
they not do?

1751
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,940
If you're serious, if you're in there and you know anything and you can tell us anything,

1752
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:08,500
let us know.

1753
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:13,540
Zach Wolf says, I know people love September, but as a wedding photographer,

1754
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,780
that song is triggering lol.

1755
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,340
Yes, I could see I could see that.

1756
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:21,460
That might be kind of the downside of a Disco Inferno or something.

1757
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:25,300
I think that's some of the that of all of these, everybody wants to rule the world is the one

1758
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:29,060
that's like, but that's not that's that's a song that might make you sad.

1759
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,060
It might make you feel a little something.

1760
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:35,780
Zach would say, don't wake him up when September ends or wake him up.

1761
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,300
No, when September ends is what he wants.

1762
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,540
Oh, he does when he wants to sleep through the song, not the month.

1763
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,740
David, I do love screaming body.

1764
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,060
Ah, when I get September, more people singing along.

1765
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:47,700
That's fun.

1766
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:51,700
But that ethereal intro, everybody wants to rule the world just feels perfect for this ride and

1767
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,340
its story.

1768
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,380
Thousand percent.

1769
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,020
Yeah.

1770
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:58,260
Madison Lane, not to be corny, but everybody wants to rule the world is the one that makes

1771
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,660
you feel truly transcendent.

1772
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,820
Yeah, that's completely how I feel.

1773
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,180
I've been trying to not worry about being corny in this episode.

1774
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:10,980
I may have been, but I that's yeah, there's got to be a time to listen.

1775
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,540
I worry about listeners have never been embarrassed for us before.

1776
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,900
I'm sure before this.

1777
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:22,260
Seven years of macho steak and bourbon guys, real steak and bourbon guys.

1778
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,220
They're so cool.

1779
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:28,340
Masculine, high tea, high tea motherfuckers is what people generally consider us.

1780
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:32,820
I bet if they met listeners who likes their stuff, the interactions would go

1781
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,420
calmly and normally and they would not be thinking about how bad the interaction went.

1782
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:36,740
Yes.

1783
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,540
For weeks later.

1784
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:43,220
Megan Temple Club 3 polling has conditioned me to be skeptical that this isn't somehow about

1785
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:43,860
bug main.

1786
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,460
I understand.

1787
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,500
I know it should be.

1788
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,660
People were suspicious in general.

1789
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:48,980
Yeah.

1790
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,580
And I understand that.

1791
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:54,420
I would say it was nice to have a poll that wasn't people fighting about bug main.

1792
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,820
Well, in six months, we'll get there.

1793
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:57,220
Yeah, yeah.

1794
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:57,780
Five or six months.

1795
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,900
We'll finally be free of this.

1796
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,140
And then this I like too in terms of suspicion.

1797
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:07,700
Ryan O'Reilly, I can't wait to hear which episode this comes up in and why Scott and

1798
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,220
Mike are arguing over it.

1799
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,020
Oh, interesting.

1800
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,060
I'm really glad that we proved Ryan wrong.

1801
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,420
That is true.

1802
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:20,100
A lot of music oriented sparring between us for episode after episode.

1803
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,780
So it's so nice to go have that big piece of musical and ride harmony together.

1804
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,220
Quite the opposite, Ryan.

1805
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,300
I'm happy to flip your expectations.

1806
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,980
But Ryan, I'll say this.

1807
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,340
If all goes to plan, you'll get some of it somewhat soon.

1808
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,940
You'll get some of that arguing soon.

1809
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,260
Jelly Rolls, you're saying?

1810
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,860
Possibly a Jelly Rolls episode if all goes to plan.

1811
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:47,060
Yeah, this song was great, but I think the ride would be perfectly synced to

1812
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,740
two guys playing lose yourself on pianos.

1813
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,700
Perfectly synced to a cover of We Don't Talk About Bruno.

1814
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:00,100
Last minute cancellation on my part for Jelly Rolls.

1815
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,940
I get too distracted thinking about delicious jelly rolls.

1816
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,780
And I don't make it.

1817
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,660
While you're listening to Jelly Rolls.

1818
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,300
You walk up to the door and you say, yes, I'd like three.

1819
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:10,820
Three what?

1820
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,460
Do you forget the name of the establishment you were in?

1821
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,660
What are all these people sitting in here for?

1822
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,220
I thought this was a grab and go establishment.

1823
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,140
You sit by the water and eat your delicious rolls.

1824
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:24,740
Think about your life.

1825
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,380
Anyway, that's that.

1826
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,420
I was glad to see it win.

1827
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,700
I'm glad to see people are in sync with us here.

1828
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,180
I also really quickly want to mention about the song itself.

1829
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:45,700
Maybe some of the reason that the world syncs up with it so well is that in some ways,

1830
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,540
we aren't even realizing that it's taking us back to the mid 90s.

1831
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:54,340
And we're getting excited for a brand new episode of Dennis Miller Live to begin.

1832
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:58,420
I think we all remember that at the start of each Dennis Miller Live,

1833
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:03,220
before the ranting started, that Dennis would walk into a pool hall,

1834
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:07,860
walk up to a billiards table where all of the balls were little earths.

1835
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,260
And when this song was playing, these memorable notes are playing.

1836
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:20,180
And then he would draw back the cue and then get all but one of the balls in on one attempt.

1837
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:24,660
But then one would just be teetering right at the edge because even Dennis Miller ain't perfect.

1838
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,160
Wow.

1839
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,020
Believe it or not, I don't remember that.

1840
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,660
You don't?

1841
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,660
You don't remember this being HBO's Emmy winning?

1842
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,500
This was the last week tonight of its time.

1843
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,500
My dad would watch it.

1844
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,180
I would wander out into the living room and see him watching it and be like,

1845
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:43,700
well, this is an adult show for sophisticated comedy fans.

1846
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,140
And I would leave.

1847
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:48,100
And that's really all my perception of Dennis was.

1848
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,980
I saw him on Weekend Update a little bit when I watched the reruns.

1849
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,620
Yeah.

1850
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,940
But still, I was like, well, this man's too smart for me.

1851
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,980
Well, he shows it at the beginning that he comes out.

1852
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,340
He's the one wheeling and dealing.

1853
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,820
This guy's got to know about politics.

1854
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,580
He can make all those earths go into these holes.

1855
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,980
Also just want to say I had never listened to the full album that this song

1856
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,980
comes from, 1985, songs from the big chair.

1857
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,180
I listened to it when we were on the flight back.

1858
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:14,660
Perfect.

1859
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,700
Perfect album.

1860
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,500
It's so good.

1861
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,140
All the hits are from that one.

1862
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,580
Shout is from that album.

1863
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,980
Head Over Heels is from that album, which is also,

1864
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,140
I feel equal to Everybody Wants to Drill the World,

1865
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,780
incredible song, moving song.

1866
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:31,940
And on the full album, it is really great paired with,

1867
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,620
it's like part of this suite with another song, Broken,

1868
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:38,100
which it is in the single of it, too.

1869
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,660
But I didn't realize it was part of a movement.

1870
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:43,380
And that zone, especially, was wonderful.

1871
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,940
And Tears for Fears are great in general.

1872
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,740
Also really good covers of this song by Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,

1873
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,260
which they did for AV Club.

1874
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:52,900
That's excellent.

1875
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,340
When AV Club was a single, Undercover, bands would come in

1876
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,060
and crowd into this room, and they'd have to cross off from a list.

1877
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,980
I think Ted Leo might have chosen early and gotten this one.

1878
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,540
And he says at a time in his life, this was maybe his favorite song.

1879
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:06,900
It's an excellent cover.

1880
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,660
That cover might have helped me years ago,

1881
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,620
start to really see the song in a new light and really love the song.

1882
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,020
I was very engaged in this cover series.

1883
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,900
Maybe I have seen that.

1884
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:19,060
There is an excellent, they might be Giants cover of Tub Thumping,

1885
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,820
where the entire office comes in.

1886
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:21,460
I've seen that.

1887
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,660
I watched that earlier today.

1888
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,860
That is fun.

1889
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,940
Mayor Hawthorne, one of my favorite guys, does a great cover, too.

1890
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:28,100
It's also been covered by Lorde and been covered by Gru.

1891
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,460
Oh, Gru.

1892
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,100
Yeah, Gru did.

1893
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:30,740
I love to see.

1894
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:34,820
Upcoming, up-and-coming artist Gru did it in the Little Known

1895
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,100
film Despicable Me 4.

1896
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,780
My daughter is finally requesting to watch the Minions on the TV.

1897
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,180
Wow.

1898
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:45,060
After just knowing them on T-shirts at Universal City.

1899
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,420
Things she point at in the park.

1900
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,140
Yeah, yeah.

1901
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:51,860
Well, she probably has the attention span for the shorts,

1902
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,140
which I think are all on.

1903
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,340
She's watching the movie.

1904
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,620
Oh, she is watching the movie.

1905
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,260
Yeah, she's good.

1906
01:19:56,260 --> 01:20:01,140
She identifies with the girls with Agnes and company.

1907
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:01,940
I don't know about that.

1908
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,300
With the stellar writing of Evan Susser and Van Robichow, of course.

1909
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,500
That's what's resonating.

1910
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,300
That's right.

1911
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:07,800
Yes.

1912
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,320
Anyways.

1913
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,260
So yeah, I was also looking.

1914
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:16,820
I was trying to figure out if there's any other experiences like this in Rides.

1915
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,340
On the emotional side of things.

1916
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:18,980
Yes.

1917
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:22,020
Because you've said, this might have been a mail back or something.

1918
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,180
We went on a tear about emotional media and you were talking about

1919
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:27,540
wanting Neil Young after the gold rush or something.

1920
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:27,620
Yeah.

1921
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,500
There's something to that.

1922
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:33,060
It is like this is the version that actually ultimately,

1923
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,500
I think you're never going to get moody.

1924
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,460
You're not going to get Joni Mitchell on a roller coaster.

1925
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,260
But this does feel like, well, this is because it's driving

1926
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:45,460
and it is close to party music, but it works on the other side too.

1927
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:45,860
Yes.

1928
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,820
Probably, yes.

1929
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,380
Probably not some sad.

1930
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,940
I mean, you did come up when we were talking about

1931
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:54,020
Smashing Pumpkins Replacing Aerosmith.

1932
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,780
Like a tonight tonight would work.

1933
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,020
That would be pretty cool.

1934
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,060
And as a driving.

1935
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:02,100
I think it would be an extremely strange move in 2025.

1936
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,500
Well, if they completely rebranded the Aerosmith.

1937
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,020
Yes, the Smashing Pumpkins.

1938
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:06,820
I agree.

1939
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:11,220
But in a grab bag ride potentially, just that song could maybe exist.

1940
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,260
I had a lot that I cut from things that I was going to bring up

1941
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,180
while I was gone from the Scott Free episodes.

1942
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:19,540
But you were talking to Cardona about, you were telling him

1943
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,580
that they should redo the ride with Rolling Stones and Kiss.

1944
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,780
I said I wanted older men.

1945
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,140
You wanted all even older men.

1946
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:25,700
Yeah.

1947
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,060
Man, I align with Cardona a lot.

1948
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:29,700
He's your guy, I know.

1949
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:33,460
Yeah, he kept going, gah, what, ah.

1950
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,260
And then you brought up, I don't know, I guess you could do Taylor Swift.

1951
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:39,060
But then you said she's not high energy enough.

1952
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:45,220
First of all, I was like, good, did Mr. Trump take over the podcast for a second?

1953
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:49,300
But secondly, I'm like, there's not one Taylor Swift song

1954
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,220
that would work for not a single one.

1955
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,980
Well, there was a Taylor on Jelly Rolls.

1956
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,820
The second night I was at Jelly Rolls, there was a Taylor Swift song.

1957
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:57,540
Was that high energy enough for the high caliber of Jelly Rolls?

1958
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:58,900
It was fun.

1959
01:21:58,900 --> 01:21:59,620
Yes, it was fun.

1960
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,260
It was an early.

1961
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,380
It was, I forget, why can't I think of it?

1962
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:01,860
What song?

1963
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:02,660
I'm trying to think.

1964
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,860
Kind of obscure one.

1965
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,900
One that wasn't even really released.

1966
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,620
Whatever that one is.

1967
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,940
It's not so high energy.

1968
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:15,860
I'm still worried the Muppets aren't high energy enough for that ride system.

1969
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,580
I don't know.

1970
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,660
But either they make up a new song or they-

1971
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,580
Well, I think they're going to be covering song.

1972
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,460
That's what I'm guessing.

1973
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:22,580
I still think that's what it's going to be.

1974
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,940
Just tell me, it's not Disney songs, is it?

1975
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,220
Oh, I don't know about that.

1976
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,020
That's possible.

1977
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:34,740
I do think it's like Meghan Trainor and Miss Piggy singing a new song.

1978
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,020
Where are you pulling that from?

1979
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:40,020
Because they said there would be current artists with Muppets.

1980
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,860
Is Meghan Trainor an actual one?

1981
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,420
Or are you just saying-

1982
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,500
No, that's just because she's always on this stuff.

1983
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,060
I don't know.

1984
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:45,940
Jesus Christ.

1985
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,500
Here in this episode, we have a lot of musical blissing.

1986
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,540
I don't know, but there's a lot of singers out there.

1987
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,180
Jelly Rolls?

1988
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,460
Disney, if anyone's listening, you need to look

1989
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,660
further than the people who are on your goddamn specials every year.

1990
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:04,100
I am not one of these people who, unlike some of my co-hosts,

1991
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,580
you can take out Aerosmith and I don't give a shit.

1992
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,540
But if you replace it with Meghan Trainor, we have a problem.

1993
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,020
Sabrina Carpenter grew up in the family.

1994
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,580
She's too bawdy now it is.

1995
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,940
Too big, too bawdy.

1996
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:18,580
Too popular.

1997
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,420
Too popular, yeah.

1998
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,000
Yeah.

1999
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:27,460
Jason, any other songstresses top on the charts these days?

2000
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,900
Boy Genius?

2001
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,180
No, no, no, not that.

2002
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,460
He does have a Boy Genius though.

2003
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:34,100
Like any young singers.

2004
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,140
Chula.

2005
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:35,780
Haim.

2006
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:40,820
No, no, no, not a blonde, but a redhead.

2007
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,340
Lucy Dawkus is black.

2008
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,460
God, we're never getting there.

2009
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:45,940
Can you see a ball?

2010
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,220
We're never getting there.

2011
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:47,720
Redhead?

2012
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,240
Oh, he's not in the time that I want it.

2013
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,120
He's not giving it to me.

2014
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,240
Brandy Carlisle.

2015
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,160
Geez.

2016
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,360
You're messing with me.

2017
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:03,560
So I was trying to figure out what other rides could have songs that are sad.

2018
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,920
And I, of course, RIP Ride Rocket, the ride that Jason has been on,

2019
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:07,880
but we have not been on.

2020
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,640
And I have pledged that I will do it before.

2021
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:16,440
A Universal Floral Opera, which has like a secret menu that you can dial in.

2022
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,000
In a regular venue.

2023
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,280
If you're in a phone booth.

2024
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,400
But a regular menu as well.

2025
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,440
A regular menu as well.

2026
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:20,940
Yeah.

2027
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,440
Yeah.

2028
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,120
And I don't know this list very well at all.

2029
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,240
You did a dive.

2030
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,600
Yes, I have it in front of me and there are a lot of options.

2031
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,440
So there are, I don't think it's going to be, it's going to hit the same way

2032
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,160
because it's an outdoor coaster that no one seems to like.

2033
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:35,880
Yes.

2034
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,960
And it's not like an incredible light show and like, yeah.

2035
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,640
Maybe at night it'll be better.

2036
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:46,600
It's got the unpleasant vertical slow launch that I absolutely hate.

2037
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,800
It's my least favorite thing.

2038
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,040
Yeah.

2039
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,880
Seems like the opposite of this, the instantaneous launch

2040
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,720
with the magical first notes of the song.

2041
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,220
Yeah.

2042
01:24:55,080 --> 01:25:01,000
You got anything that you think can be in terms of not thrills and chills, but fills.

2043
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,080
So they have, they do have, and this is of interest to you,

2044
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,600
Ride Like the Wind by Christopher Cross.

2045
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,200
Which would be interesting to be on a coaster.

2046
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:10,680
Okay.

2047
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,400
Because that's got a nice, you obviously, you know, it's a nice little vibe groove to it.

2048
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,520
Yeah. You got to crank it.

2049
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,920
That's still, it still is a little soft, but I think.

2050
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,480
Yeah. Yeah.

2051
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,520
You crank that baby up.

2052
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,320
Could be interesting.

2053
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,000
I'll tell you, it's great on a pontoon.

2054
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,320
Of course.

2055
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,600
That's what it was written for.

2056
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,100
Yeah. Yeah.

2057
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,800
They have rainbow connection that you can get on the secret menu.

2058
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,680
That's strange.

2059
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,560
It is strange.

2060
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,480
And I don't think it will work.

2061
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,240
I just think it's like almost like two, unless, depending on the version of it.

2062
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,760
That's like putting a slow kid's song in a scary movie trailer.

2063
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,720
Yeah. I don't know.

2064
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,160
It's meant to be the opposite.

2065
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,640
We'll see if I can go on this more than once.

2066
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,000
Also played at Jelly Rolls.

2067
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,440
Because I would like, yes, that is true.

2068
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,320
Ride Like the Wind was played at Jelly Rolls, I forget.

2069
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,880
And a certain red haired singer's song was also played.

2070
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,640
Who? Can anyone name her?

2071
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,120
Lucille Ball.

2072
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,480
She's usually named.

2073
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,200
Yeah.

2074
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,240
Lucille Ball's song.

2075
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,040
Now what I thought was interesting on this list is that they have,

2076
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,520
well, where is it?

2077
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:18,600
It's My Everything by Barry White, which I'm like, I don't know how that feels.

2078
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,160
It's a very romantic, groovy song, which I like a lot, but I'm like, I don't know.

2079
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,040
So there's a lot more.

2080
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,480
There's a lot more like mystery to some of these.

2081
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,880
And especially how they're going to be playing at a

2082
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,640
coaster that doesn't seem to be very popular.

2083
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,640
Although some people are like, it's fun, whatever.

2084
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,640
The thrill is gone by B.B. King.

2085
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,440
You can select.

2086
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,880
Why are these on here?

2087
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,080
There's like a hundred of them.

2088
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,040
There's so many.

2089
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,960
There's so lose yourself is on the list.

2090
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,040
That sort of makes sense.

2091
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,280
Yeah.

2092
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:44,520
Yeah.

2093
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,440
Any of them time out remotely, right?

2094
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,320
I think they can't.

2095
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,440
There's just no way.

2096
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,160
Yeah.

2097
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:54,040
Maybe unless I'm completely wrong, but still Rock and Roll to Me by Billy Joel.

2098
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,520
I mean, it's not my favorite song, although I kind of like it as far as

2099
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,160
the Billy Joel like pop hits.

2100
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:07,160
It's closer to what I like, but still, how can you throw any shade at any Billy Joel

2101
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,120
when you love Jelly Rolls with every fiber of your bit?

2102
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,080
This is Billy Joel.

2103
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,400
Jelly Rolls is a different thing than Jolly Rolls.

2104
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,560
Did you get for the longest time or?

2105
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,400
We are Piano Man.

2106
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,960
Well, really not a place where you can hear Piano Man.

2107
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,080
That's right.

2108
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,600
Is that when everyone's leaving like a last call playing piano?

2109
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,440
Oh, that's like that's early in the set.

2110
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:30,840
That's full.

2111
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,960
That's the opening set.

2112
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,720
They've got Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin.

2113
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:34,840
That makes sense to me.

2114
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,880
That's a high energy.

2115
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,360
Crocodile Rock seems really fun.

2116
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,040
Are these all secret ones?

2117
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,800
These, I think, are all on the secret list.

2118
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,960
But you're like Crocodile Rock for sure.

2119
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,320
Well, that's not a set.

2120
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,280
Taylor does not have anything close to Crocodile Rock.

2121
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,960
I'm talking about Rip Ride Rocket here.

2122
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,080
Not Rock and Roller Coaster.

2123
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:51,960
Different coaster.

2124
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,160
Crocodile Rock couldn't cut Muster on Rock and Roller Coaster.

2125
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,040
I don't know.

2126
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,040
Does it get close to whatever the song was about young girls that's currently on there?

2127
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,120
There's a lot of sketchiness.

2128
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,600
I think on the regular menu, Intergalactic is available.

2129
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:14,440
The regular menu, if I recall, was a lot of the biggest hits of 2009 and 2010.

2130
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,600
Don't Funk With My Heart by the Black Eyed Peas.

2131
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,040
There we go.

2132
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:18,920
That's going to do it.

2133
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,680
Oh, I want that song.

2134
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,080
I want the Will.i.am Mick Jagger song.

2135
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,200
You guys know that song?

2136
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,000
Yeah, I do know that song.

2137
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,280
You can go hard, hard like a rockin' roll.

2138
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,360
Explode!

2139
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:35,480
Rob Thomas tried to give Mick Jagger the song Disease from Matchbox 20's third album,

2140
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,520
and Mick Jagger said, no, I don't want it.

2141
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:43,000
But then he did the song with Will.i.am, and I think Disease is a better song than that.

2142
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:44,920
So I don't know what Mick was thinking.

2143
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,680
What song could possibly be better than Go Hard or whatever it's called?

2144
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,200
Yeah, I don't remember.

2145
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,960
Baby, baby!

2146
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,600
Highly recommended, listeners.

2147
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,280
Will.i.am x Mick Jagger.

2148
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:02,520
There is The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance, which is a song I like,

2149
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:09,080
and what I'm trying to do right now is let's decide what am I picking for my first one of all of these.

2150
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:09,800
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

2151
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,320
What do we think that should be?

2152
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,520
Should it be Black Parade?

2153
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,800
I think that's what I'm leaning to, honestly.

2154
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,400
I think the Rainbow Connection is too.

2155
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,520
It's not even going to register.

2156
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,720
It's like the banjo.

2157
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,600
It's weird.

2158
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:24,200
That is probably the best way to what Jason was saying in the era that it was.

2159
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,360
Vogue by Madonna?

2160
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,000
I don't know.

2161
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,760
Lose Yourself?

2162
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,200
No, I'm not doing that.

2163
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,200
I feel like My Everything or Black Parade is what I'm leaning towards.

2164
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,720
My Everything sounds interesting.

2165
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,920
I don't know that it's going to make me ascend to a higher plane.

2166
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,320
I don't know.

2167
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:39,880
Do both.

2168
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:40,600
Do both.

2169
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,360
I don't want to do this once.

2170
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,880
I don't want this vertical climb.

2171
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,640
Do they still have Kanye on their hair?

2172
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,140
Oh, God.

2173
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,520
They might.

2174
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:50,920
I don't know.

2175
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:56,600
Is it too loaded or is it too complicated to remove?

2176
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,440
Where it's like, ah, we're leaving it.

2177
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,200
We don't have access to that machine.

2178
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,880
This whole thing's run on a Pono, so we can't really do much.

2179
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,880
It's only the religious stuff.

2180
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,160
They play out of the Christian events.

2181
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,320
Oh, I forgot about the Christian era.

2182
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,080
For listener, what Christian song would be the most,

2183
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,760
what would make you have more of a religious epiphany on Rip Ride Rocket?

2184
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,120
Our God is an awesome God.

2185
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,600
There's hella good on here.

2186
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,920
Speaking of Christian people.

2187
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,360
Oh, right.

2188
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:31,480
Anyway.

2189
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,840
With arms wide open?

2190
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,360
Is there any creed on there?

2191
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,880
I would do creed in a second.

2192
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,520
Not with arms wide open.

2193
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,360
I would do my sacrifice.

2194
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,000
I would love.

2195
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,320
Well, that was one shot around the corner.

2196
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,200
That would rule.

2197
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,160
I don't like creed.

2198
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:49,160
I wouldn't like going on that ride, but I recognize that the combo.

2199
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:53,480
That could be, you know, as we've been saying, like, look, weird combinations.

2200
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,720
I like a Marvel ride a lot.

2201
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,160
This is where it happens.

2202
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,600
Yeah, you have to tailor it to.

2203
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,840
I mean, that's a perfect marriage right there.

2204
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,680
Yeah, that would be if it exists.

2205
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:06,120
I don't think you can do it, but that's I would pick that if you could.

2206
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,360
So right now, I'm leaning toward my chemical romance.

2207
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,600
Well, listeners, throw your creative experience.

2208
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,800
People that have been, let me know.

2209
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,600
Yeah, yeah.

2210
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,640
Have you done?

2211
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,680
Which one's better?

2212
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,880
Barry White or Mike?

2213
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:21,320
Have you been on this ride enough to do both Barry White and my chemical romance?

2214
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:21,800
If so.

2215
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:28,440
And boy, it makes you wish that we had little dial buttons for this ride.

2216
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,000
I think you're missing two big ones on here, Mike.

2217
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,560
Oh, go ahead.

2218
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,240
Bring me to life by Evan S.

2219
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,200
Oh, I did just see that.

2220
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,480
That's borderline Christian.

2221
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,880
Rolling by Limp Bizkit.

2222
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,080
Oh, that's good, too.

2223
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,040
A new contender.

2224
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,240
Yeah, that's in the mix.

2225
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:43,720
Yeah.

2226
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,000
Limp Bizkit roller coaster.

2227
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,160
I think I love break stuff, too.

2228
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,120
They had break stuff on there.

2229
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,240
That would be my ideal.

2230
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,200
Does that have a big influence on second level?

2231
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:52,920
We covered it.

2232
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,960
You covered it.

2233
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,600
Yeah.

2234
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,120
You covered break stuff.

2235
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:56,620
Yep.

2236
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:57,960
We sure did.

2237
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,680
I had to learn all of break stuff.

2238
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,640
Sabotage.

2239
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,000
I mean, that's legitimate.

2240
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,040
Sabotage and Intergalactic are good ones.

2241
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:06,680
Yeah.

2242
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,840
There's a Ferg- Glamorous by Fergie.

2243
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,640
How about I get a Fergie now?

2244
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,760
That's so thrilling to me.

2245
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,720
That could be me.

2246
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:14,280
Yeah.

2247
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,720
There's Flowdown by Modest Mouse,

2248
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,360
which would be interesting on The Guardian's coaster,

2249
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:18,840
I feel like.

2250
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,280
That's kind of a fun little-

2251
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,760
It's funny that you liked playing breaking stuff

2252
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,440
because I know that in breaking-

2253
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,400
I like playing break stuff

2254
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,040
because I know that in your childhood,

2255
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,960
you would have never been allowed to break stuff.

2256
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,520
No, it was cathartic to do that in a different way,

2257
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,040
to talk about breaking things

2258
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,280
and beating a guy up or whatever the song's about.

2259
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,680
I'm going to pretend not that it's my mom.

2260
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,320
That's too far.

2261
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,560
I'm going to pretend that I'm beating up my mom's rules.

2262
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,440
Take that rule.

2263
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,480
Break your fucking face tonight.

2264
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,560
Mike, Vertigo by U2.

2265
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,200
Yeah, I know.

2266
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,160
It's not my favorite.

2267
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,920
But this is what I think is so great

2268
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,800
is that they have this odd confluence of things

2269
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,040
and the James Gunn and as much as this would be-

2270
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,560
and now it suddenly becomes like

2271
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,840
there's a weird way that you can go

2272
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,840
on the Modest Mouse roller coaster.

2273
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,720
That would never happen.

2274
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,240
That would never be built from the ground up.

2275
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,120
I just really love and value that

2276
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,720
through a weird confluence of events

2277
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,120
that you can ride on a pretty goddamn perfect

2278
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,200
Tears for Fears roller coaster.

2279
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,440
There is no world where suddenly they're like,

2280
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,040
guess what?

2281
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,960
Universal's been talking to Kurt Smith's camp.

2282
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,640
Just because of a certain events

2283
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,800
that landed in the right way.

2284
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,360
Just as our day played out right up until the end

2285
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,920
where this was a great day for me and Epcot

2286
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:45,480
and music, music that I like very much

2287
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,520
because- and this is where I have-

2288
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,400
look, I have no right to throw shade at you musically

2289
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,360
because of how much I goddamn enjoy

2290
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,560
getting to see a five-song set by Jason Scheff.

2291
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,680
Jason Scheff, if you don't know and you maybe don't,

2292
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,360
is the guy who took over as the lead singer

2293
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,040
of Chicago from Peter Satara.

2294
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,040
Great set, great- everything I could ask for a chef

2295
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:06,680
from a chef set.

2296
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,640
Along comes a woman.

2297
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,920
What kind of man would I be?

2298
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,040
Just you and me.

2299
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,680
Hard to say I'm sorry with Get Away, the ending,

2300
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,920
which is one of my favorite pieces of music.

2301
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,200
That's my hype of music.

2302
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,560
That's what I listen to.

2303
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,560
Anything that's making me nervous, I will like,

2304
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,440
let me get in the groove.

2305
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,840
It's a song that Aaron and I play when we're arriving,

2306
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,680
if we're pulling into Disney World,

2307
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,520
if we're pulling into Vegas, we listen to that.

2308
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,480
Hard to say I'm sorry is a fine ballad, whatever.

2309
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:32,280
It's like a cousin of You're the Inspiration,

2310
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,000
but Get Away.

2311
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
When it gets rocking at the end

2312
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,400
with Koki, David Foster energy,

2313
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,320
and I got to hear it in Epcot Center,

2314
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,960
under the shadow of the American Adventure

2315
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,200
and next to a sign for George Bush's paintings.

2316
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,600
That's the darkest.

2317
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,240
That's really-

2318
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:49,880
America.

2319
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,960
Being, being, yes, and I've said it many times,

2320
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,080
that World Showcase really is the draw.

2321
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,640
When you ever think about maybe just packing it all up

2322
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,760
and going down there and you go,

2323
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,280
there is a World Showcase

2324
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,920
and you could be there like five nights of the week.

2325
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,560
You could be there so often.

2326
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,200
Wouldn't it be weird if you lived there?

2327
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:12,280
You'd be there and there'd be great concerts every night.

2328
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,040
Although I think there's a break in concerts

2329
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,560
when we were there for the live shows.

2330
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,520
I just looked this up.

2331
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,200
There's Garden Rocks ends

2332
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,280
and then Eat to the Beat hasn't started yet.

2333
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:20,920
Oh, okay.

2334
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:21,720
These are different.

2335
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,520
These are different.

2336
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,200
Dark Weeks, unfortunately,

2337
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,360
because I was like, oh, who's there when we're there?

2338
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:26,760
Okay.

2339
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,680
It doesn't seem, maybe I'm wrong

2340
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,520
or there's a different like filler acts,

2341
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,840
but I was a little disappointed that we didn't get

2342
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,560
because it's so fun.

2343
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,320
That's one of my favorite things to do

2344
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,160
because I texted you a couple of weeks ago

2345
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,920
of who was there.

2346
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,960
I couldn't believe.

2347
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,480
And you were so thrilled.

2348
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,840
Yes, I don't.

2349
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,280
Look, it's hard to defend,

2350
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,480
but Chicago ended up meaning a lot to me

2351
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,920
from my dad, from my wife,

2352
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,240
and getting a blast of 25 or 64,

2353
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,240
ending every single set of the three.

2354
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,760
You did the exact same set every time.

2355
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,800
So yeah, I don't know.

2356
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,720
That's what Epcot rocks.

2357
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:04,920
Epcot rocks.

2358
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,840
And we will post,

2359
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,320
we'll post photos of you and I contemplating life.

2360
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:09,720
Oh yeah, we have those.

2361
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:13,240
Having spiritual moments along at the Epcot Lagoon

2362
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,400
right after this had transpired.

2363
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,320
But thank you for letting us come back

2364
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,440

2365
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,920

Jason, will you go on Rip Ride Rocket with me?

2372
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,720
Uh, I don't, uh, maybe.

2373
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,000
Sounds like a no.

2374
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,760
Will you, okay, how about this?

2375
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:46,760
Will you eat a steak with me in Orlando?

2376
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,760
In Orlando?

2377
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,880
Yeah, yeah.

2378
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:50,440
I don't know.

2379
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,200
Beef hasn't really greened with evil

2380
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,080
in the last couple of years.

2381
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,040
Answer the question.

2382
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:55,320
That much.

2383
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,240
Can we just get.

2384
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,280
He's been so happy.

2385
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,960
Just say yes even if we don't do it.

2386
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:00,760
Yeah, yeah.

2387
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,040
Lie to me, lie to me.

2388
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,320
And now say the name of the singer.

2389
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,080
What?

2390
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,440
Oh, uh.

2391
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,080
Say it.

2392
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,880
Phoebe Bridges.

2393
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,520
