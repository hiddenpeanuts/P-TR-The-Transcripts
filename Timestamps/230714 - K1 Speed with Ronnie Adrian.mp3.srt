1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Vroom, vroom, the following podcast contains tight fitting helmets, a tournament of teens,

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,880
high school lies, and aggro carboys reminiscing about burning rubber.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,440
All this plus Ronnie Adrian joins us to talk K1 speed indoor go-kart racing on today's podcast,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,000
The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,960
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who are only comfortable

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,040
driving if the vehicle has a human face.

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,120
My name is Michael Carlson.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,800
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,600
Did your vehicles have a human face?

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
No, I'm saying-

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Stomach?

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
No, that's why we weren't comfortable.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
We were curious about the whole thing.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Right, yeah.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Scott Garner's here and he wasn't comfortable either.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
No, of course.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
I needed to have a name.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Maybe I need to have seen that car up to some hijinks.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,200
I need to have heard a catchphrase the car has said, like, ka-chow.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Or else I'm like, I don't know if I can trust this car.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Yeah, I know.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I feel the exact same way.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
We are talking about today go-karts, essentially.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
A specific one, but also in general, I think.

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,080
I think this is a great place to put all of the go-kart thoughts we've all had our whole

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
lives.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,440
I don't know, we could get a lot of different go-kart episodes because there are different

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
companies, you know?

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Sure.

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,840
Well, let's not get into specifics about boomers, about the chain boomers and their go-karts

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
because I'm not qualified.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,720
I've never done a boomer's go-kart.

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
But we've done K1 now, I'll tell you that.

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
It could be way different, but let's bring our guest in.

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,960
He's an actor, he's an improviser, he's a musician, he's a writer.

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
He's a lot of things.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
He's Ronnie Adrian.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Hello!

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Hey!

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Whoa.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,960
I like to give a little space for people to clap.

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I love that one.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Or be surprised.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
People will be surprised.

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,480
They're listening, they're like, I don't want to know who the guest is.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm going to be surprised when they tell me.

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,440
And then they hear my name and if they've ever heard of me, they go, whoa, him, yes,

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
I like him.

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,000
And I'm assuming that they like me.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,560
They've heard of me and they like me.

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,680
And that was short, though.

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,840
I think they would give you a longer applause.

56
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,160
I guess it's more for the people who clasp their hands on their face, a home alone style,

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
like, oh!

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Oh, it's a gasp space.

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Oh, they're shocked.

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Oh, okay.

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
It's more like a shock.

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
They got him?

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,240
That's what it is.

64
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,960
That's smart because they do that in the editing of a Marvel movie, like Captain America,

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,300
he gets Thor's hammer and they leave a pause in for the theater to applaud.

66
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,800
So that's basically the same thing.

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,600
And we should tell every guest now going forward to do that, to leave in the hammer

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
applause.

69
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Oh, sure.

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah, the hammer applause, of course.

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,080
We assume that there's listeners who get together for midnight screen.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
When these episodes drop.

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
They do drop at midnight.

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
They do drop at midnight.

75
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
We put them out at midnight.

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,040
So we assume that there's a contingent of listeners out there who all gather, rent a

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,480
theater at their own expense so they can experience each episode.

78
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
Every week.

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Midnight on the West Coast.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
On the East Coast, it's 3 a.m.

81
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, so they all got to do the 3 a.m. screenings.

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
They hit up a diner.

83
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,920
Not even the cultiest cult movie does a 3 a.m. screening, but this podcast, we know they're

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
doing it.

85
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Yeah.

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,280
And if Jason, like, yeah, these are people that dress up as the different meats that

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,160
Jason talks about from the East Coast.

88
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Oh, OK.

89
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,600
Well, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

90
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
The hard cores.

91
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,920
I mean, and hopefully everybody is as intuitive as everybody else.

92
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,240
You hate going to those movie theaters and you're sitting there and you're like, you're

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,280
the first one to start to clap and immediately realize that no one else is on board.

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,040
They're like, we're all just regular watches.

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
You're like a super fan.

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,080
You're you've missed the super fan screening.

97
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,240
Yeah. So it's like, oh, yeah.

98
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,400
And this is like that slow, that that quick Peter out.

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,920
That's like, ah, you tried.

100
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,240
Yeah. You know what I've thought about that a lot with is the because we are we are now

101
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:12,200
firmly in the world where nobody freaks out at the Nicole Kidman AMC intro.

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,560
There was a time where you went and then it got this whoop.

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,600
It were like you were giving it all this energy.

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,880
And then I missed the transition at some.

105
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,520
But now you go and it gets nothing.

106
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,640
Everybody agreed. We had our fun with that.

107
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,440
We don't do it anymore. It's just there.

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,480
And I kind of wish I'd seen something in the middle where somebody, like you said,

109
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
was left flailing.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
They did the craziest, fakest scream and then her left and everybody's just glaring.

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,200
Well, I want to actually honestly, I think some people are still trying to keep it alive.

112
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,360
I got to maybe I've been in the wrong screen.

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,480
I have AMC pass, so I go to the movies pretty frequently.

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,040
And there's still some where I'm like, oh, you're it depends on the thing.

115
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,640
But I would just had a movie the other day and it was like the movie Pass Lives.

116
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,200
And so it's like one of those sort of like more independent sort of just like, here's

117
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,320
a story. Here's a nice story we're telling with, you know, that unfold and sort of thing.

118
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,320
And that crowd was not the crowd that cheers for the Nicole Kidman.

119
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,520
It was very silent when she came onto the screen.

120
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,720
But I've been to one maybe like even just as much as two weeks ago where somebody was

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,720
like, whoo. And then everyone's just like, yeah, we'll give it to you.

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,360
And this was like, it's usually over.

123
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
They're usually overzealous.

124
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,800
Like you could tell, like, oh, yeah, like you're the like you're you're probably not

125
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,960
funny in real life.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
Yeah, you're like but you're like the fun friend, you know, like you're applying your

127
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,600
foot. Like I'm extracting my like comedic value from this thing.

128
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,200
Right. I know this this thing's funny and I know it's funny.

129
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,520
So I'm funny. Right.

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,960
Yeah. It gives it gives them a chance, though, to be funny, maybe.

131
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,400
So I think it's a positive thing.

132
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,640
Right. I mean, it gives them a chance to sort of be like the life of the theater for.

133
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Yes. You know, like, oh, yeah, sure.

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
I would I would never do that.

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,360
But yeah, I guess I'm not bothered that you're doing it.

136
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,960
I can't do it. But like the funniest thing I've ever seen in the family of this is

137
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,600
at a wrestling show, past guest Nick Mundy tried to start an ironic USA chant at a

138
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
wrestling show and he got booed so fast by the entire audience.

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,480
It was like USA twice and there's boo everyone booing him.

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,640
And I was like, that is not what he was looking for.

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,280
Well, this is I've been in places where he's done similar things and it worked.

142
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,200
But this but that is pre 2016.

143
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,040
I don't know what year we're talking around 2016.

144
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,080
The USA chant became a very undesirable.

145
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,880
I think the irony was clear maybe in 2014.

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,200
And now it's like somebody's chanting USA.

147
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
They might kill us.

148
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,200
We got to get this guy out of here, maybe out of the state.

149
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,720
It's a good question. I'll have to.

150
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
I can't remember. I feel it was around the same.

151
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,840
It was around this time, maybe before, though.

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
I'll ask him, although he probably has erased it from his mind.

153
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,800
What are you talking about?

154
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
That didn't happen. Never the boot ever.

155
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
No. Crazy.

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
I chanted. Everything's good.

157
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
I chanted a different chant.

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,320
So, Ronnie, you're on the podcast.

159
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,880
We could talk real briefly about this because you sent me an email a couple of months ago

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
and you were wishing me a happy birthday.

161
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,040
And I immediately said, oh, man, I like Ronnie so much I haven't seen him.

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm going to do what every adult does to hang out.

163
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,360
I said, you should got it. You got to come on the podcast.

164
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,400
And I immediately after like 10 emails back and forth to try to figure out a topic,

165
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,880
I felt really bad about it.

166
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,920
It was a lot of back and forth, a lot of back and forth for sure.

167
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
And it was like, oh, you got to come on the podcast.

168
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,480
I was like, OK, great. And then it's like, well, what do you here?

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
Like, what have you done?

170
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,000
Or like, what are these things that you could do that could be on the podcast?

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,360
I gave him all the parameters, you know, you guys know the parameter.

172
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,920
We've done this dance before. We've lost people.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,640
I know people stop responding.

174
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm happy Ronnie's here.

175
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,600
Yes, it took forever. I know.

176
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,880
And then I was like, I don't want to like keep sending emails immediately back.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Like, no, not this isn't right.

178
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,360
I was like, all this stuff you're talking about, we can talk about.

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
We're just trying to find a thing that's like a theme thing.

180
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
And you were like, what about the tram tour?

181
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,960
And I was like, well, we're going to do a tram tour thing.

182
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,000
So all you listeners know, they curate for you all so,

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,960
so well, because there was a real thin line dance that I was going through

184
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,200
with Mike for a while about, well, they kind of like this.

185
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh, we know they're not our fans are really not.

186
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,640
So just know that you're at top of mind

187
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,160
a lot of the times when they're

188
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
curating these show topics for you.

189
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,560
Oh, man.

190
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,840
And then you got other shows that are like, hey, come on and do whatever you want.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,120
No, no parameters.

192
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
Sorry. So bad.

193
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,560
It's rules and parameters. The show is where you sit.

194
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,640
Oh, I was going to say, look, we're all we're all just trying to put out

195
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,400
a good podcast and also slowly drive ourselves and say, you know,

196
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,600
and the people we know drive ourselves mad with rules

197
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,480
that we have solely imposed on our that we're doing this to ourselves.

198
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,160
And mind you, I want to let it I wasn't frustrated by it or anything,

199
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,280
but it is it is funny to sort of be like, all right, well,

200
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm going to do what you're asking me to the best of what I think you're asking me.

201
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,560
So this thing and it's still like, no, it's like it's like

202
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:25,560
it's like being in math class and the answer is four and you go for

203
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,400
and they go show your work and you're like, well, this thing and it's like,

204
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,360
that's not the work.

205
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,960
And it's like, what are you talking about?

206
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
But the answer is four.

207
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,080
It's like not for our audience is not for it's four,

208
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,840
but it's not the four that you're doing when we're the fact that we like.

209
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

210
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,240
Yeah, the fact that we end up often at like,

211
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,840
oh, yeah, come on our show. You can talk about whatever you want.

212
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,520
It would help if you went to Disney World in 1993

213
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,520
and saw this one specific animatronic show that was open for three months

214
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,920
and was not liked.

215
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
People didn't know about it.

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,880
And actually, it wasn't even publicized.

217
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,080
If you were even at Disney World, you might have missed it entirely.

218
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,840
So anyway, are there any of those that you would like to talk about?

219
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,760
And really any of them?

220
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
There's a completely open end.

221
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,480
Yeah. I mean, your pitch should be

222
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,120
have you been to a theme park and also the niche,

223
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,320
the niche theme park or the niche ride, the better.

224
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
Oh, yeah. What about this thing?

225
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,400
It's like, ah, rather, we've kind of already done it.

226
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,640
Oh, we're thinking about doing that, but in a bigger way.

227
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,680
So give us something else.

228
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,760
And you're like, well, OK, I guess one time

229
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,120
I went to this place when I was young and they had you riding slugs.

230
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,320
And you're like, riding slugs.

231
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,520
I don't know if that fits the parameters of what we do.

232
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,280
What do you want? What do you want?

233
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,880
I love this. If you if we skipped out on a slug ride,

234
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
there was no slug ride.

235
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,280
There was no there was no slug ride.

236
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm not crazy. I would have.

237
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,800
It leaves it leaves like a trail of slime behind you.

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
And then they let you great idea.

239
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
You can take a vial of the slime home.

240
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,720
And then I showed it to her.

241
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,120
That was my show and tell when I got back to school.

242
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah, this is real slugs.

243
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,360
That's a great idea.

244
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
Well, I'm sorry we made you do taxes.

245
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,040
Yeah, it's true.

246
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,160
It is true. It's truly OK.

247
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,520
That's I mean, this has been a long journey, everybody.

248
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,360
You should know that there's been lots of noncommunication in between.

249
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
So Mike said too much, but I feel like it was at least three or four.

250
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,840
It's been a while. It's been a while.

251
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,680
I'm glad it happened because Scott said there's been people who just stop

252
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,240
responding to us.

253
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, yeah. Thank you for eventually.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
Yeah. We're picking it back up eventually.

255
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,960
And here I am.

256
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,360
And now here I am on one of the best podcasts about theme rides or whatever.

257
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,680
Whatever this is, whatever it is we're doing.

258
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
We don't even know anymore.

259
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,800
You hit on a great topic.

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,520
This is a great topic.

261
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,000
I was like, do you have any thoughts, though, on the tram tour

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,800
you wanted to get out?

263
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,920
Because we could talk tram real quick or not even quick.

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,720
I mean, the only I have nothing interesting to add about it.

265
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,360
Sure. As just I was on the ride because it was like

266
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,640
we were gifted.

267
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,440
I was in a room and we were gifted the the show running one to go like

268
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,080
for our last sort of excursion together as like a group.

269
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,720
Let's do the tour.

270
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,120
And so we did the tour.

271
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,680
You were like this.

272
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
It was when you were working on the lot, like you're saying, record.

273
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,640
Yeah. So we were working on the universal lot.

274
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,680
So it was like, well, let's do the thing.

275
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,760
And then to his credit, they didn't give us just because we were on the lot.

276
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,600
They didn't kind of go, well, because you're like employees on our lot.

277
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Of course you can get the ride for free.

278
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
They were still like, no, you have to pay.

279
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,840
So like so the show runner was very nice enough to pay for everybody,

280
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,040
which I couldn't have been cheap.

281
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,800
And so we rode on the ride.

282
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,000
And I just remember being.

283
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,680
I remember everything feeling so much smaller than what it was in movies,

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,680
because it would be like, well, this is where they did the jaws thing.

285
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,800
And I was like this.

286
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,160
It was like the size of this backyard, maybe even smaller.

287
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,080
You know, like this is the lake that Jaws was in.

288
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,000
You're like, what?

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,640
And there's like and this is where they shot this particular scene.

290
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,840
And you're like, this is like it really showed you how the magic of movies.

291
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,800
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

292
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,920
Like there was but some stuff didn't make me go.

293
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,400
They have the part where it's like this is the this is the iconic

294
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,800
scene area for like one of those movies of like a war of the world.

295
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,000
And I remember it because I then went home later and watched it

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,520
just to be like, I saw that in real life.

297
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,040
I saw this thing that looked like this and I saw it like that,

298
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,800
because, you know, it doesn't it's not cinematic when you actually see it in person.

299
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,560
You're like, yeah, this just looks kind of like in the movies.

300
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,360
It's like, oh, my God, it looks.

301
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,560
Oh, my gosh.

302
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
So that was my thought.

303
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,800
My thought was that people who make movies are.

304
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
They they they work, they do wonders.

305
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
You're so is Hollywood.

306
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah, Hollywood is mad.

307
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah, it worked on you.

308
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
Yeah, it worked on me.

309
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,080
So obviously you made a good choice of being like, no, we're going to do that.

310
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,480
Maybe I said that you just were I wanted to make a point

311
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,280
about how the magic of the movies were good.

312
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,800
Yeah. So if everybody's listening, who was getting disheartened with movies,

313
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,280
just know that the magic still exists.

314
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah. Well, that's good.

315
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah. And you see, you feel the magic when you go to the places

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,280
where the movies were made and are underwhelmed.

317
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,920
And you really feel like, wow,

318
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,680
I guess movies are good.

319
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
This is all. Yeah, this is awful.

320
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,160
It truly is being like, here is this set that has also been used in.

321
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,480
And then they give off like 50 things and you're like, oh, yeah.

322
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
Like, of course, that's how that works.

323
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,160
They have a property and they kind of go, yeah, let's just redress this property

324
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,920
and use it in like 50 things.

325
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,040
And you're like, but they're all like, think.

326
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,560
But like of those 50, 25 are being like, I've seen 25, all 25 of those things.

327
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,160
And I never thought that this was the same place that was in this thing.

328
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,840
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

329
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,480
You start to the more you like, because I did that.

330
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,600
I was on the train. I did the tram.

331
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
It was a guide, a guide on the tram tour.

332
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,080
And then I worked at the Warner Brothers lot and would take big walks

333
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,600
where I end up on that like Gilmore Girls Town Square.

334
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,280
And certain what I think it's just just if you spent time at these places,

335
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,640
you start to see through the met, you suddenly are like this.

336
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,640
What's it called? Stars Hollow?

337
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,080
Is that correct? Yeah.

338
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,400
Suddenly you're just everything you're what it's Stars Hollow again.

339
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,680
I've seen Stars Hollow in every movie I've seen this year.

340
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
You just suddenly start like that.

341
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,720
That's that one movie theater on the Universal.

342
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,560
A lot. Yeah, I know, because the street bends this way.

343
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,400
But but a regular person is not doing that.

344
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,760
What it's it's ruined movies for me. Yeah.

345
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,440
Now I can't just watch something and relax.

346
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
I'm like, I know what this is.

347
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,840
You purpose this thing.

348
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,960
Well, surprise, everybody.

349
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,160
This has turned into an argument podcast where me and Scott go back

350
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,760
and forth about the magic of movie.

351
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,960
I think there's still magic.

352
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,280
Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this.

353
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,840
Whoo. Yeah.

354
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,560
I'm still cheering for it.

355
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

356
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
OK. Well, let's go.

357
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,640
OK, then let's go on to the real topic here today.

358
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,760
The big themed experience.

359
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,200
K one speed go kart track

360
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,880
that are many.

361
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,120
There are many locations across the world, 63 locations across the country.

362
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,240
The country. Can you believe it, Ronnie?

363
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,400
Can you say when you were thinking when you were laboring over this,

364
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,320
when you thought, OK, I forget what I said specifically of like,

365
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,640
is there any like experience type thing you had?

366
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,560
And you were like, I guess I went on a go kart once. Right.

367
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
Yeah, that was what it was.

368
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,120
I went I had went on it this year solely because

369
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,960
I. Me and my girlfriend, we had.

370
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,440
We had went there because she was like, oh, let's go to this thing one time

371
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,240
because it was right by our house.

372
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,040
You know, she wanted to do something outside the house.

373
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,640
And I was I'm always like, we could just stay home.

374
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,280
He's like, let's do something outside the house.

375
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,160
And so, so we went to this place

376
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,280
and immediately you go in and we're going to we're going to do the go kart

377
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,400
or whatever. And so we're kind of like in the lay of the land.

378
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,480
So we go into the game room area.

379
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,840
And I don't know if all 63 locations are like this.

380
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,720
Maybe other ones are like, we're we're like we have like a total barcade.

381
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,360
And this one does not.

382
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,480
It's essentially like there's a pool table in there.

383
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,680
That's like maybe one or two pool tables, maybe like a ice hockey table or something

384
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
to video games.

385
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,760
And then like maybe like it's like not basketball.

386
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
You get some basketball.

387
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,040
There's not much going on in the game room.

388
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,440
You know, it's funny, Scott and I went actually literally yesterday to do this.

389
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,920
And I had no expectations.

390
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,080
So I was very impressed by the arcade.

391
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,560
I was like, wow, look at this.

392
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,480
Look, we've got a magic thing all over.

393
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,880
Yeah, we're having the same discussion.

394
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,720
Sees it differently.

395
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,080
I we walked out. I was like, look at this place.

396
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,280
I thought they just have one thing, but look at this.

397
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,480
We could and this is five minutes away.

398
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,840
Yeah. Wow.

399
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
So, you know, I mean, don't get me wrong.

400
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,320
We had fun still in the thing.

401
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
And then we didn't get a chance to even ride the go-karts

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,840
because it was a weekend and it was like really sort of a lot of people.

403
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,800
It's like a lot of people coming in.

404
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,280
We were like, yeah. And then we were like,

405
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,040
they were making they were basically saying,

406
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,880
you have to wait like an hour or something if you want to get on the rain.

407
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,960
We were like, oh, you know, and I was like, I don't.

408
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,080
On top of the fact that I didn't really want to be here in the first place,

409
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,840
like I don't really want to wait an hour.

410
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,360
And she also agreed.

411
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,680
And so we left.

412
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,360
But then for my birthday, they just because we have to sign up still.

413
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,120
Yeah. To even be so you have to sign up to even be able to get on the ride.

414
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,560
Basically. So we signed up.

415
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,160
And so when my birthday was in March, they were just like,

416
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,320
they emailed me like, hey, you get a free ride because your birthday.

417
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,440
And so I went, OK.

418
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,280
And I just went one day and you know, yeah, I went alone.

419
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,560
OK. It just one day.

420
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,960
And then I was like, I'm just going to go use this ride real quick

421
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
before I had something else to do.

422
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,560
And then so I did that.

423
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,560
And then you were like, and then as fate would have it,

424
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
then I harassed you.

425
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,720
You came calling and I was like, well, I did this thing and

426
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,000
just did a go cart.

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Yeah, perfect.

428
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,720
So did you let's just like your initial response,

429
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,040
like reaction to it was like, I love the good.

430
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,560
Do you like it? Was it fun?

431
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,640
Would you do it again? I mean,

432
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,240
I would I would do it again.

433
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,680
But if I'm paying for it, I would do it again,

434
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,440
probably with other people that like we're all racing, like doing it alone is fine,

435
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
especially when it's free.

436
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,520
But I'm not the person that just goes to the park and buy them something.

437
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,280
Be like, let me just race a bunch of strangers.

438
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,640
You know what I mean?

439
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,280
But yeah, no, I this was our concern going into it was like,

440
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,600
I how can we do this to avoid stranger?

441
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,680
Because I think what we did not want is teenagers.

442
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,440
Like we are now there are a bunch of strange teenagers trying to bump us.

443
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,320
Yeah, the I was worried about teens, basically.

444
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,840
Teens were my biggest concern.

445
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,160
Well, what were you think they were going to do?

446
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,200
Make fun of me.

447
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,080
Hmm. Yeah.

448
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,400
Race faster than us.

449
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,360
Bump us. Try to hurt us.

450
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Get it. Taunt us on the way in.

451
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,640
In the form of the language we use that's outdated.

452
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah, say that the things that were the phrases that seem new to us

454
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,560
have actually been said for 20 years.

455
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,160
Yeah. And is this before you actually get on, get into the car

456
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,280
or this while you're driving?

457
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,880
This is the night before I'm worried that all this stuff is going to happen.

458
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,000
What I'm saying is, when you're worrying that this is they're going to do this stuff

459
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,240
to you beforehand.

460
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,800
Yeah, when are they going to bother you in this scenario?

461
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,960
Probably beforehand.

462
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,840
But if we're on the track, they're going to do the sort of aggressive stuff

463
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
while we're racing. That's my concern.

464
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,200
And I think they will stop us, T-bonus,

465
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,800
maybe create a little cul-de-sac with their cars.

466
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,840
So the race is stopped so that they can point at us and call out specific flaws,

467
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
then keep going.

468
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,760
Yeah.

469
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,800
And also, you guys, I see some gray hairs there.

470
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
OK. And then they keep trying.

471
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,560
I think they're going to take every opportunity.

472
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,120
Yeah, I really didn't know what to expect.

473
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,000
I was wondering, because we went right at opening and I was like,

474
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,320
is it going to be empty in here or is it going to be like groups of teens,

475
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,440
like teen race groups are all kind of hanging out, ready to go,

476
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,400
or they dress sort of like the Warriors?

477
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,440
Teen racing. Teen race groups.

478
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,240
Burbank teen race groups are all waiting to race.

479
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,000
And then there's these two older men who come in who are novices

480
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,880
and they don't know the ropes of this.

481
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,640
Don't you know noon is our time?

482
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,600
Noon is teen race group time.

483
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,840
I feel like that's something to maybe consider if

484
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
the rides are like ten dollars a go-kart ride,

485
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
then maybe you get some street toughs in there that's like,

486
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,520
we're here to cause trouble and ride fast.

487
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,840
But when the ride is like forty five dollars for one ride or something.

488
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,720
It's oddly a single ride. Yes, it was pricey.

489
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,120
But you can get an annual pass to this place.

490
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,960
So maybe if the teens are thinking smart economically, they can just get.

491
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,320
They'll get an annual pass and they have nothing but time.

492
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,520
So they can wait 90 minutes to two hours to do a single go-kart race.

493
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,640
And they can hassle a couple of dads while they're waiting.

494
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,880
Well, let's describe for the listener what the Burbank, what it's like.

495
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,600
Because again, I was I was kind of I didn't know what it was going to be.

496
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,560
It's kind of a big warehouse in the middle by the old.

497
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,000
It's by the Aldi and Burbank.

498
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
It's by the Burger King from Back to the Future.

499
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,520
If that helps you on victory.

500
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,720
I would imagine that's some that's some how I imagine.

501
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,560
Oh, yeah. I had no clue.

502
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, yeah. Watch back future.

503
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,880
And Marty comes out, he skateboards right in front of that Burger King.

504
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,440
Oh, I got it. OK. All right.

505
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,080
I didn't know. So recreate the shot with your phone.

506
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,480
So you go and it's like a big warehouse and there's a big, you know, go-kart track.

507
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,120
And it's a lot like more like updated.

508
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
There's parts of it that look almost like a gastropub or something,

509
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,680
like with the lights and like the there's counters.

510
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,160
And you're talking about the paddock lounge.

511
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,480
I am talking about the paddock lounge. Right.

512
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,600
The place where you can eat. It's a full service restaurant.

513
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Yeah, it is. Yes.

514
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,760
And this, by the way, this is not the first owner of the go-kart track.

515
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,320
Of the whole thing or of the whole thing.

516
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,440
Was that location a different go-kart?

517
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,360
Yes, it was.

518
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,120
It was called Racers Edge.

519
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,920
And I learned this because I went yesterday as well after we recorded.

520
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,760
I just walked around because I was like, wait, you went and didn't race.

521
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,720
No, I didn't race at all.

522
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
And I went.

523
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Wow. New episode title, Jason's Walk Through.

524
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,000
I walked through.

525
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,880
Did you walk the track? Go-kart place.

526
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,520
You walk the track.

527
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,440
I just walked.

528
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,040
I kind of walked in and walked around.

529
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,880
And my memory, it was a lot more low key at race when it was Racers Edge.

530
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,760
That seems crazy because that name is so edgy.

531
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,160
It is. Yes.

532
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,440
And I was like, oh, I'll just go in,

533
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,160
play a couple of dollars on the Iron Maiden pinball machine.

534
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,560
I remember.

535
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,040
And then I'll leave.

536
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
And that was not an option.

537
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,560
There is no pinball anymore.

538
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,960
There is a kind of weirdly spaced out game room where you have to get a game card.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,640
This is a thing at our kids now.

540
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,520
Tickets. Yeah, because you can get like tickets and redeem them from prizes.

541
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,120
Wait, guys, speaking of old man, it's been game cards for like a decade plus.

542
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,920
What are you? Right.

543
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,400
No, you're right.

544
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,040
Thing now where there's a card that you this has been the case.

545
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,360
I know, but it's so long.

546
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,400
It's so. Excuse me.

547
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,440
I would much rather just use tokens.

548
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,280
How do we? I got some.

549
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,120
I like the feel. It's tactile.

550
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,640
You know, I want to put my money in a machine.

551
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,480
Then they give me a different money back that I get to use only in these machines.

552
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,800
I want currency that does nothing for me.

553
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,160
Orders, tokens.

554
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,120
The teens, the teens now are using the tokens to throw at older men. Yeah.

555
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,000
This is what I'm afraid about that they hear over here like, oh, it's game cards

556
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
these days. Yeah.

557
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,280
What has happened to the go card industry?

558
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,240
Two teams now.

559
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Now the teens, they they somehow hear that from the go card track.

560
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,240
Get the cards to do a launch into the arcade.

561
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,240
Let's crash into him here.

562
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,960
I'll make my car a ramp.

563
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
You drive over me.

564
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,680
But for the purpose of this, the only the thing that I will say about

565
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,360
game cards specifically in this instance is to make somebody get a game card

566
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,200
for a room that has not even 10 games.

567
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,920
Yeah, it seems a little bit.

568
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
A little bit. That is true.

569
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,480
Yes. They're counting on you buying it and not using all the money you spend.

570
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Like, that's the thing with game cards.

571
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,160
It's like, oh, we'll get a little more money out of them and they'll they'll not use

572
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,080
they'll lose the card. The fools.

573
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,720
They'll lose the card, probably for sure. Yeah.

574
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,200
I would like to go back to you knew this pinball machine when it was racers edge.

575
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,600
Were you a frequenter of racer racers?

576
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,240
No, I went with like an old sketch group of mine.

577
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,640
I think Avery Monson was with us and and it wasn't K1 back then.

578
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,120
It wasn't K1. It opened five years ago.

579
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,160
Something like that. Yeah.

580
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,800
It opened in like 2011 as racers edge.

581
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,440
And then I found the racers at Facebook page.

582
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,400
And the last entry said March 18th, 2020.

583
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,080
For the safety of our guests and our employees, we are closing due to the COVID-19

584
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,720
pandemic. Oh, and then racers edge never reopened.

585
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,560
Did you race at racers edge?

586
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,240
I did race a few times. Oh, you did.

587
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,520
So you got in the car then? Yeah, I got in the car then.

588
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,120
So you were just respecting the legacy of racers edge by not respecting

589
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,160
the legacy of racing at K1.

590
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,120
I don't trust this new brand.

591
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
Yeah. I don't know. Are they edgy or not?

592
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,200
The the other thing that stuck out, the original play was that

593
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,240
racers edge was trying to crowd fund a laser tag arena.

594
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,480
Oh, that'd be awesome. Yeah.

595
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
To pay money to know that I helped fund this.

596
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,720
What do you get? What are the rewards for crowdfunding a laser tag arena?

597
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,080
Free go kart races and a few like free laser tag.

598
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,560
I thought you were going to just say, I think free go kart racing can be like,

599
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,800
so you don't even get to use the laser tag?

600
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,520
You can't use it.

601
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,760
I believe this space that they were trying to make laser tag is now the game room

602
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
and they expanded the track at some point. Oh, OK.

603
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,800
So the track's a little bigger than it used to be.

604
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,400
I have one more question.

605
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,960
Why did you think the Iron Maiden machine would be there, even though it's new owners?

606
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,800
I didn't know it was new owners.

607
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,920
I was like, oh, this place looks different.

608
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,720
So when we said K1, the place by Burbank, you thought of racers edge.

609
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,360
Yeah, no, I thought that I see the name and I just forgot the name.

610
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,960
I see. OK. Because I didn't know there were competing go kart

611
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,240
comfort like that, like a giant chain would take over an old like.

612
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,080
Well, this is like the Walmart of go kart companies just absorbing

613
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,840
everything in its wake, I feel like.

614
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,680
Yeah. It takes over

615
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,080
because of all the locations.

616
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,480
And I don't know, do we know what does racers edge even functioning at all?

617
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,680
I don't think it exists.

618
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,080
Oh, rest in peace, racers edge.

619
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,520
Oh, man. Yeah.

620
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,440
I think that was the one location.

621
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,480
Racers edge, the mom and pop of go kart.

622
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
The mom and pop basically.

623
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,080
By big K1 speed.

624
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,400
K1 is bumping the other competitors off the track.

625
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,240
Man.

626
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,600
So, yeah, so we go in there and it's a big, big place, obviously,

627
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,480
because you have to have a track.

628
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,440
I was thinking the track would be bigger, honestly.

629
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,880
It was a little smaller than in my mind. Really?

630
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,000
It was so narrow to me.

631
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,240
Well, like, I kind of didn't understand how anybody like you're maybe one

632
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,880
one racer can pass another, maybe.

633
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,760
But if you're if that thing's packed, how is anybody getting through?

634
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,520
That seems like that was my city.

635
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,960
I was so nervous for so many reasons.

636
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,760
And I haven't even revealed all the reasons I was nervous yet.

637
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,720
That's what my podcast is mostly about.

638
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,120
I know what you were coming in with.

639
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,400
I like Jason taking a leisurely stroll.

640
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,520
I want to make sure that our discussion of the racing part

641
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,480
doesn't preclude Jason from talking about his stroll.

642
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,760
Keep chipping in the straw.

643
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,640
Trematic memories to talk about, too.

644
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,000
Don't worry. OK.

645
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
I've got a dramatic.

646
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,200
Don't focus on that so much that it distracts from the stroll. Yeah.

647
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,640
Well, even just to Jason's point earlier, when he said that, oh, they

648
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,720
they the game room and expanded the track, I thought they expanded the track.

649
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,840
So it was smaller than that before, because like you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

650
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,040
Like I could see where they I could see the area probably being like

651
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,520
where they had expanded being thinking like, oh, yeah, I see that

652
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,480
they could have expanded that particular area

653
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,120
because it feels like this feels different than what everything else is.

654
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,920
But if you were just right, you were basically riding around in a circle.

655
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,240
And if if yes, if racers edge was that was smaller than what it is now.

656
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,080
Racers edge is like the bear in the little car in a circus.

657
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,120
You just drive in a circle over and over again.

658
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,920
Keep it steady.

659
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,400
I guess it's more like NASCAR, though, I suppose,

660
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,480
because NASCAR, you're just going in a big oval.

661
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,160
Oh, so you always I don't think that's necessarily always the case.

662
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,320
I don't know. Does NASCAR have different stuff?

663
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,560
Is NASCAR different than the did they have to do?

664
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,400
Do you know, didn't they just do or are about to do

665
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,520
that you were a race through the streets of Chicago?

666
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,920
That's Formula One. Oh, OK. OK. Yeah.

667
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,800
NASCAR. All right. OK. Yeah.

668
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,280
I was worried I didn't know NASCAR.

669
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,720
And this is more akin to Formula One than NASCAR.

670
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,920
F1. What's got K1? K1.

671
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,120
Yeah, K1. K1 is like K1. K1 is like F1 for sure.

672
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,800
It seems like depending on the location of these places,

673
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,920
they'll either have a Formula One car or a NASCAR car.

674
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,320
Like as a branding, like as like, oh, look, here's a car.

675
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,760
You can take your picture. Oh, yeah.

676
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,200
Which one was this? Or like shit on the walls.

677
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah. Well, this this one has speaking of shit on the walls.

678
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,560
This one has like, how would you describe this

679
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,840
like sort of trend in restaurants where it's like kind of a fake brush

680
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,120
sort of like leaves on a wall and then there's a neon sign

681
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,040
that says ended up at K1.

682
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,960
Do you know what I'm talking about?

683
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,520
What? That's like an Instagram.

684
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
Yeah. Ended up in K1.

685
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Yes. Oh, look at this.

686
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,400
Oh, right. OK.

687
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,520
It's a very like trendy thing to have it like, again, like a gastropub

688
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,120
or some sort of a restaurant or something.

689
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,360
But it is interesting.

690
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,000
I sent this picture to Jade, my girlfriend, and she was like,

691
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,920
Oh, an Instagram wall. You hate that shit.

692
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
She's right. It's a little exhausting.

693
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,960
You hate a neon sign against some fake leaves?

694
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
No, I love neon.

695
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,920
I love but the fake or real greenery like a wall.

696
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,880
A fake shrub.

697
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,680
You don't like any.

698
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,240
We don't. We like fake rocks.

699
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,440
We don't like indoor fake shrubs.

700
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,120
That's not true.

701
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
I know that's what he's said.

702
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,320
That's that's Jason.

703
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,400
I think it's just it's just like when everywhere it just has like the sign.

704
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,720
Do you think it's a cursive?

705
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
Do you not care for the cursive aspect of the neon?

706
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,480
I mean, because that makes it try to look a little fancy.

707
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,160
Ended up at K1.

708
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,560
Well, it means you ended up at the K1 speedway.

709
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,440
I guess.

710
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,800
I mean, it's like your day took an exciting turn.

711
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,680
How do you feel about that type of Instagrammable wall?

712
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,960
I mean, ended up at K1 just makes it feel like it was an accident.

713
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,240
It's like, well, just ended up at K1.

714
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,680
Like, I think maybe they should think about how they want to brand themselves.

715
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Yeah. Yeah. Great to be at K1.

716
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,080
It's like, oh, maybe that doesn't have a better flow,

717
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,560
but you want to make it seem like it was intentional that they came.

718
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,360
Drag to K1.

719
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,520
And it's not like because that's kind of that's what you text somebody

720
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,600
when you there's not a very exciting night afoot.

721
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,840
And you just went to that bar that is acceptable and close.

722
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,360
What happened? Ended up at K1.

723
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,160
It's like, oh, yeah.

724
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,680
Well, then I'm going to call it then.

725
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,960
I'm not. Yeah, I won't see you there.

726
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,760
Drank too much White Claws at the Paddock restaurant.

727
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,960
Drove a little gasoline bomb.

728
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,360
Also, to say restaurant at that place is very much a stretch.

729
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,120
Stretch for sure.

730
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,840
Yeah, when you said full, it is a full service restaurant.

731
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,560
Using their language, using their

732
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,440
just in that they have appetizers, sandwiches and like desserts.

733
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,600
I think the menu is full.

734
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,040
The pizza, the menu is very full, but it is basically like a counter

735
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,240
at a movie theater, smaller than that, actually.

736
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,920
Yeah. The most AMC's.

737
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Again, when I was there before, it was like a snack bar

738
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,560
where you can see the entire like side of the soda fountain.

739
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,560
You know, you can see the tanks and stuff. What?

740
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
What does that mean?

741
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,760
Like a soda fountain at like the Little League, like Clubhouse, you know?

742
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,920
I actually don't know. I don't.

743
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,160
Are you just are you saying that you could see inside of the soda fountain

744
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,240
in the sense that you could see the walking by the soda fountain

745
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,240
because it's on the other side of where you buy tickets?

746
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,240
You know, it's right next to the cash register.

747
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,360
You're seeing like the tubs of syrup that go into making soda.

748
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,960
Yeah, yeah. Like you see the canisters, the tubs and the tubes out.

749
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,880
Yeah, it's just because it just used to be a fucking counter

750
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,760
with like, you know, it was not as silly.

751
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,240
Yeah, it wasn't as they weren't as worried about Instagrammable.

752
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
Right. All moments. Right.

753
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,640
Moments. Yeah. OK.

754
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,800
So it sounds like it got better.

755
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,520
Uh, I guess better in what sense?

756
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,680
Well, I know I don't want to see the syrup canisters.

757
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,320
That's kind of gross.

758
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,160
You know, that's how they make it, though.

759
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,120
So you just want to say that in mind.

760
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah, basically, because those are like

761
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,880
it's just like a big like those metal circular kind of things

762
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,080
that almost look like they're helium tanks and some certain kind of helium

763
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,840
tanks. Yeah, yeah.

764
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,720
I don't know. I think in the past, I had more of a shitty family

765
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,560
fun center vibes.

766
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,520
And this has more of like a brew pub.

767
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,760
Yeah, it's a brew pub with a lot of Yelp reviews of like

768
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,680
grown men hit by 10 year old son a number of times when you were a race.

769
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,200
I say good.

770
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,040
That's how you make them a man.

771
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,840
Yeah. Scott was talking about bringing his son.

772
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,160
I said that this is a this is a future in which my son is older,

773
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,600
more confident and doesn't whine at everything that suggested that he does.

774
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,440
So a lot has to happen between now and then.

775
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,880
But yes, I would.

776
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,280
I'll give it a shot when a lot changes.

777
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,120
So, yeah, we went in there and they give you the option.

778
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,840
They try to sell you the annual pass.

779
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,640
I don't know if you remember.

780
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,280
Did they try to do that to you? Probably.

781
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,480
Probably. Yeah.

782
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,640
And we said, no, we want one race, which is still kind of unclear.

783
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,920
Like how many laps are races?

784
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,320
I didn't know that going in.

785
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm sure if we asked, they would tell us.

786
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
And according to look and Scott and I have printouts of our race as well.

787
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Yeah, we got our graphs.

788
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
Oh, I've been wondering what this paper was.

789
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,280
I was like, yeah, I was there that I didn't grab.

790
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,760
Yeah, it is oddly.

791
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,800
Yeah, we're very analog in this.

792
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,160
They're going to hear a lot of paper rattling.

793
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,640
Yeah. So let's get the stats.

794
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,000
You got to print out. You got to print out of how you did.

795
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,680
It's a couple of stats about a lot of like diner place mats with advertisements.

796
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,880
Yeah. The advertisements are about the other counters,

797
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,760
the other options at K1 race.

798
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
Yeah, yeah, they're smart about it.

799
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,720
There's a coupon here and then there's what other else?

800
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,840
What other stuff you can get involved in like the K1 Teen Cup?

801
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,640
Everybody, you have to realize it's double sided.

802
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,720
So there's stuff on both sides of the sheet of paper.

803
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,480
And the smallest block is the block of their progress.

804
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,640
And then everything else is like pictures and advertisements

805
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
and other things about stuff about K1.

806
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,880
It's almost like a did you guys have Weekly Reader growing up?

807
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,240
Do you remember this?

808
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,040
There was a little like a thin kind of like magazine

809
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,120
they would pass out in the only Midwest.

810
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,480
Oh, for kids, like at elementary school.

811
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,080
Yeah, it's called Weekly Reader and it would be like on this thin paper.

812
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,040
Like the scholastic book like kind of.

813
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,120
Yeah, something like that.

814
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,280
Anyway, we'll do Weekly Reader would be a good episode for podcast The Ride.

815
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Really? I feel like I want to pitch that you would have been like, no way.

816
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,760
No, we clean out because we're doing a whole month about weekly readers.

817
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,080
So, yeah, we're just going to have to wait on that one.

818
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,800
But you know what?

819
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,240
So so my I will say this, looking at this,

820
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,400
I'm getting all over the place here, but to justify my worry about teens,

821
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,960
there is a K1 Teen Cup.

822
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,880
So they are encouraging teens to race and they're having them.

823
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,840
How dare they close this establishment?

824
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying.

825
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm just saying they can't even vote.

826
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,000
I was right. There's a K1 Junior League, a K1 Teen Cup.

827
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,000
So if the Teen Cup was there that day,

828
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,000
they might have thrown Scott and I on the track with them.

829
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,880
I mean, oh, and then they would have just outraged you.

830
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,640
Yeah, they would have destroyed us.

831
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,360
Like you guys are imagine walking into the movie The Warrior.

832
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,720
That's what I said earlier.

833
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah, exactly what Mike said. Yes.

834
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,920
It's almost like the thing Mike exactly said.

835
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,680
I said it. Yeah.

836
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,960
So so we go in there and they try to upsell us.

837
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,160
And it's still like because I just because of how we like annual passes

838
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,440
on the show, I was there was part of me, I was like, should we get an annual pass?

839
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,080
Probably not. But it's like it's not the worst.

840
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,640
It's like a good deal.

841
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,920
But I was like, realistically, am I going to be back here a lot?

842
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,360
And I don't think so. But we'll see.

843
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,320
Well, let me ask, did you guys like go karts growing up?

844
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,640
Because they really caught on at some point, seemingly in my memory.

845
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,120
Like family fun centers.

846
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,440
Ronnie Ronnie. Yeah.

847
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,560
I mean, I didn't ride that many.

848
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,760
But I do agree that there was a point when

849
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,240
and maybe that's just always the case.

850
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,520
Like once you become a certain age of the teenager

851
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,600
and you're able to sort of like do stuff, you're like,

852
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,240
yeah, these sort of fun park places, that's where we hang out now.

853
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,360
Yeah. Yeah.

854
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,640
And then that's when you go karts or whatever.

855
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,200
And so I I had a couple of those.

856
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,240
But I didn't I wasn't a frequenter of go karts stuff,

857
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,840
because I also am very.

858
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,280
I'm I'm pretty cautious.

859
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,440
So like a go karts are kind of to me, potentially there.

860
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,720
They seemed reckless. Like, oh, what are you?

861
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,400
I mean, then when you get in here, like, oh, yeah, this is kind of what it is.

862
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,640
But the idea of it felt so like so I would always be like,

863
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,160
no, you guys go do your ride. It's OK.

864
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,360
I'll be over here and I'll wait around or whatever.

865
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,800
And I never really got on as many as, you know, I probably could have. Sure.

866
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,480
Yeah, this is exactly me.

867
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,360
I think I here's here's my full scoop.

868
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,880
I had never done go karting until yesterday for this.

869
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,680
I've never once.

870
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,800
And I have the exact same situation you just described.

871
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,840
We're like, no, you guys guys just don't really.

872
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,520
Where I think I was assuming a degree of danger

873
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,040
that you realize is not there as soon as you do your first turn in the car.

874
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,720
I just like my whole life, I'm imagining something so much crazier than it is.

875
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,960
Yes. I will also say yesterday was my first time riding in a go kart.

876
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,800
And the reason I was not allowed to.

877
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,920
I was told another thing on the list.

878
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,040
I was told this Ronnie in on your childhood.

879
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,600
I was told this was too dangerous.

880
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,400
This was like a lot of things I was not allowed to do as a kid,

881
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,800
including not having posters above my bed because they would fall

882
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
and suffocate me during the night.

883
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,880
Interesting.

884
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,360
That's a new one.

885
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,520
I think I have said that on the show.

886
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,640
I don't remember that one.

887
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,360
Casey, you heard that?

888
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,240
I didn't remember that.

889
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,800
Now in California, you really aren't because of earthquakes.

890
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,360
You're not supposed to.

891
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,640
Well, I grew up in Illinois.

892
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,920
You grew up in Illinois, though, so I don't quite get that.

893
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,160
The poster could suffocate you.

894
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,400
I swear this is what she said.

895
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,640
And she claims to not remember this.

896
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Like a lot of things she claims to not remember.

897
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,320
Like a plastic bag.

898
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,720
It would have to get so precisely on your mouth.

899
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,280
Like you would, I guess, if it fell on you and then you you'd have to roll over

900
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,160
a couple of times, you'd have to end up being a real pig in a blanket with that.

901
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,640
It would have to be wrapped in it.

902
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
It would have to be like a Mr.

903
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Bean episode for me to suffocate with a poster.

904
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,960
Your childhood.

905
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,080
It's like the the video game Hitman, where it's like,

906
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,400
and there are so many ways you could kill somebody.

907
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,960
There's so many scenarios.

908
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,360
Well, you can use the wire.

909
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,840
The tacks on his poster so that when he goes to sleep at night,

910
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,800
they fall off the wall and suffocate him.

911
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,400
No gauze is in the house because it could be used to bludgeon you

912
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
or the shards could cut you.

913
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,400
Yes, that is. Yeah.

914
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,840
So stuff was it was hard to get to a water park.

915
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,000
I was not allowed to go to a water park with his friends.

916
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,600
I had to go with my mother until I was like 16 or seven.

917
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,160
Like it was like at 18, I went to Noah's Ark alone,

918
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,560
which is a water park up on Wisconsin Dulles.

919
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,440
So there were a lot of no-nos.

920
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,200
No, I cannot have a skateboard.

921
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
That was too dangerous.

922
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,200
So the one the listeners have heard this, but Ronnie, the one that I

923
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,600
I forgot is how you had to lie about you to lie

924
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,200
so that because you could not go to water park birthdays.

925
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,120
So you had to lie to my friends.

926
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah.

927
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,040
So like I would get invited to my friend's birthday every year,

928
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,600
which was at a water park for whatever, like teenage years.

929
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,440
And my mom would be like, well, tell them you're going to celebrate

930
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,680
your father and I's anniversary.

931
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,200
And I go, why would I be doing that?

932
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
Well, but that because it's it's not it's a white lie.

933
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,360
OK, yeah.

934
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,520
I go, I'd rather just say you won't let me go.

935
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,080
In this instance, I would rather just tell the truth.

936
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,680
Yeah, that seems more lame than me.

937
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,200
You argue with me about this, too.

938
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,640
You'd be like, no, no, no, it's more lame if you say that I won't let you go.

939
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,760
I go, no, it's not.

940
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,720
At least there's like an external force preventing me from doing it.

941
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,400
It's not that I'm just like a little wuss.

942
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,320
Look, son, you're already pretty lame.

943
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,720
So like, I don't want you to be more lame.

944
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,640
I'm hindering you a bunch in your childhood.

945
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,360
I agree. But at the same time, I don't want to make you even more of a lame

946
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,760
than you have to be at this point.

947
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,280
You're celebrating me and your father's anniversary.

948
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,080
Sorry, it's not lame in the least.

949
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,680
And it was always there.

950
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,280
I wrote you a little song, Mom and Dad.

951
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,240
I'm the kid you had and I'm wishing you an anniversary.

952
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,640
My sister and I are putting on our annual pageant to celebrate

953
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,320
Mother and Father's anniversary.

954
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,160
And of course, the rehearsals take two weeks.

955
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,000
So your birthday always falls in this two week gap.

956
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,600
So I'm so sorry, but I always do a little we always do little skits.

957
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,040
I'm going to be Austin Powers saying that your anniversary is groovy.

958
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,640
And my sister, she's going to be Dr.

959
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,720
Evil. This birthday will this anniversary will not stand.

960
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,400
We had to put on a performance every year.

961
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,520
I had to do something. I don't remember what happened.

962
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,560
I may have one year made her say it.

963
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,360
I don't like it. I don't even it's so cloudy.

964
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
What's the oldest you were that this happened?

965
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,840
That's a good question.

966
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,800
It probably 14.

967
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,880
I mean, 14, maybe 13 or 14.

968
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,120
Like it seemed to let high school.

969
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,280
I don't think he had this every year.

970
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,320
So probably like 13, 14 ish.

971
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,440
Maybe a little give or take a year.

972
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,400
So so do you think that that's an experience now that you have in your own child?

973
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,880
You're like, obviously, you're not like, I got to make sure my child takes risk.

974
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,160
But does it make you more aware of the idea of that you have to be

975
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,520
or that you probably will be a little bit more loose

976
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,960
with like what you let your child experience?

977
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,080
Yeah, it does. And it does.

978
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,880
And it's interesting because I think on some of the actual specific

979
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,600
point, like specific places and things I'm going to be looser on.

980
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,960
But the feeling of anxiety does remain and it comes out in different moments.

981
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Now, you're not on this free climbing right now, right?

982
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,000
She's free. Like Tom Cruise and the possible.

983
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,400
Yeah, she's training to do like the free solo climb.

984
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes.

985
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,640
So I think there'll be some stuff I'm looser on.

986
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,800
But the feeling of like,

987
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,000
oh, my God, anything can kill you is there.

988
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,440
And it'll pop up in weird ways for me.

989
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,320
So so so yes and no, I can manage.

990
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,920
I at least am aware of it, which I think is the good thing.

991
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,680
Right. And managing is the is the managing to make it OK.

992
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,840
I'm not going to worry about it.

993
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,720
I swear everything's going to be OK.

994
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,160
So going into yesterday, in the back of my mind,

995
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,000
there was a little bit of like, you're doing something dangerous.

996
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,400
But I had the only the reason I was a little mom over your shoulder.

997
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,360
The reason I was this day.

998
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,240
Yeah, yes. Well, yes.

999
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,960
Tell Scott and the podcast listeners that it's our anniversary.

1000
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,840
And you have to tell them it's your anniversary.

1001
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,280
You're celebrating me and your father's anniversary.

1002
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,400
Yeah. I, I.

1003
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,440
My mother is like, there's a little great kazoo on my shoulder.

1004
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:42,080
I might I might have some some ammunition for your mother,

1005
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,440
because my go kart memories are more of what she worried about.

1006
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,920
Hold on one second, because I just want to finish this thought

1007
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,080
and then we'll get to your traumatic stuff.

1008
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,960
We'll get to his ammunition for your mother.

1009
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,680
Ammunition. Yeah.

1010
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Settling.

1011
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,440
You will get to get to your pro mother.

1012
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1013
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,040
He's going to kill your mom for you.

1014
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,280
No, his mom's going to kill him.

1015
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,320
I also. You're giving her the ammunition.

1016
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,960
Like the plastic bags from the grocery store that you could suffocate.

1017
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,480
Oh, yeah. Be careful.

1018
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,800
Don't go to the grocery store by yourself.

1019
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,360
That's true.

1020
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,440
And certainly my mom hasn't brought up a bunch of things to worry about

1021
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,560
in regards in regards to the baby.

1022
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,240
That's not happened. Oh, OK.

1023
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,560
That's good to hear.

1024
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,480
That sounds genuine and that's good to hear.

1025
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,960
She lives closer to you now.

1026
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,080
So that's that helps.

1027
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,440
So so we went in there and I was also in my mind sometimes.

1028
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,040
I'm like I was thinking there would be like go cards like Mario Kart,

1029
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,800
like smaller carts, but that's not like Mario Kart, the original.

1030
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,840
But yeah, once I saw I was like, OK, those are bigger things.

1031
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,480
Now they have to fit a person.

1032
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,360
So, yes. Yes.

1033
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,200
As opposed to a little dinosaur.

1034
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,080
Well, Bowser crammed his way in there.

1035
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,240
So yeah, that's true.

1036
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,760
Maybe I was I also say I will say I had I was a little it was a little tight for me.

1037
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,160
I'm a tall guy.

1038
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,000
You're a tall guy. Yeah.

1039
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,520
So so we did this.

1040
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,240
Now, the only reason I wasn't super, super worried was because I have done

1041
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,000
a crazier version of this, which I've talked about on the show before,

1042
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,840
like an actual drive on the desert at a track where you get in a car.

1043
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,800
Oh, and there's a guy next to you to make sure you don't crash.

1044
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,560
Oh, just yelling stuff at you the whole time.

1045
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,800
And you go it was a bachelor party.

1046
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,320
You're going like 100 miles an hour and insane.

1047
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,920
Right. That sounds. Yeah, that sounds crazy.

1048
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,200
So so that's the only reason I wasn't a little bit more worried.

1049
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,240
But like a straightaway or no, like this, like a track,

1050
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,520
like kind of like turns and stuff, which is and and other people on the track.

1051
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,960
Oh, which is insane.

1052
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,440
Yeah. OK. And the cars are nice.

1053
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,480
And the cars are not mess these up.

1054
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,440
So we go in there.

1055
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,640
They give they get what do they call them?

1056
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,520
The things we got for free.

1057
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,080
Head socks, socks.

1058
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,560
You get a head sock for free.

1059
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,600
Jason, did Racers Edge give you a free head sock?

1060
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,120
You know, I had I don't remember head socks.

1061
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,640
I remember like, I don't.

1062
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,600
Would you call it a neck brace?

1063
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,920
Like the neck padding?

1064
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,680
I don't think you would call it like a neck.

1065
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,520
The the sort of padded thing.

1066
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,840
What the old lady version of Ernest wore.

1067
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,160
Are you talking about motorcycle helmet?

1068
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,920
Are you talking about after the race when they put you?

1069
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,000
No, no. It's under your helmet.

1070
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,920
It was like a neck guard. Really?

1071
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,480
That's weird. That's much worse.

1072
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,200
That's a lot worse on top and on top of a motorcycle helmet.

1073
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Oh, I guess they knew what their rides were.

1074
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,080
Racers Edge was like, this is a neck pain for sure.

1075
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,280
It's a preemptive neck brace.

1076
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,440
With some lawsuits.

1077
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,320
You're going to get whiplash.

1078
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,480
This is like to slightly decrease your whiplash.

1079
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,840
Yeah. So we put those on.

1080
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,520
And very quickly, I remembered I have mild claustrophobia

1081
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,760
when it comes to.

1082
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,200
Yes. No.

1083
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,440
We've talked about this before.

1084
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,400
I had to bow out of an escape room.

1085
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,920
A year and a half ago, because I was wearing a mask at that point

1086
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,120
and they put your big kind of restrictive outfit on you.

1087
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,160
And I had a mild panic panic attack.

1088
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,240
And I remembered I did a Funny or Die video with Jeremy Piven

1089
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,120
many years ago where I had to put on a racing helmet and I had a mild helmet.

1090
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,800
Yeah, I had a mild like, oh, I don't like this.

1091
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,440
So we go and I'm like, oh, shit.

1092
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,520
I wasn't even thinking about worrying about this.

1093
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,000
You didn't indicate this to me at all, probably because I couldn't see your face

1094
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,320
by the time that this was on.

1095
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,880
Well, at this point, I was just like,

1096
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,240
I tried to serve like I was just like, no, you're not freaking out here.

1097
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,120
So I put the thing on. I put the helmet on.

1098
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,080
I'm like, no, you're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine.

1099
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,840
I'm thinking this in my head yesterday.

1100
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,920
Everything is fine. I missed all of this.

1101
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
And then once they put me in the car, I forget it.

1102
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,360
But it's such a weird thing to have this like pop up once in a while

1103
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,320
because your brain knows it's stupid. Right.

1104
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
As soon as you're distracted, it's fine. Right.

1105
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,560
But there was a good like 30 seconds, not not.

1106
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,040
I didn't come anywhere close, like the Minotaur escape room

1107
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,640
to bowing out or anything, but it was still it happened.

1108
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,160
Ronnie, we'd love to have you on the show.

1109
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,680
Let's just do a couple rounds of picking a topic to make sure we get one

1110
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,680
where that causes me multiple levels of anxiety.

1111
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,400
So I guess anything with dark caves or any sort of like. Yeah.

1112
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,920
What about we never reviewed MRI machines?

1113
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,920
Have you ever been in an MRI?

1114
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,520
But they have to be themed MRI machines.

1115
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,280
If they have like a pattern. If they play music through it,

1116
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,560
then any of them can be. That's true. That's true.

1117
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,080
So so once I was seated in the in the car, that was fine.

1118
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,600
And then I was ready to race. I was ready to go.

1119
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,160
So anyway. Mm hmm.

1120
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,240
Overall, I'm back up to Ronnie's experience, which is wait,

1121
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,480
or did you you did it by yourself, but was there anyone else on the track?

1122
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,360
Oh, for sure. There's a lot of people like and there were

1123
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,600
because at first it was

1124
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,000
a group of teens.

1125
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,160
Oh, like so I think they were like a group.

1126
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,160
It was like, oh,

1127
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,800
maybe like a family and and other people.

1128
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,360
And so it was like a bunch of younger people that were just in that ride

1129
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,040
to sort of like knew each other.

1130
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,120
So like they were sort of like bumping each other a little bit or like

1131
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,080
or even when they came in, you know, like when you come back in

1132
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,520
to pull your car in, they're like kind of smashing it to you.

1133
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,440
They're like, oh, oh, and they're like laughing like, ha ha ha.

1134
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,720
Whatever that type of thing.

1135
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,040
But it's because they knew each other.

1136
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,840
So it was like, oh, we're just having fun with our buddies.

1137
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,040
And then they got out.

1138
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,200
And so I went in by myself.

1139
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,760
And it was like people who sort of knew each other.

1140
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,720
So it was like, I'm going to say a pack of women, but no, it's not as aggressive as

1141
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,040
is it sounds like a woman who knew each other.

1142
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,360
So they were like having fun and then some guys, whatever.

1143
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,120
And then there was one guy who is like.

1144
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,080
If you've ever seen any of the Fast and Furious movies, it's like one person

1145
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,920
who is like the that the racer who was like, oh, man, that's

1146
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,720
that's that's Tony so and so like he had that vibe.

1147
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,960
Right. Just just

1148
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,680
just he looked like

1149
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,600
he looked like one of the bad guys from any sort of Rambo movie,

1150
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,040
like just somebody, just somebody from somewhere else

1151
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,560
who's just whose job is to just kill Rambo.

1152
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,960
So that was that was the way he looked like.

1153
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,600
But apparently they had to have known this person because it's like, oh, hey,

1154
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,880
what's up, man? And he's like, yeah.

1155
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,160
So I'm thinking like maybe he like he's worked there or it's rather he he works

1156
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,960
there. So this is him.

1157
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,280
Or he races there so much that he's like a regular.

1158
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,040
So the guy knew him.

1159
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,560
And so I'm going to tell you my experience because this is how I knew.

1160
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,160
This is how I felt like I was being cheated.

1161
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,600
We start the race.

1162
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm I'm racing, OK, I'm like driving,

1163
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,400
shifting and doing all this stuff and not shifting, just breaking, breaking

1164
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,200
and gassing.

1165
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,280
There are no shifts in breaking and gassing.

1166
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,880
I was like, well, you got a different going nuts.

1167
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,320
I thought you got a different car than us.

1168
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,080
Yeah, I know. I think there might be different.

1169
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,120
There might be more complicated cars.

1170
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,880
I think there is something where you could drift or something.

1171
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,640
I think there's a drift night.

1172
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,560
Uh huh. Where they modify the cars and there's also a glow night.

1173
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,160
Well, yeah, we got to talk about that later.

1174
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,800
Well, so I'm so I start driving.

1175
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,640
So I'm I'm like the last car.

1176
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,640
Or maybe he's behind me, rather.

1177
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,040
He was in front of me or behind me.

1178
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,800
So, yeah, so I'm driving.

1179
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,560
The guy hasn't moved.

1180
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,400
And so it was finally like they've got far enough.

1181
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,120
And then you just see him sort of take off.

1182
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,680
But you're like, we're so far ahead.

1183
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,160
And seemingly I'm flooring it.

1184
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,920
Like, I feel like I'm pushing the gas through the floor.

1185
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,920
So I'm riding like if we're all going the same speed, there's no way.

1186
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,200
Yeah. And then he just sort of starts whipping through.

1187
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,840
Wow. To the point where that's when I realized I was like, I think he

1188
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,080
I think his thing is just faster than everybody else's,

1189
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,200
because there is no way that he's lapping us like that, because I was

1190
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,200
by no means playing it safe.

1191
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,960
I was

1192
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,800
can't break when I had to sort of get into a turn.

1193
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,760
But I was because I was literally trying to be like it was like a puzzle to me.

1194
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,160
I was like, I got to get this like if you were a test or something.

1195
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,640
I was like, I got to get through him.

1196
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,360
Got to get through this person.

1197
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,480
Oh, come on, get there around this person.

1198
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,040
All right, Greg, got around this person.

1199
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,040
Like so it literally was like, I'm going as fast as this thing can possibly go.

1200
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,560
But I think but at one point, and this is how I realized

1201
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:45,480
that how they control sort of the the the.

1202
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,560
Oh, they can turn they can do it like throttle.

1203
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,080
This is because somebody had sort of

1204
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,200
she turned T-bone turned or got turned sideways.

1205
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,000
So he had to sort of like stop it so they can manually stop it.

1206
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,080
So we couldn't drive our cars until they sort of got the car turned around.

1207
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,520
So that's when I was like, are they juicing his car up?

1208
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,240
Like, does he have if there's to speak in terms of there's like

1209
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,800
if there's like a 10 like a 10 speed level.

1210
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,880
And let's say they got all of our cars at like a five.

1211
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,360
Right. Do they have his at like an eight?

1212
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:23,920
You know, because he's like somebody who knows the track clearly.

1213
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,040
They're like, oh, yeah, you're going to you can do whatever the fuck you want.

1214
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,720
Like, we trust you not to wreck your car.

1215
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,120
And so he was able to sort of like I think he might have let me like twice.

1216
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,200
He was going so fast, going so much just so much faster than everybody else

1217
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,120
that he was able to catch up and sort of like that.

1218
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,720
That was his this deal.

1219
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,520
I want to make it a challenge for me.

1220
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,920
Sort of the sort of vibe.

1221
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,040
Let everybody lay back, let everybody else go.

1222
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,360
And then we're tempted at every turn to compare this to Mario Kart.

1223
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,280
But this is this is like he had a star. Right.

1224
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,080
He had the star.

1225
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,360
How he got it, I don't know if he like if that's a deal he makes with the place.

1226
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,840
Right. But that's that's it.

1227
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,760
But it definitely was like the experience of, oh,

1228
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,200
and there's a split second for you where you kind of go,

1229
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,480
do I want to kind of get into go kart racing?

1230
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,400
Like, do I want to come here enough to where they allow me to go faster than that?

1231
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,280
And then you're like, think about it.

1232
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,680
You like, of course, I don't know.

1233
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,840
No way do I want to devote my time, my free time to being the go kart guy.

1234
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,560
As soon as you do one thing in your regular life, it reminds you.

1235
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,600
Oh, right. Yes, I am not.

1236
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,720
I cannot drop everything and be Mr. Go Kart.

1237
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,040
Because I felt similar.

1238
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,640
I don't think I went for it as hard as you did.

1239
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,680
But I'm looking at stats and I'm like, I think I could increase these stats.

1240
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,400
I think I know what I could do different now.

1241
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,240
Maybe I got to start.

1242
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,400
And then like I then I see my son again and like,

1243
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,400
wait, this is what I have to be doing.

1244
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,480
Not to not have responsibilities.

1245
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,600
Now, go kart stats.

1246
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,760
It seems like it reminds me of like the indoor skydiving at City Walk,

1247
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,640
where like we did it once and we're like, you know, just trying to keep it together.

1248
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,160
And then sometimes you walk by and there's clearly regulars.

1249
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,280
Like there was like a 12 year old kid there once,

1250
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,760
and he's just like flipping around and bouncing.

1251
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,680
And they turn the air up for him.

1252
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,880
They turn it up so he can go high.

1253
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,920
It's funny that you mentioned that, because within the time frame

1254
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,800
of when Mike first asked me to do this and till now,

1255
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,360
I've done so many stuff in between that window.

1256
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,840
And I fly was one of the things that I really did.

1257
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,080
Oh, you do that?

1258
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,600
I did it with my like for my girlfriend's birthday.

1259
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,280
She had like a bunch.

1260
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,480
She doesn't use gift cards.

1261
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,960
Like she forgets that she has them. Sure. So.

1262
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,280
We basically I basically divvied up all the gift cards

1263
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,080
of hers that I could find.

1264
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,720
And then we just started going around places to wear the gift card.

1265
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,760
Some of these were so old that people had to sort of like go to a different system.

1266
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,400
Like I fly was one of them where they were like, we have to sort of we got a new system.

1267
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,560
So we have to go dig it to our sort of analog manual system

1268
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,280
to sort of like find this gift card thing.

1269
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,080
So it was situations like that.

1270
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,080
And so we went and I was not going to do it.

1271
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,960
But I but I said, if I get this for her

1272
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,320
and I don't do it, she's not going to enjoy it as much.

1273
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,880
So I had to do it.

1274
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,120
And so I did it as well.

1275
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,520
And it's like, yeah, that's like there's people in there that is like, oh, yeah.

1276
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,280
In my it was just the instructor who was like, all right,

1277
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,000
trying to show you all how to do it.

1278
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,560
And when they're doing it, you're like, yeah, maybe I do want to kind of

1279
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,600
because they only like letting you do like tandem sort of was like,

1280
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,640
keep it straight, go up and down.

1281
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,160
Yeah. And then it's like, all right.

1282
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,800
Now, after the fact, that's how they get you,

1283
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,600
because it's like, all right, well, you've got you.

1284
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,680
It's perfectly.

1285
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,000
Totally. They're like, all right.

1286
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,680
And now you got the ride or now you've done it before.

1287
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,560
So now do you want to, you know, maybe invest in this a little bit more right now

1288
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,680
was the only time you can get a 10 pack.

1289
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,040
And for this price now, because you did the ride.

1290
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,920
But if you leave here, then it's regular price again to get the

1291
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
10 tri ride or whatever. Right.

1292
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,040
And I was seriously thinking like, that's kind of a good deal.

1293
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,640
Do I want to end the new the same thing being like, I'm not the I fly guy.

1294
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,760
I'm not going to be here once a week, spending my time trying to, you know,

1295
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,480
try to get better.

1296
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,680
Now I get to turn around one time or whatever.

1297
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,880
Like it was like, I don't I'm not going to do this.

1298
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,360
It's interesting. But I don't have the time. Yeah. Yeah.

1299
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,160
But it's so it's a perfect team thing because you do have the time.

1300
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,000
If you have the time.

1301
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,120
These are great team places because you can be like the coolest team

1302
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,880
with a very specific skill, like that your friends probably do not have.

1303
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,480
Yeah. And then you compete with other teens in the teen cup. Right.

1304
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,840
So now with this context, Mike, do you see why the teen cup

1305
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,640
is not necessarily an evil?

1306
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,480
No, I understand.

1307
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,640
There's probably good teens that compete in the teen cup,

1308
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,400
and they just like the spirit of competition.

1309
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,920
And yeah, maybe it gives them some sort of pride in something

1310
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,040
that they've learned how to do.

1311
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,040
I get that they're not all bad teens.

1312
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,360
I don't want to paint the broad brush

1313
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,640
that all teens are going to hassle an older man.

1314
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,560
That's not true. I know.

1315
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,760
I know that. But this is just a logical mind of mine.

1316
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,360
That was brave of you to say.

1317
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,840
I mean, you feel free to qualify and say an older man

1318
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,040
who is totally down with teens and knows what.

1319
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,400
Well, yeah, older man who is sort of in tune with the young generation

1320
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,600
or a lot of ways.

1321
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,760
Because you go to Hot Topic once every nine months and you see items on the shelf.

1322
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,120
So, you know what teens like.

1323
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,680
I'm drinking liquid death water.

1324
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,520
I was just telling everybody before the record now, that's like a younger,

1325
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
hipper thing to do.

1326
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,560
Does the audience know this, that Mike's drinking liquid death now?

1327
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,480
You guys should probably be listeners.

1328
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,960
You should be aware Mike has made a choice in his life.

1329
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,960
You have stylish camo pants on.

1330
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,520
I went to camo joggers a few years ago, almost exclusively.

1331
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,280
Thank you for noticing.

1332
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,560
Obviously.

1333
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,840
That's a good way to hide if a bunch of if you're in the jungle

1334
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,240
and there's a bunch of teens running loose in there.

1335
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:04,840
That's right.

1336
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,840
You know, if you're if you're on a hike and you don't realize

1337
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,840
that you like crossed a border into a paintball zone.

1338
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,400
Yeah.

1339
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,960
Now you're on the run like, oh, I'm going to get hit.

1340
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,600
But maybe you won't because you got the camera.

1341
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,160
I was not allowed to do paintball either because it was dangerous.

1342
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,040
Well, that is a weapon.

1343
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,840
It does. I am scared. I've never done it.

1344
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,840
That feels I'm a little scared to do it because I was hurt.

1345
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,560
So never done. Yeah.

1346
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,800
But we should probably do it and just hurt each other.

1347
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,480
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you wear your camo pants.

1348
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,240
Yeah, you can hide.

1349
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,280
You can also hide against the fake plant Instagram walls.

1350
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,560
You can disappear into them.

1351
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,280
Is there like a gastropub style paintball place that we could go

1352
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,400
that has some sort of a lounge that a cancer of publics

1353
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,040
with the worst food you've probably ever eaten.

1354
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,040
Fair enough. Yeah.

1355
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,080
And if you're going to be worried about anybody, I would say

1356
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,280
I worry about any of the patrons at the paintball place.

1357
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,600
They're probably people who I own real guns.

1358
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,520
And this is the only way I get to get my my gun shooting out.

1359
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,920
It's the only way I can shoot real aggro people that are like,

1360
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,760
you can go with your friends and it's different.

1361
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,240
But if you're like, all right, we're going to go and sort of be amongst

1362
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,960
amongst the regular patrons of somewhere like this,

1363
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,840
that's probably going to meet a lot of more aggro people.

1364
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,320
Yeah. And not the teens are not the people I'm worried about.

1365
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,880
Right. No, it's the guy like putting his paintball gear, aren't going like

1366
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,600
this, just like being back in NOM and you're like, oh, no.

1367
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,520
You want to be back. Full metal jacket.

1368
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,040
Multiple different style of paintball weapons.

1369
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,840
You got a handheld paintball gun. He's whipping that to his pants.

1370
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,360
The guy got like a AK 47 paintball.

1371
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,480
He shoots himself in the head with his own paintball gun.

1372
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,760
No, no.

1373
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,080
You're back me to a corner. I got to take myself out.

1374
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,800
It's like, what are you talking about?

1375
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,080
I haven't talked to you.

1376
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,280
I'd rather do it. No, right now, I'd rather you do it than I.

1377
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,400
Rather, I do it than you do it.

1378
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
So how that is the city.

1379
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,480
Yeah. The cool guy doesn't.

1380
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,320
The cool evil guy doesn't surprise me there because there's so much going on.

1381
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,480
YouTube, you look at the YouTube at all for K1 speed.

1382
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,760
A little bit. Yeah.

1383
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,440
It's like there's they got a lot.

1384
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,240
There's a whole thing.

1385
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,600
And like as they show you on these these printouts, they have weekly

1386
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,600
like the National Leaderboard and the Burbank Burbank Adult's Best of the Week.

1387
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,320
So they keep track of all these numbers.

1388
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,480
Yeah. You know, like you can look at this right now and see number one, Scott Gardner.

1389
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,120
Number number on the national

1390
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,040
leaderboard. Yeah, no, that'd be that'd be national.

1391
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,360
Number two, it just says the ace.

1392
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,720
No, I don't know about the ace.

1393
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,400
The ace. Was that oh, that's when I used a different name.

1394
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,440
OK, OK. Yeah.

1395
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,040
Oh, that's right. I am the ace, too.

1396
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,080
Oh, and then there is also two interesting best stroller also.

1397
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,640
Best adult stroller.

1398
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Oh, yeah. Right.

1399
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,880
Jason Sheridan to see if there was a number one machine there.

1400
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,240
But I'm sure that's the adult stroller.

1401
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,120
I like how they break it down into rather child or adult or child.

1402
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,040
Yes. Yeah.

1403
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,600
Yeah. Burbank Adult, best of the week.

1404
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,800
And that's I'm confused by some of the scoring.

1405
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:12,400
All I know is that like, OK, let's just like the ranks is the rank out of

1406
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,440
how many people have ever done it, because the rank is out of 12 million.

1407
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,000
The rank is out of almost 13 million.

1408
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,600
And I'm happy to say I don't remember what yours is.

1409
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,360
Mine's like seven hundred and forty seven thousands something.

1410
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,440
Where are you? Nine hundred and seventy two thousand.

1411
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,600
OK, so we're in that we are in the top million.

1412
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,080
I was I was definitely a true that we might be so in the bottom or even.

1413
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:45,640
I mean, the worst would be to be in the bottom 10 of 13 million.

1414
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,040
But I think we're keeping pace with the top 15 percent, I think.

1415
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,920
Yeah. Or something.

1416
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,760
Pretty good. OK.

1417
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,960
Could you find you have an email because you had to sign a waiver before you start.

1418
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,640
Do you think you could like you search K-1 in your email?

1419
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,280
Do you think you might have because I found my results also in my email

1420
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,120
from the waiver as well.

1421
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,120
So maybe your results are somewhere on your email.

1422
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,920
Oh, I would have to look.

1423
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,560
I do remember I don't remember where I was in that.

1424
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,920
I do remember that.

1425
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,600
Oh, and I was rather like out of maybe like eight or nine racers.

1426
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,840
I was like fourth or fifth.

1427
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,960
But I only remember this because I remember kind of OK.

1428
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:34,960
And this is the most I remember it because I was like, oh, I was the worst man

1429
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,000
because everybody who was before me were all men

1430
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,600
and everybody I had beat were all the women.

1431
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,120
And I was like, interesting.

1432
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,280
OK, I'm the worst man.

1433
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,080
Yeah, I'm the worst man here, but I'm faster than all the women, which is like

1434
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,440
I just remember it was such a misogynistic thought to be like, huh, interesting.

1435
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,400
Like it's like, you all did this.

1436
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,520
That's strange. It broke down that way. That's interesting.

1437
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,160
I wish that we had broader stats.

1438
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,280
Now I sort of wish that we had I felt the same.

1439
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,400
I think we felt the same way going in where we were like,

1440
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,520
so you want to get there at opening.

1441
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,200
And then once we're in there,

1442
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,720
do you want to make sure that we sign up and pay as quickly as possible?

1443
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,160
And as soon as any other customers come in,

1444
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,640
people who maybe were older than us, let's make sure we let's get on the

1445
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,680
track, run us through the safety instructions really fast.

1446
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,800
I was I wanted to get out there so quickly on the track

1447
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,720
so that it was just the two of us.

1448
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,840
Yeah. But now that I've done it and I realize that it's not scary at all.

1449
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,160
Now I kind of wish that we had a bunch of teen stats to go up against.

1450
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,240
But unfortunately, that was a race of two people.

1451
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,440
It was a race of two people. Yeah.

1452
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,920
I will. I for the for the show.

1453
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah, it would be better if it was Scott and I versus six 13 year olds.

1454
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,760
Or like we like we got entered into the team cup that day.

1455
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,280
They're like, well, you can race today, but you're going to be part of the team cup.

1456
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,280
I'm like, OK, well.

1457
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,400
But I might have been like out. I'm out. I'm out.

1458
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,440
I don't care. I'm out of the show. I'm quitting the show.

1459
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,360
But there was a race going on, which was the race to get out there

1460
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,480
as quickly as possible to arrive.

1461
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,880
Maybe like not even a little late to like, let's make sure I'm parking at 1150.

1462
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,920
Because I do not want anyone else on that track.

1463
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,800
Let's put these face socks on as quickly as possible.

1464
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,480
Oh, Mike's having a panic attack.

1465
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,240
Let's look, let's muscle through that.

1466
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,040
Let's get through that as quickly as we can.

1467
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,520
And so the people come in after you like were

1468
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,800
people coming in

1469
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,720
regressive around the opening time or were you like, oh, it's us.

1470
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,560
And then it wasn't anybody else for like maybe minutes or so.

1471
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,720
There were in minutes later.

1472
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,080
We were right on our tail.

1473
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
But we got out of there.

1474
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,120
We did our race, just us and then got to watch their race

1475
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,240
and see that they were going, I would say, an average of 10 seconds faster per lap

1476
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,880
than we were.

1477
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,280
The our average laps are in the like

1478
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,920
35, 37 zone.

1479
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,360
And they were. What does that mean?

1480
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,960
That's seconds. Yeah, that's how long it's 12 laps.

1481
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,560
That's like that's how long one takes.

1482
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,960
So I'm averaging 35.

1483
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,760
And the people right after us, one of them was very young.

1484
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,560
We're we're at least 10 seconds faster.

1485
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,080
Yeah, that's that's where we.

1486
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,760
Yeah. OK.

1487
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,880
So we were I was because I did the car that car thing

1488
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,960
many years ago at this point.

1489
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,360
I was like, you know what? I know how to do this.

1490
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,160
What you do is you accelerate when there's like kind of a straightaway

1491
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,880
and then you hit the brake and do the turns, because that's what

1492
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,400
the man yells at you who's sitting next to you in this car thing to do.

1493
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,080
He goes, God, God, what floor like put the pedal to the floor.

1494
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,480
And you're like, that feels wrong.

1495
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,200
Like so you're like, I'm already going pretty fast.

1496
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,400
But that's like sort of how you're supposed to do it,

1497
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,280
because they have, you know, when you get to those turns,

1498
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,680
it already says slow down and stuff. So or break, maybe I forget.

1499
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,160
There's some warning on the when you're going around the turn.

1500
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,360
It says slow down or break.

1501
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,960
You mean on the track on the track itself?

1502
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,720
Yeah, that threw me for a while.

1503
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:01,160
I'm like, I guess so I have to slow down every single time I see the word slow down.

1504
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,040
Yeah. So so I think what you're really supposed to do is gun it

1505
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,160
on a straightaway and then just break as hard as you can and turn

1506
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,720
and then gun it again.

1507
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,880
And that's the way to get the fastest speed.

1508
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,440
Now, I realize after I've done this, there's no way I was going top speed

1509
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,000
on any of the straightaways because I was trying to do this in my mind.

1510
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,520
Scott was almost Scott almost left me.

1511
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,160
I was really trying towards the end.

1512
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,360
I thought you might have not. This is a question I had.

1513
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,560
I thought you might have been going easy on me because I go, Scott's going to lap me.

1514
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,160
I don't want him to lap me.

1515
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,280
And I started getting really stressed out about it.

1516
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,120
I knew this was happening.

1517
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,480
We didn't talk about it. We didn't talk about it.

1518
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,480
But when I started to realize it was a possibility like, oh, shit, can I?

1519
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,960
So I had some real motivation.

1520
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,720
My best lap was 11 out of 12.

1521
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,840
So you could tell that by the end, I'm thinking, can I do this?

1522
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,440
Can I do this? Maybe I can do this.

1523
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,240
And I didn't quite get there.

1524
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,000
Ultimately, I was still like kind of like,

1525
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,040
you know, like nervous enough to not fully.

1526
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,800
But I was getting more ambitious.

1527
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,440
I really liked that lap.

1528
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,200
To be completely fair to you, I did start first.

1529
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,240
It was a slow beginning.

1530
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,040
So I don't think all of that lapping would have been purely because I'm a speed demon.

1531
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,480
Well, I think what happened was you were just maintaining a normal

1532
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,640
amount of speed the whole time because you said you never broke.

1533
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,440
I never hit the brake one time.

1534
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,960
All I would do, I would ease off on the gas, but I did not ever brake.

1535
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,160
So I think this notion.

1536
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,400
Yeah, I think you were applying this real this crazy fast car logic.

1537
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,080
Right. But not doing it right.

1538
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,040
Yeah, not going fast enough for that.

1539
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
I never break is what is my but I did.

1540
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,240
This was accidental.

1541
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,200
Because I did.

1542
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,440
One of the times I went the fastest, I broke and I almost I did

1543
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,480
kind of almost hit the wall a little bit.

1544
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,760
So I was like, well, that's a little too fast, I think.

1545
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,520
Like, so I did it.

1546
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,840
I definitely was not going as fast as possible.

1547
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,640
But I think you've proven the tortoise and the hare almost in a way.

1548
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,000
Not that we were going slow and steady, but consistent speed

1549
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,800
is better unless you're very good at doing.

1550
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,240
I just don't think you want to break entirely.

1551
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:09,080
Because then you have to gear up this to go back to Mario Kart.

1552
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:13,240
This is if you get hit with a shell or spin around and lose your five coins.

1553
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,920
I'm talking about the very first Mario Kart.

1554
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,240
Of course, yes.

1555
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,680
Or you have to be lifted by the little guy with the fishing pole

1556
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,480
to the gear up again.

1557
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,440
Takes so long.

1558
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,520
Well, but I think what it would be is the drift type thing

1559
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,200
is that you're going so fast that break, you're skinning into position.

1560
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,720
And then you go right.

1561
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,080
Like, if you're doing it correctly, I don't think you're actually losing

1562
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,880
as much speed as you think you are.

1563
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,320
Oh, maybe. I think.

1564
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:43,000
But this is this is something you have to become, as we've said, a go kart guy.

1565
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,880
Yeah. To be able to master this.

1566
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,200
So I think for a first time.

1567
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,320
Mastering the art of how much brake, how much gas.

1568
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,160
I mean, full gas, but how much little brake to full gas.

1569
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:58,480
Yeah. Now, there are K one on one race classes

1570
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,680
where you can book a one on one racing lesson with an expert.

1571
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,520
You booked them for all of us.

1572
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:08,760
Yeah. Mike, she had 9999 for a lesson.

1573
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,920
Oh, my God.

1574
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,040
Is so it's possible.

1575
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,800
I'm look, I don't think I'm going to be a race guy, but I did leave there going,

1576
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,560
I could I should have done a little better.

1577
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,920
And it's not just because I lost the sky.

1578
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,960
It was just like I was like, I mean, give me one more.

1579
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,280
That's how that's how they do you.

1580
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,560
Because once you realize that it's like, oh, it's not as crazy as I thought

1581
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,840
it was going to be.

1582
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,240
Then you're like, all right, now that that part is over, I feel like

1583
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,000
I know how to approach this in a way that's that I can do better.

1584
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,680
Yes. Like if you would have had if let's say like if you would have bought two rides,

1585
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,120
because I think like the deals get better, the more rides you buy.

1586
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:45,600
Yeah, for sure.

1587
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,840
So it's like, oh, I would have paid for the two rides.

1588
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,080
And then the second ride, you would probably would have

1589
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,680
did much better than your first ride.

1590
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,360
That's right. But you're not going to pay for one ride and then go like,

1591
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,200
I think I got another one and then pay for another full one ride.

1592
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,720
It's like, oh, yeah, I'll just

1593
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,360
I'll just eat this will just burn me for the rest of my life.

1594
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,960
Yeah, yeah. Yes, I will never fix this.

1595
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,320
That's what that's what I left when I did that car thing.

1596
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,040
The car thing is I've said this, I'm repeating myself,

1597
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,560
but I guess I haven't said it in a little bit.

1598
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,440
What they do with when you're actually racing in a car is they take you

1599
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,720
on the track in a littler car with somebody else driving to familiarize

1600
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,000
your brain with the layout of the track.

1601
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,400
So it's in almost it's not like it's just like a little bit bigger

1602
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,280
than a sedan or something, but you're packed in there

1603
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,880
with the other people that are going to race.

1604
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,840
And a person is driving the car and you get on the track

1605
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,000
with a bunch of other cars and you race.

1606
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,040
She drives around the track and she's just like, so what are you going to do?

1607
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,480
You're going to be taking a left here and then you break here, accelerate here.

1608
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,280
And you're going and you're like in the backseat.

1609
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,880
I'm just like, this is the fastest I've ever been in a car ever.

1610
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,560
And she's driving, she's driving fast and explaining everything.

1611
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,600
She's like, it's amazing what she's doing.

1612
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,680
She's repeating the speech.

1613
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,760
She's memorized that she's

1614
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,680
breaking, going crazy or whatever.

1615
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,160
And then she goes, and now I'm going to go around again

1616
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,880
and really open it up.

1617
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,640
So she so you're already in the backseat of like this is a runaway car.

1618
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,440
I've never been in that. We're going to crash.

1619
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,920
Then the second lap, she goes as fast like what feels like twice as fast.

1620
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,560
And I remember just going, I am terrified.

1621
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,160
I've never been this scared in my life.

1622
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,600
I've never been in like a vehicle going this fast.

1623
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,160
And you get out and you're shaken.

1624
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,760
Everyone in the car with us was just like rubbing their head.

1625
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,240
Like, what are we going to be? What are we doing?

1626
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,840
This is like you feel like ten posters fell on you in the middle of the night.

1627
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:37,040
Yes. So everyone's like, everyone who's never done this before is commiserating.

1628
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,320
Like, oh, my God, what are we doing?

1629
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,280
And then you do get in the car and once you kind of get the hang of it,

1630
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,080
you've never felt adrenaline like this.

1631
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,200
And it's the same kind of thing where afterward I was like,

1632
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,520
I got to race a car again.

1633
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,720
Like your adrenaline is so high.

1634
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,920
You start having the thoughts of like, maybe I drive out into the 90 minutes

1635
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,040
into the desert every weekend.

1636
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:05,080
I wonder if I would feel like that if I did in a controlled environment like that.

1637
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,600
Yeah. Like I one time when I was back home, I'm from South Carolina.

1638
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,600
So I was driving.

1639
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,640
I flew into Atlanta to drive to South Carolina.

1640
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,960
And the car they gave me was this orange Challenger.

1641
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,760
Oh, I never been in a job.

1642
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:21,120
But they gave me I was like, OK.

1643
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,280
And I remember it was when I was driving back to Atlanta

1644
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,680
to return the car and fly home.

1645
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,680
It was late at night, like really late, like one, two a.m., that type of late.

1646
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,480
Right. And it was like just one of those kind of roads that's just like

1647
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,000
nothing's happening either way.

1648
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,480
It's just one of those straightaways.

1649
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,600
That's just it's the country.

1650
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,600
It's just a straightaway, nothing but trees and stuff like.

1651
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,200
And I'm in this Challenger.

1652
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,360
And there's no cars behind me.

1653
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,080
And there's like no cars in front of me.

1654
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:55,680
Like I'm sort of like in this unspoken like race

1655
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,680
with another car at some point.

1656
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,440
But I had dusted them.

1657
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,200
Yeah. And when I say dusted them, I just meant like, you know,

1658
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,360
I don't I didn't see him.

1659
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,600
And I was like, I think I'm going to open it up.

1660
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,600
And I just remember hitting the gas and being like, OK.

1661
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,840
And like when it got around 80, I got so scared.

1662
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,000
I was like, yeah, no, this is for me.

1663
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You know, and I and so the whole time I spent just like the wrestle of

1664
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,840
I'm going to I'm going to punch it a little bit.

1665
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,040
There's nobody that there's nobody going.

1666
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,200
There's nothing. This is a straightaway.

1667
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,080
Like nothing can happen.

1668
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,880
I was just going to press the gas and it got to a certain speed.

1669
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,360
And every time it got to a certain speed, I got too scared.

1670
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,440
And then let off the gas.

1671
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,320
So I wonder in the environment where it's like, this is it.

1672
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,320
Would I feel more comfortable?

1673
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,400
But I could not do it.

1674
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,560
Well, there's a guy yelling it again, the way they do it with the car racing

1675
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,680
is there's a person sitting next to you going faster yelling.

1676
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,200
There's a man screaming at you to do something.

1677
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,040
So like you will go a little faster than you are comfortable with.

1678
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,200
But it is such a thing like with driving a car,

1679
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,600
because you've driven a car for so many years that like just there's a comfortable

1680
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,440
speed, which like once you go past it, it feels like you're breaking

1681
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,640
the rules of space and time and like your brain all of a sudden just is like,

1682
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,480
we're out of control. I can't.

1683
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,320
A hundred is too much.

1684
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,640
And I think maybe I got to like 90 something,

1685
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,760
but he was still upset with the lack of speed.

1686
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,000
The guy next to me, because he was like, I'm driving with this

1687
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,600
fucking grandma over here.

1688
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm driving Miss Daisy.

1689
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,880
You hit like you hit like 99 per hour.

1690
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,120
And he's like, he's doing the pace car experience.

1691
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,440
Like the monitor car.

1692
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,800
I can't see anymore. Do you understand?

1693
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,200
You call me a grandma.

1694
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,400
I do think we should all do it.

1695
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,320
I think we should go race cars.

1696
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,120
Maybe you all should go race cars.

1697
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,000
For sure.

1698
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,920
No, it sounds awful.

1699
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,880
All right. Well, you two should race the cars and just stroll around.

1700
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:52,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1701
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,080
Just roll it around.

1702
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,920
See what drinks they got in the lobby of the car racing place.

1703
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,680
Yeah, no, it's it was scary.

1704
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,160
But by the end of it, I was like, that's the craziest adrenaline

1705
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,200
surge of my life. Yeah.

1706
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,000
So that it's worth it for that.

1707
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,480
And I'm sorry, more than finally getting the four dollars off at CVS.

1708
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,800
Well, that was a pretty big adrenaline surge.

1709
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,280
Ronnie, we have Jason brought to my attention.

1710
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:20,000
And if you go on CVS, sometimes in your email, they will give you a four dollar

1711
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,400
off coupon. And my coupon was only for two dollars.

1712
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,240
And Jason was getting a weekly four dollar coupon.

1713
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,800
I haven't gotten them in weeks.

1714
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,120
I keep getting the four dollar coupon now.

1715
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,800
So Jason is not getting it.

1716
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,240
And I've used it in the last two or three weeks.

1717
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,560
Anything you want.

1718
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,040
Look who's lapping who?

1719
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,040
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1720
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,960
I didn't think he was going to do that.

1721
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,080
I missed her checking.

1722
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,360
This is just happening.

1723
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,640
I wonder if it's just aminstance.

1724
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,840
I wonder if we have a listener at CVS corporate or something or CVS marketing.

1725
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,000
And they're like, this little asshole keeps spending four dollars on candy

1726
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,120
and nothing else.

1727
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,440
Well, Jason found the perfect hack.

1728
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,800
If they have like a two for three movie theater box candy,

1729
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,720
that's getting you under four dollars.

1730
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,920
You roll in there, get three boxes free,

1731
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,600
walk out with three boxes of movie theater candy.

1732
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,240
Yeah. And that's his that's his hack.

1733
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,240
I've done it once.

1734
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,600
Sure. Works. Yeah.

1735
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,000
Ronnie, you didn't know the kind of thrill junkies you were dealing with.

1736
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,440
We stepped on this podcast.

1737
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,520
Honestly, I thought I was coming in for a nice chill conversation.

1738
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,520
I didn't know I was going to be in here with just a bunch of adrenaline.

1739
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,560
A bunch of neurotic weirdo guys.

1740
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,720
What's the best deal you've ever gotten?

1741
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,040
Yeah. Like, get off my neck.

1742
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,160
Name a good deal you've had or you're out.

1743
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,000
Jesus. If you had said I want to talk about CVS, we would have said yes.

1744
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,520
CVS counts.

1745
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,200
Well, I did. I thought there's no way that these guys would talk about CVS.

1746
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,560
It's just too it's just too action packed. Yeah.

1747
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,480
Are they ready for it?

1748
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,880
Speaking of neuroses.

1749
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:56,400
So my go karting experience, I need to go go karts as kids.

1750
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,520
My my first memory was that

1751
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:07,320
my family had gotten like free tickets for like the go karts run by like

1752
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,800
Playland, the amusement park at the boardwalk in Ocean City.

1753
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,680
And these are the go karts.

1754
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,880
They're kind of like behind the boardwalk.

1755
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,960
And I think it was a lot of two seater go karts.

1756
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,040
And I think I was either too short or right on the line to drive it.

1757
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,720
But because it was two seater, I could ride in the passenger seat

1758
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,560
with my dad driving. Wow.

1759
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,320
And these are like the teen made ones because it's like seven dollars a race.

1760
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,320
It's not like thirty dollars.

1761
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,200
But I thought like, oh, this is good. I want to try this anyway.

1762
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,400
These things must go like 50 miles an hour.

1763
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,920
I'm sure they went 15 or 20 miles an hour.

1764
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,440
How old are you?

1765
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,280
Excuse me. How old were you?

1766
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,240
This is probably like 10.

1767
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,440
So then a few years later, it was like a group from the neighborhood

1768
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:58,640
like went to a shitty family fund center, like a junkie second rate,

1769
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,960
like Chuck E.

1770
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,280
Cheese, Dave and Busters.

1771
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,720
And that had a go kart track and whatever group we had gotten,

1772
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,640
we had like unlimited races from it.

1773
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,960
And so me and my brother did it like once or twice.

1774
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,040
And the like second time we did it, you know, we're pulling in the races ending.

1775
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,440
And like you said, like you're getting a little jostled

1776
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,080
as everyone's breaking and coming into a line and stuff.

1777
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,720
Whoever the young teen was

1778
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,400
did not signal to one of the cars like stop, slow down.

1779
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:39,400
And so they hit my brother's go kart at like whatever full speed was.

1780
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,520
And he got his shit rocked.

1781
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,920
Oh, like he was fine.

1782
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,680
It was just very shaken up.

1783
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,800
My mom was like screaming at the teens like, what the hell are you doing?

1784
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,880
What is it? Who's watching that? Who's in charge here?

1785
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,520
And probably making a bigger scene than he was upset about.

1786
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,560
So that shook me.

1787
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,120
Just witnessing all that shook me so much.

1788
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:07,800
I then did not do go karts for like 20 years until

1789
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,560
the former racers edge here in Burbank.

1790
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:19,000
So I did it a little bit as a kid and then not again until I was like 30.

1791
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,400
Because you don't want to be hit from behind.

1792
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,120
I didn't want to get nailed from behind,

1793
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:27,120
which seems to be a real possibility at this place

1794
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,360
as they give you a full motorcycle helmet.

1795
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,360
And there's a lot of reviews online of like I kept getting hit.

1796
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,160
There's no way people aren't getting hit daily.

1797
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,840
Right. There's just no way like I'm not saying it's maybe major stuff,

1798
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,240
but there's just no way when there's a track full of people and kids.

1799
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:52,120
Right. I think if it's like adults trying to really win or kids just being kids.

1800
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,920
I think I was lucky that people were trying to figure out what was going on.

1801
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,240
And I was just I was I was doing that thing where I was like, the goal is

1802
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,960
I want to try to pass many people as I can and then also do it in a way where

1803
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,920
it's like I'm crossing you, but I'm not hitting.

1804
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,160
I didn't tell you, you know, whatever it is for like puzzle piece or the situation.

1805
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,000
But I'm sure like when it's like, no, I'm trying to win.

1806
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,840
I'm sure it's a lot of bump Fast and Furious style bumping and

1807
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:23,680
and Nas hitting and oil slick oil slick drop off tricks and stuff.

1808
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:29,080
When I went like and when I had been there before, I noticed this too.

1809
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:33,640
There were like some very nice cars in the parking, like some Teslas,

1810
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,960
some Dodge Chargers.

1811
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,280
And I'm like, you've driven your nice car to this place to drive a worse car.

1812
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,440
You know, that's every I'd everyone's car is worse than a go cart.

1813
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,720
Yeah. I mean, honestly, it's not a situation if the go cart is better than your car.

1814
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,640
Yeah. I mean, in some cases, I've got worse cars than the go.

1815
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,920
You think you've got a worse car than a go cart?

1816
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,840
I mean, I've just had older cars or like borrowed friends in college, like old

1817
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,240
80s Volkswagen or whatever.

1818
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,160
That was like a tank.

1819
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,640
But let me ask you this. Did it have a roof?

1820
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,920
Yeah, it did have a roof.

1821
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,720
I think we're talking better than a go cart.

1822
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,080
Listen, I don't want to.

1823
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,320
I'm sure Scott isn't trying to any of his fans out here

1824
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,280
who has a really bad car that's worse than a go cart.

1825
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,560
We're not trying to shit on you.

1826
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,120
I'm not. I'm not shaming.

1827
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:27,280
But just take this moment as a moment of inspiration where it is like

1828
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,160
you need to get a better car than a go cart.

1829
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,120
If you're in the camp where it's like my car is not better than a go cart,

1830
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,800
then this is your wake up call.

1831
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,400
For safety's sake, for safety's sake.

1832
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,960
I have to wear a face sock and a helmet before I go anywhere.

1833
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,400
Every time I put on my business suit in the morning before my corporate job,

1834
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,280
and then I have to put on my face sock and my helmet.

1835
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,680
So my hair is so messed up by the time I get to work.

1836
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,360
I don't look presentable.

1837
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,560
And then I'm on then I'm on the freeway.

1838
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,120
It's taking me forever.

1839
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:02,240
And then a big truck just drives right over me entirely.

1840
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,320
I'm under the truck.

1841
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,640
I'm so sick of trucks driving over my car.

1842
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,800
I used I for for many years, I drove my dad's old Mazda,

1843
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,880
and it was like a 10 or 12 year old Mazda.

1844
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,920
And once it started to overheat and I took it to a garage.

1845
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,200
And like the next day, they called me and they're like,

1846
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:27,080
you never want to hear a garage say like, I've never seen this before.

1847
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,920
And the answer was pieces of the engine are like breaking off

1848
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,400
and going through the transmissions.

1849
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:38,200
Oh, it was like a total freak thing.

1850
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,640
The car is eating itself.

1851
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,960
Yeah, the car.

1852
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,640
The car was eating itself.

1853
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,720
It's like a mater had eaten his own like blood or something. Yeah.

1854
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,560
Well, you got to try everything once in life.

1855
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,880
I'm going to eat my own ass.

1856
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,520
I just get her done.

1857
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,080
Oh, shoot.

1858
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,280
Now I don't exist anymore.

1859
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,440
I ate it myself out of living.

1860
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:09,120
The summer before I was driving it, I just filled it up with gas.

1861
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,600
And as I'm driving, I start to smell gas.

1862
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,040
And I watched the gas tank meter slowly go down.

1863
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,400
And did you have a leak in the gas?

1864
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,800
It was there was a leak in the fuel line.

1865
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,520
And I took I took it to the to a garage.

1866
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,080
And the guy very similarly was like, wow,

1867
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:32,520
I don't normally smell the smell of gasoline working around cars as much.

1868
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,280
But I can really smell gasoline.

1869
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,920
Like you're driving a jug heads jalopy around town.

1870
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,160
Basically, here's what the car is drinking its own gasoline.

1871
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,440
The car is a junkie and it's trying to get high.

1872
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,240
So it's literally getting high up.

1873
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,240
Well, here's the question.

1874
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,280
Is gasoline a car's pee or is I guess?

1875
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,440
Oh, Mike, we don't have time for this discussion.

1876
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,240
I think we have a lot of time for this.

1877
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,120
I'm putting some coffee on.

1878
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:06,720
Nobody's leaving until we figure out if part two is K1 speed part two

1879
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,520
in a sec coming in a second.

1880
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,360
It is gasoline pee.

1881
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,040
Find out in part two.

1882
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,080
What a tease.

1883
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:20,240
I think it's like fresh water, like you'd get in a can of liquid death.

1884
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,440
P is or no gasoline.

1885
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,840
OK, cars got a hydrate.

1886
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,320
You want your car to be better than a go car and you want your

1887
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,560
sparkling water to be better than than pee or gasoline.

1888
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,560
Liquid death does have a piss flavor.

1889
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,800
But it's a little extreme, though.

1890
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,000
It's sort of an extreme brand.

1891
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,640
So like they're going to have a little some people.

1892
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:45,400
And once again, I'm not shaming some people might like drinking a big glass of pee.

1893
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,840
That's right. A tall boy of pee, please.

1894
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,640
I say when I go out on the town, I don't care.

1895
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,400
So, yeah, so what if we missed?

1896
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,400
We got we got to that is guess.

1897
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,760
Well, we didn't. We opened up the question of is the cars.

1898
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,560
We we left a cliffhanger for the audience.

1899
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,360
Yeah, we did.

1900
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,360
Started to open it up like Mike on a straight away behind a decommissioned

1901
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,760
NASCAR car.

1902
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,280
We agreed that we're all going to race in the desert in real supercharged cars,

1903
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,120
including Jason.

1904
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,400
Well, man yells at us. Yes.

1905
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:28,400
And other than that, we realized today that teens can be nice.

1906
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,520
That's the takeaway, everybody.

1907
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,000
I mean, we talked about about fast cars and driving and stuff.

1908
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,880
But the real takeaway from this entire episode is that teens can teens

1909
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,760
can actually be nice. Teens can be nice.

1910
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,440
And they they deserve a cup.

1911
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,600
They do their own cup.

1912
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,040
It's hard being a teen.

1913
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,720
It is. I was it was hard for me to be a teen in a lot of ways.

1914
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,360
Not always easier would have been if you'd gotten a cup.

1915
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,880
If I had a cup, if I if I proudly walked into my junior high

1916
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,840
with a cup raised over my head, I'm sure everyone would have been

1917
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,120
so pleased to see it and treated me better than they had been.

1918
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,000
I mean, but then in the contrary, if you walked into your home

1919
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,640
with a cup over your head, your mother probably would have took that cup

1920
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,880
and disposed of it immediately because having a cup over your head

1921
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,680
could be very dangerous.

1922
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,840
Yeah. If you were too weak to hold the cup and you dropped it on your head,

1923
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,000
giving yourself a concussion.

1924
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,400
Base is very heavy.

1925
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,360
Yeah, that's a very good point.

1926
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,000
I would have had to hide the cup from my mother for many reasons.

1927
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,160
Well, you won the teen cup.

1928
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,680
Your mom must be so proud.

1929
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,040
Uh, well, it's complicated.

1930
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,000
I would have had to say that the couple I won before being like

1931
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,240
it was not from go-karts.

1932
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,640
It was from like being the the handsomest teen or something.

1933
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,600
But then I couldn't have shown her the actual cup.

1934
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,560
I'd have to show her like a picture of what it would have looked like.

1935
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,800
Now, the cup is medium sized, right?

1936
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,440
Not big enough to fit over your head.

1937
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,080
Right. Yeah, yeah, right.

1938
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,280
Yeah, you literally almost can drink from it.

1939
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,520
It's like a drinking glass.

1940
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,120
Yeah, it's a small, it's handsome.

1941
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,280
But it says handsomest teen on the bottom.

1942
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,520
Why would they give you a big cup to fit over your head

1943
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,800
if you're the handsomest teen?

1944
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,640
It might fall over your head and then nobody could see how handsome you are.

1945
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,480
Well, that's I don't know.

1946
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,480
I have to talk about I'll talk about the head of the Teen Cup

1947
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,240
organization who hands out these awards.

1948
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,400
Hey, listen, this was a blast.

1949
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,680
Thank you. Thank you for bringing.

1950
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,920
Thank you for mainly for surviving our topic selection process.

1951
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,080
Right. We could be here as part of the show.

1952
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,440
Yeah. Well, once you know, once you get that's like that first lap

1953
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,040
where you're just like getting your bearings.

1954
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,400
But then when then once you hit a straight away,

1955
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,360
then it's nothing but fun. Right. Right.

1956
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,920
No, you're right. Right.

1957
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:44,400
Honestly, I am happy that this allowed you two both to experience

1958
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,440
go kart racing for the very first time.

1959
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,360
You have thrown me.

1960
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:55,360
At soon to be 38, I have as I have done the mainly child

1961
01:31:55,360 --> 01:32:01,400
and teen sport go karting now, and it's all thanks to you, Ronnie Adrian.

1962
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:05,120
I survived doing that and you survived podcast the ride.

1963
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,120
Thanks. Thanks so much for being here.

1964
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,080
And let's exit through the gift shop.

1965
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,880
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1966
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,240
No. I mean, well, I mean, bones, Adrian.

1967
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,320
That's what you get some Instagram.

1968
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,680
That's also on Twitter or whatnot.

1969
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:22,240
And, you know, Instagram mostly is if I was doing something,

1970
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:24,360
that's where you would find out. Sure.

1971
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,160
As the place to keep it tuned for future things to plug.

1972
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,000
Well, yeah, so fun having you.

1973
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:37,280
And as for us, hey, next week is the beginning of podcast

1974
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,600
the ride sin city nights.

1975
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,120
We head to Vegas next week.

1976
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,600
So I hope everybody's excited for that.

1977
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,280
And that, of course, means that coming up very soon is podcast

1978
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,240
the ride's big Vegas groove blender with Eva Anderson.

1979
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,600
You can come see that in person in Las Vegas, or you can watch the live stream,

1980
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,440
which you can find at the space LV dot com.

1981
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,480
And besides all that, there's there's, as always, the Patreon

1982
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,240
for three bonus episodes a month podcast the ride, the second gate,

1983
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,920
Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride.

1984
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,080
And I just this is a quick I didn't want to derail us

1985
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,280
because we were kind of on our way out the door.

1986
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:14,360
But I do want people to know that the owner of this of K1.

1987
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,640
Yeah, is a former

1988
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,360
NASCAR or clearly I don't know NASCAR versus Formula One,

1989
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,960
but a former driver named Boris Said.

1990
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,560
So that might be if you're getting legit racing thrills out of this place,

1991
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,080
that might be why you got a real racer at the head of the organization.

1992
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,480
But I I'd have to say that he did.

1993
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,720
Unfortunately, he did get into a heated incident

1994
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:46,880
with Greg Biffle at the 2011 Hell of a Good Sour Cream Dips at the Glenn.

1995
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,760
What did you just say?

1996
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,040
Well, the Boris Said, the owner of K1 Speed,

1997
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,200
got into a heated incident with Greg Biffle at the 2011

1998
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,400
Hell of a Good Sour Cream Dips at the Glenn.

1999
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,520
Are you not a hell of a good man, Michael?

2000
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,320
Now, have you heard it yet?

2001
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,720
Do you know? I know.

2002
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,680
I assumed it was a brand, especially by the exclamation point in the name of the

2003
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,680
it's a weird thing to name a race.

2004
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,400
I don't even see the part in the race title where it says, you know, race.

2005
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,280
It just says hell of a good the 2011 hell of a good sour cream dips.

2006
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,360
So sour cream. It's the brand of sour cream.

2007
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,880
It's the brand of tips, I think.

2008
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,720
It's a party. Yes. It's OK.

2009
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,280
I mean, well, it probably wasn't even his fault because I could.

2010
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,600
I know Greg Biffle and he I know he's a real hothead.

2011
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:38,760
So, OK, yeah, Greg Biffle can be a real hothead sometimes.

2012
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,840
You know what? I'm going to quote. You're not wrong.

2013
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,240
I'm going to quote Boris Said and say, I'm upset with Greg Biffle.

2014
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:49,400
He's the most unprofessional little scaredy cat I've ever seen in my life.

2015
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,840
He won't even find me like a man.

2016
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,560
If someone texts me his address, I'll go see him Wednesday at his house

2017
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,160
and show him what he really needs.

2018
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,040
He needs a frickin whooping and I'm going to give it to him.

2019
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,440
Totally unprofessional. Wow. Right.

2020
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,080
It was right. You you sensed he knew you know, it's Greg Biffle, though.

2021
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,600
So it's not surprising. Yeah.

2022
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,160
You know, I don't know him personally, but I just know of him.

2023
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:13,320
You've heard the reputation. Yeah.

2024
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:16,120
I know about Biffle. Yeah. Biffle needs a whooping.

2025
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,280
I don't know if it ever happened.

2026
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,640
Yeah, those are podcast to ride shirts.

2027
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,040
Biffle needs a whooping.

2028
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,480
On sale ceiling for those.

2029
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,680
It's so popular.

2030
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,120
And and, you know, for just doing wrap ups, unfortunately,

2031
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,760
the former Racers Edge did not hit their funding goal

2032
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,760
on fundable for the Burbank Lasertron.

2033
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,760
We never saw the Burbank Lasertron.

2034
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,040
How close did they get?

2035
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:47,680
It doesn't say doesn't say just that they're no longer taking donations.

2036
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,960
Well, now, everybody who didn't donate needs a whooping.

2037
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,680
They need a whooping to there's too many whoopens to go around.

2038
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,640
Oh, I'm ending this episode so mad.

2039
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,640
I'm angry too. Let's all go get whooping.

2040
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,640
I'm mad, yeah.
