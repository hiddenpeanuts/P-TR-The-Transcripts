1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Warning, the following podcast is a little intense.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,320
If you choose the Orange Team more intense podcasting mission, you may encounter turbulent

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,000
tangents about rides that are like Wounds, astronaut rap careers, and America's Daddy.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,800
For a less intense experience, Green Team is invited to choose another podcast.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
That's right, get the fuck out.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
As for you Orange Team, you'll definitely want to hang on.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,760
This is Mission Space on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,320
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast where one of the hosts recently tested positive

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
for Gary Sinise fever.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,240
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,640
I am here.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
It's going to be tough.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,760
I don't want to reveal the answer yet, but it does, if it means being excited about the

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,680
Lieutenant Dan band, then I don't know.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Think about it.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,080
Think about what we know about us.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,640
You know where some of my research time today was spent on a certain Wikipedia, but let's

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
see.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,720
Maybe it could be all three hosts who've contracted this.

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,000
Jason Sheridan, hi.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
I can safely say it's not me.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,520
The only thing I have recently tested positive for is the novel coronavirus.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
And there it is.

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,520
All right, poor Jason.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
It happened.

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Yeah, we're back on Zoom.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,320
I just wanted this, but I came back from Vegas a couple hundred dollars up and a couple

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,760
of one specific virus heavier, I guess.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
One virus up.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
So you're up.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Yeah, I'm way up.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
My damage was up.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
You could have got rid of that at a table.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Oh yeah.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah, only a couple hours the first night.

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,240
And now it's just been fatigue.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
OK, yes.

40
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,880
Now, yeah, nursing Pedialyte as we started.

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Got a big jug of Pedialyte there.

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Yeah.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
What flavor is it?

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Can I ask?

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,280
It's strawberry, but I think my favorite this week was blue.

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Blue Frost.

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Blue.

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Oh, wow.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,920
So they have all the different Gatorade type flavors for the Pedialyte.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,680
They do have, yeah.

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,200
In Pedialyte Advanced, they kind of up their flavor game a little, which my sense of taste

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,680
and smell only working at about 50 percent right now.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
So I can't fully vouch for Blue Frost.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,640
Oh my God.

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,800
So somebody could get away with leaving a pie on a windowsill.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Yeah.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Yeah.

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
All the pies are safe.

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Everyone has been much more pie-ed lately.

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:11,400
The five mile radius around your home is for once safe unless there are errant bears around.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah.

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,160
Well, we're glad you're doing pretty well, all things considered.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
I think.

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,480
Now, Mike, you had it a while ago and you seemed to...

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,080
I think I've had it a little worse than you.

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,120
You had a lot of canker sores.

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Was that right?

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
That was like an odd side of that for you.

70
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,720
The listeners will want to hear this detail about the fact that there were...

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,280
I on occasion get canker sores.

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
If you know what a canker sore is like, it can be pretty brutal.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,480
I decided, my body decided to get one on my tongue and in the back of my throat during

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,880
this situation.

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,920
Great that you say that because I have one on the very front of my tongue right where

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,040
it rests on the roof of the mouth and it's terrific.

77
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
It's a stress...

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,280
My body does that when it's under some sort of duress and it decided to do it during that

79
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
time.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,920
I remember we were talking about recording too and I was like, guys, I cannot talk.

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,840
I cannot speak right now.

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm not exaggerating.

83
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,640
It's like pretty crazy.

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
But yes, I...

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,880
Yeah, we lost two weeks because you could not...

86
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,920
Your voice was shot because of sore, not even the voice.

87
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
My voice wasn't shot.

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
No, no, no.

89
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
My voice wasn't shot.

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,080
When I tried to talk, the pain that would happen was so strong.

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,640
I would like punch a wall.

92
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,120
I was like an angry man in the 20s or something.

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,600
People punch walls still this day.

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
I know that happens.

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm not saying...

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,280
It's a tradition that's carried on even past to the 1920s.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Right.

98
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
I don't know.

99
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
I was just picturing it.

100
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
There was a real specific scene I had in my head when I was talking about this.

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
But yeah, it was insane.

102
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,440
So it was not that I lost my voice.

103
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,840
It was truly just that it was like having a big cut on your tongue or something.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,680
So when I look like this, I would be like, ah, like a scurril of yelling, trying to talk.

105
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,560
And I really only noticed it when I was like, oh, you know what a healthy thing to eat

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
during this time that my body would like?

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,840
Fruit salad with pineapple.

108
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,200
No, no, no, no.

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,800
And no, was not ideal.

110
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,080
Liked a cantaloupe and watermelon, did not care for the citric acid.

111
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Yeah.

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,080
It's an interesting situation, this disease.

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Everybody has a different twist on it.

114
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,120
And Jason's body decides to do a whole new fun little thing to deal with it.

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,200
And yeah, yeah.

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,480
So just do not consider throwing a banana into the mix that will blow up the entire.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
So we've got Jason got bananas here.

118
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,400
I still live on the edge.

119
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,840
You know, I recently got a drop off from Jane and Garfield.

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
So three bananas, three bananas.

121
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,840
Does she not listen to the show?

122
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,520
Does she trying to kill you?

123
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,320
I've got a I've got a breakfast burrito base for it to land softly on.

124
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
It's the base with Jason.

125
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Jason just cannot eat it first thing.

126
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,080
That's the problem with him.

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160
That's what came up before.

128
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,320
You've you've discussed before that your view of stomachs is that they need like a cushion,

129
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,000
like a lining, like like trampolines that would soften the blow of a stunt man

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
jumping off of a building.

131
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,480
Well, I saw some infographic this week that was like, if you're going to drink juice

132
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach.

133
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,840
You can upset your stomach.

134
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,800
So it might not be that far off.

135
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,680
That's what they're for.

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
OK, you've just OK.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,920
You've proven then that your body is like stunt padding.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,920
It's like, yeah, that's true.

139
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,400
What do you mean?

140
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,080
Our main source of modern information, Ikea, like dumbass infographics

141
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,320
that people just share around social media.

142
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,520
You know, when a dog eats something it's not supposed to.

143
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,360
Oftentimes, you're supposed to just give it a bunch of bread to coat its stomach.

144
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,520
So, you know, and bread is like the walls of it's like stunt padding or like

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,880
the walls of a hospital or something.

146
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,840
Right. Same thing. Yeah.

147
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,960
So, OK. So Jason, so next time you want to do something bad to yourself,

148
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,480
like a banana, just couch it in a big pile of bread, a nice cushion of bread.

149
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,600
Yeah. A big Sarah Lee, Sarah Lee, way bread

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,080
crash pad.

151
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,920
All of these all of these foods are would be like a delicious treat to an

152
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,640
astronaut coming out of hyper sleep, by the way.

153
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,560
They got to eat all that goo and dehydrated stuff.

154
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,240
That's the transition I was about to go into was like all this talk of something

155
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,320
unpleasant is perfect for the ride we're talking about today.

156
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,400
I got one more. I got a segue myself.

157
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,480
Go for it. Go for it.

158
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,000
My segue is that, well, so because of Jason's unfortunate Covid,

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,200
we're we're now back on Zoom, which means that we are glued to a screen

160
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,520
with very limited, uncompelling imagery.

161
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes. Much like happens on today's ride.

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
Yeah. We all had one.

163
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,200
We all tied it together.

164
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,880
I felt intermittent pressure on my skull on it all week.

165
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,880
Not to G levels, but, you know.

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
Something like that.

167
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
Yeah, I think this landed.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
I think this was meant to be.

169
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,000
I think this pairing of situation and attraction, I think it's

170
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,480
it's very apropos, we're talking about mission space.

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,800
It's come up recently because there was the talk of as there often is talk of

172
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,920
what is the worst attraction of all in Disney World, in this case specifically,

173
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,000
because over on the second gate, we talked about a wild mouse

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,640
that people are not too fond of called Primeval Whirl.

175
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,480
Although I found in the aftermath of the episode, there were a lot of defenders

176
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,960
and even we became defender.

177
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,960
So Primeval Whirl, I would say, is out of the running of Worst Ride for sure.

178
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,600
Yeah, I bet there's going to be defenders of this, too.

179
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,400
I think so. We've got one on this show.

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,160
I found out recently that I didn't even know about.

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
Well, OK. Yeah, because Mike, you kept offering

182
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,560
that you and Scott could just do this episode on your own.

183
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,040
And I said, Ah, no, probably I should probably rally and do it

184
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,320
because I'm the only one who kind of likes this ride of the three of us.

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
Or at least I used to.

186
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,720
I've had much more in the last 10 years, have had much more mixed results.

187
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,080
Wrote it in the last fall, wrote in twenty twenty one felt OK.

188
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Wrote it in twenty fourteen.

189
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,160
My entire family was like, Oh, I need a bench.

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,440
We just sit on a bench for a while.

191
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,200
What what happened?

192
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,000
It's a it's bad tales throughout for this thing.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
I did a little straw poll this morning.

194
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,040
I went to the Universal Studios and I ran into some friends of the show.

195
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,760
Julia Prescott, I saw said she was she got off the ride

196
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,240
and was chased by a cast member because she was she ran off

197
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,320
white as a ghost, like to either go sit down or I don't think she threw up.

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,320
But the cast member was so concerned that like, are you OK?

199
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Get back here.

200
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Ma'am, ma'am, get back here.

201
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,240
We need you to go again.

202
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,080
If you do it again, it counteracts the first time.

203
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,520
We'll spin it the other way.

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,520
This yeah, this so.

205
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,280
So I think it's I think our opinion is common.

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,240
But I'm sure there are defenders of mission space out there.

207
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
I think so.

208
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,720
We'll we'll we'll find them as we go.

209
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,080
And if you don't know why this ride is

210
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,640
embattled, I think that the basics of it,

211
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
if and if you don't know this attraction, it is a simulated trip

212
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,840
to outer space that involves a centrifuge

213
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,880
that is probably the closest that real astronaut training equipment

214
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,360
or vehicle or whatever you want to call it.

215
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,120
The closest situation has been to like consumers and regular people

216
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,760
getting to do real astronaut training.

217
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
So it's a tad intense.

218
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,880
And boy, we'll walk on eggshells about this.

219
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,480
But the ride killed a couple of people really early into the run.

220
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,280
And it was it was intense for everybody.

221
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,440
There were a lot of hospital trips and then killed a couple of people.

222
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,160
And then they had to back way off and do a less intense version.

223
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,560
Those are those are the basics of it.

224
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,720
But we can, you know, we can dive in more fully.

225
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Yeah, it's sending like I I guess I didn't even

226
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,880
I guess I didn't even know until I was looking into it, like this episode.

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,840
It is so like, I think, accurate to the experience of blasting into space.

228
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,160
I knew it was like they were going for accuracy and whatever.

229
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,400
But like it is fucking you up really good.

230
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,600
And that's like, obviously, like because you have like people

231
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,920
that train to go into space and need to be prepared for how bad it can fuck you up.

232
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,680
And it's like looking at the diagrams or what?

233
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,840
I forget which YouTube video I was looking where they're showing

234
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,640
what is actually happening.

235
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,520
I'm like, oh, OK, yeah, this is like hard course.

236
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,520
This is like unpreparedly sending every person into a like space camp, just

237
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,520
dashing everyone from young to old to not screening for any health conditions.

238
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,760
Just like, hey, get in the centrifuge.

239
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,800
Good luck. Like it's pretty wild.

240
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,160
And I know, like, obviously, like a lot of theme park rides

241
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
jostle you and throw you around.

242
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,320
But this thing is pretty when you really think about it, it's pretty nuts.

243
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,800
I agree. The video that I watched that had

244
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,640
it was even just a simulation of here's what it would look like, because, you know,

245
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,520
there's no vantage point where you get to see the ride

246
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,040
actually spinning and doing its thing.

247
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't think I realized that the individual capsules that you're in

248
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,480
on the edges of the centrifuge, that they also spin and rotate

249
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
and that you start the attraction on your back.

250
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,400
I don't I don't think I ever knew what was actually happening in the ride.

251
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,080
And I think if more people could see what it was doing, they wouldn't get on it.

252
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,760
It's a little creepy to see from an outside vantage.

253
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,400
You know, with with like rollercoats, with like the incredible Hulk,

254
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,440
you can see it from a mile away.

255
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,640
You can tell you can hear it a mile away.

256
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,720
And, you know, like, oh, that's probably a little intense.

257
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,640
Maybe I shouldn't ride that.

258
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,040
But this is I don't know.

259
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,360
It's an interesting thematic building.

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,480
It's it's tells you there's space involved.

261
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,840
But you literally go into like a room the size of a large living room

262
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,000
with these capsules like you don't really know what you're in for.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't know that it's like equivalent cheese to some launch coasters.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,560
You know? Yeah.

265
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,000
And it's hard. It's also like this is when you actually do the ride itself.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,880
For me, at least.

267
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,400
And I don't know.

268
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm sure everybody has a different experience.

269
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,960
When I actually do the ride itself, I can't I don't even notice

270
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,320
how much is happening to me.

271
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,080
I just know I don't like it.

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,200
I just know it's unpleasant.

273
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,600
Oh, this is a good question to open up because, Mike, you've been the most vocal.

274
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,240
And I don't think we said we at the end of this episode about Prineval World,

275
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,680
we were trying to land on everyone declared definitively what you think

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,320
is the worst attraction, at least at Disney World, maybe not of all time,

277
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,960
but at Disney World.

278
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,240
Mike, your answer pretty cleanly was Mission Space.

279
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,040
And I guess are you implying that it's less because of what it does to you

280
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,960
and more or equally because you just don't like.

281
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,360
It the the things that are said and the things that you're shown.

282
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,160
This feels like such a wrap up statement to make, but it feels like what the situation

283
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,280
and we haven't quite explained everything, but it feels a combination

284
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,560
because I hadn't done this for 10 years.

285
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,200
It was built in 2003 or open in 2003 and I did it in 2012 zone.

286
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,120
So they had basically we'll talk, I'm sure more about it,

287
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
but they had reduced the severity, the intensity by that point

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,400
and also had another version of it in the same ride where you could

289
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,760
where it wouldn't jostle you like barely at all, like a little bit.

290
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
So I was like, well, I got to do the real version.

291
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,240
The orange is right. Orange is the bad one.

292
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,960
Yeah, and yeah, yeah.

293
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,720
And I did it and I was so like my brain and my chest

294
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,200
felt so messed up after I did the orange one.

295
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,320
And then on top of it, I didn't even think the ride was.

296
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,280
I didn't think it wasn't fun to be in a little claustrophobic box

297
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,720
with a scott put it like underwhelming screens like it wasn't.

298
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Yeah. So it's like, you know what, if they're going to fuck me right up,

299
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
at least give me something to look at.

300
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,080
At least let's give let's give me a robot or something.

301
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,960
I was shocked when I did it and realized that that were

302
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,840
you're going to be looking at very little screens with at the time.

303
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,960
It's better now.

304
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,760
There's kind of a Mach 2 of it, but Mach 1.

305
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,320
The graphics were not good.

306
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
Let's be honest.

307
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,560
And like so I'm going to we're watching like a video game

308
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,840
simulator, you're watching like a roller coaster ride through essentially

309
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,800
like it's that somebody made in Planet Coaster, except it's simulating

310
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,320
taking you to Mars.

311
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,120
Yeah, I agree.

312
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,600
If it was a more dimensional experience, I think it would be more worth

313
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,400
the potential trauma.

314
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,160
The screen is like an iPad is bigger than the screen.

315
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,640
So I'm like, OK, I'm in a claustrophobic little box.

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,240
There's OK, there's buttons to push, which obviously as a kid,

317
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
we all like buttons.

318
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,160
We still I think we're all big buttons fans to press them.

319
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,560
I don't think there's any person out there that's not a fan of pressing buttons.

320
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,080
Make yourself known if you're out there.

321
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,120
But I think that's pretty universal.

322
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,560
Yeah, but maybe not.

323
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,440
But so so one of the things I like in Millennium Falcon is even though

324
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,240
not everything does something, there's so many buttons and stuff to push.

325
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,080
So especially if you were a kid, I think as a kid, that would have been nuts.

326
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,200
And the most exciting thing in Millennium Falcon is hitting the button

327
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,240
for hyperspace to go to hyperspace.

328
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,240
But here it's kind of I like the randomized nature of the buttons

329
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,760
in Millennium Falcon.

330
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,840
And here it's sort of you got one button on your left and one button on your right.

331
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,840
And it's a little confusing because in the pre-ride, you've been told,

332
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,320
do not look to your left or your right.

333
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,280
Yeah, so strict.

334
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,600
It's so strict and and I get it.

335
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,360
Like I get what they were going like.

336
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,680
You can admire that they were going for like a completely pure space experience.

337
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,400
No frills.

338
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
Yeah, you get a little senise and that's fun.

339
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,400
But it's not like it's not like you got a droid on the on the thing with you.

340
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,040
Sorry, you you did get senise.

341
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
Yes, I guess you did get senise.

342
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Senise recently recast.

343
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,800
Yes, I know. Yes, that's so less senise.

344
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,240
I mean, you still get intro video.

345
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
So it's not like, yeah, completely pure NASA.

346
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't think there are like pre-ride videos at NASA, but maybe there are.

347
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,320
Maybe there's like a video they wheel in on like an old VHS projector

348
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,480
and you like they put the VHS tape in and hit play

349
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,640
and they teach you how to be an astronaut that way.

350
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm not sure. But yeah, she's style.

351
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,840
Yeah, Chuck E.

352
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,120
Cheese break room style or cleaning the suit out.

353
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
How do you clean out the NASA suit?

354
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,000
Is it the same as cleaning out a Chuck E.

355
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Cheese head? I don't know.

356
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,680
What's the spray? They put like a 401 cleaner.

357
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,720
You have to spray that in the helmet.

358
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,120
I do remember someone I know who used to who did the college program

359
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
and was assigned a mission space.

360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,680
And I believe did have to do a lot of cleanup on this ride

361
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,960
because they eventually added barf.

362
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,360
They added they added barf bags.

363
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,800
I I I'm not 100 percent on the term.

364
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,520
I believe the term that they would use on the walkies was

365
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
we have a protein incident.

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
We have a protein incident.

367
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,680
I've heard protein spill.

368
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,560
Protein spill might be it. Yeah. Yeah.

369
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,960
It's just like generic enough, but unusual and specific enough that like,

370
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,920
hey, this means something.

371
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,120
But if people are walking by and they're hot and they're not paying attention,

372
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,960
they're not going to freak out, you know.

373
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,680
Right. Because I'm sure that happened because like after a while,

374
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,920
people might have been offended when it's like, oh, we got a kid

375
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,240
puking his guts out over here.

376
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,800
We got some lady that's just just hurled.

377
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,360
Some lady hurled on her kid over here.

378
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,560
We got to clean it up.

379
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,160
So they're like, all right, we got to change the language on this.

380
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,000
Got a human fire hydrant and capsule eight.

381
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,160
Yeah. Yeah. Is any.

382
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,440
And I know I don't think this is anywhere close to a Transformers.

383
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,800
I don't think there's like a versus going on here.

384
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh, wait. Jason is defender.

385
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,840
I don't know. But I think Jason, just chime in if you're disagreeing

386
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,280
with anything, especially it seems like Mike's maybe a little more extreme.

387
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,400
I didn't like it.

388
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,720
I certainly would not defend it.

389
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,760
But Jason, if you're as close as we have to a defender, what do you think?

390
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,560
See, OK, look, I'm an essay little freak.

391
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,760
I like G-Forces on a launch.

392
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,920
I like a roller coaster launch and I do.

393
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,160
No, not like not not done, not done.

394
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,480
No, no. I also and the opposite of claustrophobic.

395
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,960
I love to be in tight little spaces.

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
We like a cat.

397
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,720
You're a cat like a cat.

398
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,640
Yeah, like a cat, like in a little cardboard box.

399
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
They're like, what is that?

400
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
What is that called?

401
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,760
What is that called?

402
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,040
Claustrum? Is it like claustromaniac?

403
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,120
Mania claustromaniac?

404
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,640
You're a claustromaniac.

405
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm a claustromaniac.

406
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,080
I think it's comforting.

407
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,000
So like when that thing comes down, I I don't.

408
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm sure a lot of people go like, oh, fuck, what is this?

409
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,720
And fair enough, there I can't think of many other rides that do something like that.

410
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah, wait, let's explain what happens here, because

411
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,360
Erin was entirely unfamiliar and asked if she wanted to watch a video of it

412
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,600
right before we recorded.

413
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,000
And you get in your capsule that's going to spin around and simulate space travel.

414
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,640
But not just that, there's like a big panel in front of you.

415
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,320
And it's a small space, right?

416
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,760
It's already a small space.

417
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,640
And then, all right, time to go.

418
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,280
Let's let's seal her up.

419
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,320
And then the big the entire panel in front of all four guests in this capsule

420
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,200
slides right up against your face.

421
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,720
Your face is kind of shoved into a little cubby, a face cubby,

422
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,560
where you stare through and watch a screen.

423
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,200
And she just watching the video was like, nope, no, no, no, no, no.

424
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,840
It's it felt like an MRI or something.

425
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, like it freaked her out just to look at a video of it.

426
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,800
And I wonder how often if you like you have psyched yourself.

427
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,520
All right. I know it's a scary ride and I know there's been incidents.

428
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,800
And then that's the thing.

429
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,040
It's like I'm raising my hand. I am done.

430
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,280
Yeah, I think I was a little bit shocked by that.

431
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,360
And I'm not a big I am a claustrophobic.

432
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm closer to phobic, claustrophobic than claustromaniac.

433
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,160
So I think that's what you're going to do when the mission space capsule folds in on you.

434
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,800
And kids, you got to be healthy.

435
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,760
You got to eat your greens, eat your pasta and your tight little enclosed

436
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,040
space spaces.

437
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,320
You got to keep your protein inside your body, brother.

438
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,280
You don't want employees having to spend to clean that up.

439
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,400
Put your hand around your own neck to restrict your breathing,

440
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,760
to get an extra thrill when the mission space capsule closes.

441
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
That's no, that's not that's not Kari.

442
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,720
So these little you nasty little freaks.

443
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,160
That's great.

444
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,280
Can you hear that's great?

445
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,320
Can you hear is in the move?

446
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,560
It's sorry.

447
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,960
The it's not great.

448
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm an autofocus.

449
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,160
Yeah, I was talking to you.

450
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,920
Great. Can you hear an autofocus?

451
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,400
Yeah, I thought I thought he was making an autofocus joke.

452
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,200
Is it does it wait is Hulk into that?

453
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,760
Is that what that's referring to?

454
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,720
No, Jason said he was a nasty little freak and I just like, oh,

455
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,240
oh, that was off of the national.

456
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,560
I didn't know if that was some Hulk Hogan mythology that he's like.

457
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,200
No, I made a little bit of a leap.

458
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,320
Sorry, I went A to D and not A to C, as they call it in improv.

459
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,800
You did the more difficult mission, the mission orange.

460
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,160
Yes, that's true.

461
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,640
Rips. Yeah.

462
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,600
What were we saying?

463
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,800
Cluster mania. You're not a cluster maniac.

464
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,440
And so the folding in.

465
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,880
Yeah, yeah, you like it.

466
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,360
Could you let me ask you this?

467
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,000
Could you would you love a more enclosed space than even that?

468
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,360
Um, no, I mean, I think that's good because I don't I I, you know,

469
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,760
there's there is a little unnerving of like, I don't have control.

470
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,560
This ride is like just under four minutes long, so I do have to deal

471
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,160
if I start to not like it, you know, would you write?

472
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah. Would your ideal ride vehicle be that like

473
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,800
goo sack in the matrix that Neo comes out of? Oh,

474
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,280
I mean, I guess if I could breathe or anything,

475
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,480
too positive of a sound for the most terrifying thing ever.

476
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,520
You have the thing in your throat to breathe that.

477
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah, OK.

478
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,440
That I don't know about the tube and I need to like test the goo beforehand.

479
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,760
You know, it's like getting into a pool.

480
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,440
You got to dip your little toesies, you know.

481
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,920
What Jason's saying is that he wants a nice, warm, non terrifying space

482
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,680
to curl up in or maybe the goo is nice

483
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,760
and all of the breathing and maybe eating is done for him.

484
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,080
What he's referring to is a womb.

485
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,440
A womb. Jason's ideal ride vehicle is a womb.

486
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I almost said womb earlier. Yeah.

487
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
You'll take that with this, right?

488
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,200
Do you consider this ride vehicle like a metallic womb?

489
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,800
I, you know, well, daddy, I mean, daddy, astronaut, Gary Sinise.

490
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,240
But then now there's a mommy astronaut.

491
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,080
So I don't know.

492
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
I suppose it's a little womb like, but it's a little uncomfortable.

493
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm assuming you don't feel much discomfort in the womb.

494
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,400
If everything's, you know, going well.

495
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,080
So womb like, but maybe not directly womb.

496
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,680
The conditions of a womb is not what you're looking for.

497
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,160
But womb like is your ideal ride vehicle.

498
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,800
You know, I would say, you know, upkeep everyone,

499
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,960
even the big boys, Universal Disney, even they struggle with upkeep.

500
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,320
So I'd be real concerned with how quickly that goo goes downhill.

501
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,400
I mean, there's already Guardians of the Galaxy.

502
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,080
Already people getting dizzy off of that.

503
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,920
And there's like a one story stairwell that you have to go down to exit.

504
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

505
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,360
What? Yes. Someone just ate shit going down those stairs,

506
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,960
like landed on their like an older woman, like landed on her face.

507
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,920
Yeah. Other than this, are there any other womb like ride

508
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,680
vehicles on Disney or Universal property?

509
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Well, I find the doom buggy very comforting.

510
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Like that surrounds you on both sides. That's true. Yeah.

511
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,280
Tucks you in it. It folds up a little. It does.

512
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,400
Oh, we haven't even talked about that.

513
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
It's like a womb.

514
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,520
The Haunted Mansion tucks you in.

515
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,280
That might have been comforting as a child because I didn't like scary stuff.

516
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,120
But I love I love the Haunted Mansion, which got past the scary elevator.

517
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
You know, right.

518
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,800
You know, it's a womb like sequence is the because Doom Buggies, I hear you.

519
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,280
But then it's still there's you're going to do scary stuff.

520
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,160
But when you the one part where you're reclining

521
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,240
in the Little Mermaid ride and the projection of the bubbles is washing over.

522
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,040
Like you're you're supposed to be descending and the music is soft

523
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,240
and there's just Ariel's nice voice.

524
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,280
That's kind of a womb like sequence because you're on your back.

525
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,160
Yeah. I mean, I guess, yeah, you're descending like when you're going

526
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,520
into the graveyard on a mansion, you're also on your back.

527
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,720
But it's not as pleasant as it's a little. Yeah, it's not as pleasant. Yeah.

528
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,640
So, yeah, that's true.

529
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,240
The day today, the three boys discuss which ride is the most womb like.

530
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,680
Well, this look, I anytime we talk about a new category or a topic like this

531
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,520
after five years, I get excited.

532
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,040
I go, we haven't discussed this before.

533
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,400
Well, do you have a do you have an answer besides OmniMovie?

534
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,240
I think it's a really good call on Jason's part.

535
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
But anything else that's woomy out there?

536
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,680
It's a good question.

537
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,120
There's probably like a six flags thing.

538
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,840
The ride vehicles for Transformers and Spider-Man,

539
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,880
you know, when that comes down, you're you're pretty enclosed on that one.

540
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,560
But it's a little bit less, less intimate.

541
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,280
It's like if you're in the womb with octuplets. Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,640
It would be nice if there were a sleeper chairs on Soren,

543
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,880
you know, like little oh, yeah, or like benches.

544
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,960
Oh, like a long flight, like if you if you pay for a nice like a chaise,

545
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,400
like a is there a chaise lounge chair on Soren?

546
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,480
You can kind of lean back and really that would be awesome.

547
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,280
That's the only way to improve it.

548
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,800
Yeah. Already, you know, more relaxing rides.

549
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,760
That sounds nice.

550
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,720
If Galaxy's Edge had an attraction that was like the beast

551
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,360
that Luke burrows into, what is that?

552
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,000
The tauntaun. That's a tauntaun.

553
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah. If they had a enclosed yourself in a warm tauntaun experience,

554
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
that would be pretty close.

555
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,120
They make a sleeping bag of a tauntaun that you can really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,160
You thought they smelled bad on the outside.

557
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,920
I think I have we talked about that on the show?

558
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't know. Maybe we had a tauntaun sleeping bag.

559
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,840
Yeah, here it is.

560
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,240
There's a child dressed in full Hoth outfit, too, which is really funny.

561
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,680
Well, this is the I mean, Galaxy's Edge move over

562
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,080
because this is the most immersive Star Wars experience you could find.

563
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,080
You're literally swallowed by Star Wars.

564
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Oh, and he's cute, too.

565
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
The tauntaun is smiling.

566
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,600
Yeah, it's happy that it's been killed and is used for warmth.

567
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,800
This tauntaun died peacefully in his sleep.

568
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,640
OK, that's a good. Yeah.

569
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,880
You need to know that to feel good about it.

570
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,560
Lived a long and prosperous life. Right.

571
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,840
It was his time. Exactly.

572
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,560
Let me talk in terms of like ride

573
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,680
mechanic stuff and stuff that might be a deterrent to liking this attraction.

574
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,440
We have discussed G's a little bit thus far.

575
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,000
Something we don't talk about a lot.

576
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,800
I don't think we've had a lot of breakdown of G's because we aren't very technical

577
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,440
and we're not a coaster podcast.

578
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,760
And even now, there's not a lot I can say about G's.

579
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,800
But just the literal fact on this thing,

580
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,680
the attraction exposes riders to forces up to two point five G's

581
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,600
more than twice the force of gravity at the Earth's surface,

582
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,720
which feels like it is multiplying your weight by two point five.

583
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,840
That sounds intense, right?

584
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,800
But you hear that number and it's like two point five doesn't sound like a lot.

585
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,440
So I went digging a little more because this is not the most G's

586
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,840
that you can get at Disney World even.

587
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,200
Rock and roller coaster is five at the launch and the inversion.

588
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,960
So that's heavier in a G's sense, even in credit coaster

589
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,440
and probably anything with a loop in it, you're getting something like four.

590
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,360
But the big difference is those are over in a couple seconds.

591
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,920
In this thing, you're doing two point five G's for around 15 seconds.

592
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,480
So that's pretty sustained.

593
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,400
That is a long time to maintain being two point five times your body weight.

594
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,800
Right. And it's also like, I wonder if I could have handled it better

595
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,000
if Aerosmith was blasting on the ride on Mission Space.

596
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,480
Yeah, look, I you know, while you while your Aerosmith

597
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,400
affection is perhaps more than two point five times mine,

598
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,440
I do agree with you that Aerosmith music is something.

599
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
It's definitely something.

600
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,680
Yeah. As opposed to this ride, which is largely people yelling at you.

601
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,480
Right. Yes. You guys want to ride through it.

602
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,840
It is just like, no, don't. No.

603
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,520
Pull back. Yeah.

604
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,320
Stop. Wait. OK. Now. Right.

605
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,360
Is that why they there is the new mission captain?

606
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,880
And because she's a little more pleasant in her yelling at you,

607
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,040
he's a little less intense than Lieutenant Dan telling you what to do.

608
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,920
And a guy who can barely smile, his energy is just so

609
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,560
grumpy and then he's yelling at you.

610
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,880
No, not that button. The other. Yeah.

611
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,800
I mean, if he did it and and like, stop, tell me what's that sound.

612
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,880
Everybody like if that was playing too, it would be a little more like,

613
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,800
oh, well, I know what this is.

614
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,560
You mean if we did Lieutenant Dan, Dan band cover songs while you were playing,

615
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
you're trying to like calm you down.

616
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,280
Oh, you've got to step further.

617
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,120
I just meant if you play the album track, the regular Forrest Gump's

618
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,160
Vietnam music, now we're in a Vietnam.

619
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,720
Yeah, Vietnam music.

620
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,560
And then you're like, oh, it's Lieutenant Dan.

621
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,000
He's yelling at. OK. Right.

622
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,720
It's almost strange that it's like the one thing Forrest Gump

623
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,040
didn't do was go to space.

624
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,880
He accomplished anything else.

625
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,520
He did everything that a human could dream of doing in the 60s

626
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,040
and 70s and 80s, except for go to space.

627
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,800
I have not read the book.

628
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,440
He does he go to space in the book?

629
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,320
I don't know. There's a sequel book, too.

630
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,800
Oh, the sequel. Yeah, I would I would love to.

631
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,000
I should. Why have I never read the sequel, the sequel where he meets Tom Hanks?

632
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,280
Let me see Forrest Gump in space.

633
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,200
It seems like it could have been in number two screen rant.

634
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,240
Forrest Gump puts you with this means Forrest Gump.

635
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,680
He flies into space with a male orangutan called Sue.

636
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,400
Really? In the in the in the book that the movie is based on

637
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,520
or in the weird sequel, the events of the film can compare to Forrest's

638
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,680
wildlife in the book it's based on written by Winston Groom.

639
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,480
The novel version of Forrest Gump also sees Forrest become a pro wrestler,

640
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,360
a chess champion, a Hollywood stuntman, and in his craziest adventure,

641
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,000
recruited by NASA to fly into space with a male ape called Sue.

642
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,200
What? So there you go.

643
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,720
I can't believe I produced that thought.

644
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,080
And then it does exist in the longer.

645
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,040
Wow. In the true uncut Forrest Gump.

646
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,280
As it stands, it's one of the only Tom Hanks movies that does not involve space.

647
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,800
But yes, yeah, it had been allowed to fully breathe.

648
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,000
It would have to. That's insane.

649
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,280
Wow. I got to learn more about the adventures of Forrest Gump that we don't see.

650
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,120
That's really crazy.

651
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,000
I have one more thing to say about G's.

652
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And I think it will.

653
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,200
OK, what are the most G's you can get on a ride today?

654
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,240
And there's really a ride in Johannesburg, South Africa

655
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,280
that's called the Tower of Terror that just stole the name.

656
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,000
And on that, it's kind of a drop right.

657
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,040
I don't even understand where the G's are coming from.

658
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,320
But you're getting six point three on this thing.

659
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,520
So six point three is the most G's you can get on a ride in current day.

660
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,680
But that is not it for all time, because that stat was doubled.

661
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,680
You could get 12 G's on a ride called Flip Flap Railway.

662
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,600
What?

663
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,440
What are the finest names for a ride I've ever heard?

664
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:26,760
Wow. From that name, can you surmise that this is a ride that existed in the late 1800s?

665
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,320
Wow. This was 1895 to 1902

666
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,320
in a specific Coney Island zone called Sea Lion Park.

667
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,600
And the very dry G based website where I read about Flip Flap Railway

668
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,760
said that the ride sometimes broke riders necks.

669
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,200
Oh, my. For 100 years.

670
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,240
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

671
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,200
It went from 1895 to 1902.

672
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,800
So it was only it only broke.

673
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
It only broke necks for seven years.

674
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,480
It was a zoo. I misheard. Yeah. OK.

675
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,240
Seven years of broken necks.

676
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,000
Seven years, seven sweet years of broken necks.

677
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,320
Before the man came and said,

678
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,880
maybe people should still have used their necks after a roller coaster.

679
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,000
That's so many G's.

680
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,320
That's a lot of double what's available anywhere on Earth now.

681
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,320
Wow. What I wonder, like what like coming through space travel.

682
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,840
Did you did it say on there what the G's were like coming down, reentering, reentry?

683
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,000
That I don't know. No, I'm going.

684
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,240
There's I could consult a research document

685
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,240
that was recently released to the public called Top Gun Maverick.

686
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,920
That breaks down G forces and levels pretty strongly.

687
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,400
Flip Flap Railway would have like that would have wiped Miles Teller out.

688
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Until Maverick pushed him to his limit.

689
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,160
Oh, imagine imagine the theme park theme park,

690
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,240
reporters and bloggers and bloggers, you know,

691
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,800
podcasters of the time.

692
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,480
It's like, hey, hey, good time, boys.

693
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,680
I've got another bone to pick.

694
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,920
The Flip Flap Railway was down again when I went to Cody Island.

695
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,680
And the other half of Cody Island was on fire, as it always is.

696
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,920
I went on Flip Flap Railway and it didn't even break my neck as promised.

697
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,760
I feel I did not get the full experience.

698
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,120
There's like a guy who's like, I have the toughest neck in America,

699
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,200
and I'm going to challenge the ride to break it immediately.

700
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,920
Immediately breaks it.

701
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,720
I've been defeated.

702
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,160
That's that's how Houdini died.

703
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,320
He was like, you can just punch me in the neck.

704
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,720
It won't go. And then 12 hours later, he's gone.

705
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,920
That's right.

706
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,960
And a completely barely fact checked.

707
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,240
I'm seeing like 11 G's if some if somebody's like reentering the atmosphere.

708
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,560
What the fuck? 11.

709
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,160
I don't know. You could get 12 on a like fucking held together

710
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,600
with twine attraction in 1895.

711
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,960
I'm confused. Obviously, like we don't know what we're talking about.

712
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,960
But like apparently that's if like you're going like completely out of control.

713
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Reentry.

714
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,840
What are you?

715
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,480
So these ride the right the makers of Flip Flap Railway

716
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,840
exceeded NASA's capabilities.

717
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,480
They beat NASA.

718
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,320
And the ride, by the way, if you look at a picture of it,

719
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,840
it's just a loop and another loop.

720
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,400
It looks so I mean, but like way more severe, like,

721
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,680
you know how in credit coasters kind of like a perfect circle, it feels like.

722
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,720
This is such a like squished, severe, like, you know, from the shape.

723
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
This is bad news.

724
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,560
We're designed by Augusta Schlitterbond the first, you know.

725
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,680
Were G's different back then?

726
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,920
Was it like inflation where G's have gotten like less like

727
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,880
it's a reverse inflation with G's like

728
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,040
did 12 G's mean different things 100 years ago?

729
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,800
Oh, maybe. Or are they?

730
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,040
They sent like huge barrel chested divers on it.

731
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,680
Remember when we were looking at the shirtless photo of the guy

732
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,600
who voiced Fred Flintstone?

733
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,680
Yeah, that massive where you can have like, you know, a hundred pounds up in your pecs.

734
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,360
Maybe that was who was riding it.

735
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,200
So that tilted the scales somehow. Right.

736
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,640
The the other fact about this ride is that the Flip Flap Railway

737
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,640
was tested with sandbags and monkeys before human riders were allowed.

738
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,520
What the shit? Why?

739
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,720
What do you mean monkeys?

740
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,240
Where are you getting them from?

741
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,200
How are you?

742
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,880
How do you have enough access to enough monkeys to make go on a ride?

743
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,400
And how do you strap them into the same?

744
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,280
Like the bar can't lower on the same level between a human and this.

745
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,480
I, you know, maybe maybe we've reached the end of the history

746
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,720
or it's just beginning and there has to be the full Flip Flap Railway episode.

747
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,880
We have to do it. Yeah.

748
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,920
We have to figure out.

749
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,880
We'll learn more about Sea Lion Park either way. Right.

750
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,400
So anyways, the history of G's led me to a wonderful

751
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,600
town, a wonderful, wonderful railway full of flips and flaps.

752
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,800
Wow. 12. That seems great.

753
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,200
That seems wrong.

754
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,520
Yeah, I think so.

755
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,080
Maybe that was like eighteen hundreds braggadocia.

756
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,320
I don't know.

757
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,760
And just one more thing before we move on,

758
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,280
because in thinking about coasters being tested by sandbags, Jason,

759
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,160
in last week's episode, you were talking about

760
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,680
one of the coasters in your park that made you being tested.

761
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,520
And listeners have let us know that you said the phrase crash test dumpies.

762
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,520
And we did not stop to acknowledge.

763
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,560
I do remember. I do remember it, I think.

764
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,360
Just and I think I kind of remember, too, and I remember thinking,

765
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,280
well, you're he's barreling to something I don't want to stop.

766
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,360
But you are a real role.

767
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,200
And sometimes I'm like, don't be an asshole.

768
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,720
We know what he meant. That's fine.

769
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,680
I three days later, I had tested negative for Covid that day,

770
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,920
but was starting to feel pretty bad around then.

771
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,720
So I was a little I was drinking like, you know, a bunch of cold water

772
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,200
like so, like the next day I was a little woozy.

773
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,120
So you believe the fact that you covid on the fact that you said crash test

774
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,640
dummies? And no, I was just excited to talk about my hometown park

775
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,800
to talk about Playland.

776
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,600
I should I, of course, have had to move my trip eight days.

777
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,640
You call juggernaut.

778
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,600
You called juggernaut the junker not the other day, too.

779
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,720
And I called you out on that. That's fine. Yeah.

780
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,920
I don't know. Sometimes I just get too excited.

781
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,080
Yeah. No, look, this isn't fair.

782
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,640
We shouldn't pile on and make Jason feel like a dumpy.

783
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,480
I already feel like a dumpy. It's fine.

784
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,760
Does that does that sum up your covid experience?

785
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,000
It has the whole as the entire experience made you feel like a dumpy.

786
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,400
I feel I feel a little bit like an asshole whenever I talk to everyone

787
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,760
and anyone, because I'm just like, I'm so tired and I feel so lame.

788
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,800
But I've been saying it for days, but it is true.

789
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,440
Like this is the most the long prolonged sickness I've had in quite a while.

790
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,160
So Jason, from my experience, you've been saying I'm so tired for years.

791
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,080
Well, it's a different kind of tired.

792
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,000
It's got to assure you.

793
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,720
I I knew something was off because one day I heard a song and I

794
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,840
like the second day, like the first full day, I was like here.

795
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
And I was like dazed.

796
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,440
And I I heard a song and like, I think it was, you know,

797
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,280
a Spotify came up automatically or something.

798
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,560
And I was like, wow, this is a beautiful song.

799
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,640
I knew this at one point in my life, but I haven't heard this song in years.

800
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,280
And then I looked up what it was.

801
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,040
I realized, oh, wait a minute, it's just a fucking song from Drive.

802
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,840
This is the main song for the movie Drive.

803
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,560
Something I need to lie down.

804
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,240
I'm getting emotional from the drive song.

805
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,040
A side effect of covid is to get emotional.

806
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,960
It's movies.

807
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,560
So when I feel bad, I feel I feel physically bad for long enough.

808
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,600
I feel vulnerable and then I get emotional and, you know,

809
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,120
can I can I ask a question real quick?

810
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,200
Yeah, really a little bit.

811
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,720
But when you're sick, because this is a big thing between Lindsey and I,

812
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,440
sometimes where when I'm sick, I want to curl up in a corner of a room

813
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,840
and I don't want to see anyone for like days.

814
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,720
And some people are the opposite.

815
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,920
Some people want to be taken care of.

816
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,160
I was just wondering what your you want to go off like into the wood,

817
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,520
like a bear in the woods.

818
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,960
You want to die there?

819
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,680
I want to go off in the woods, not die.

820
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,160
But I do want to like go into like an old hollowed out tree stump

821
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
and just like lie there for three days and then reenter society.

822
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,800
Bear society. Yeah.

823
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,720
Yeah. I'll be again.

824
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm 100 percent the same way.

825
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,920
Is Lindsey the opposite?

826
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,720
Does she like to be taking care of baby a little and change the same way, too?

827
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,480
It is a men women divide.

828
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,720
I've talked about this classic gender roles. Classic.

829
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,280
No. Hey, let me refer you to a film called Phantom Thread.

830
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,600
That's true.

831
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,560
The most machis were the angriest man who just wanted to be a little boy

832
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,600
his scones and his bacon.

833
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,080
I Reynolds just need to be brought back down to earth as we all do sometimes.

834
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,560
Scott, if I could say you're talking about history,

835
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,280
um, can I talk about the Disney company in 2003

836
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,960
and that the environment this ride opened in?

837
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,720
Oh, yeah. Bad stuff ahead.

838
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,640
What's happening?

839
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:51,560
I got that Disney war book out of the library because Mission Space comes up in it

840
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,280
because everyone was mad at each other in 2003.

841
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Roy, Disney, Eisner, the board.

842
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,320
Everyone's just pissed at each other.

843
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,920
Oh, yeah. I was out what?

844
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,720
Like two, three years later.

845
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,000
That's right. And so I swore I could not find it.

846
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,600
I might have misremembered. It might have been a different event.

847
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,320
I swore they, you know,

848
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,840
did a truce for the opening of Mission Space.

849
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,920
They all put it aside to go to this ride opening.

850
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,000
And I could not find that in the book.

851
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,560
What I did find was that

852
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,200
at the end of the year, 2003 report,

853
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,920
Eisner celebrated Disney's big successes in 2003,

854
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,680
the Pirates of the Caribbean film and the new attraction, Mission Space.

855
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,280
Also in 2003, Roy, Disney was resigning from both Disney Animation

856
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,240
and the board of directors.

857
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,960
And I believe the shareholders did a vote of no confidence in Michael Eisner.

858
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,280
God. Oh, another funny detail.

859
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,280
This ride initially sponsored by Compaq computers.

860
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,560
Compaq soon after bought by HP,

861
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,560
which led to Carly Fiorina attending the opening.

862
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,160
If you don't know Carly Fiorina, she's one of those fucking business losers

863
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,640
like Meg Whitman or Howard Schultz,

864
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,000
who are the heads of companies.

865
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,640
And then they try to run for office and they never win.

866
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,120
And they just eat shit so hard.

867
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,880
So she was there.

868
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Yes. Yes.

869
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,520
Ladies and gentlemen, Mike embattled vote of no confidence, CEO

870
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,360
Michael Eisner and Carly Fiorina,

871
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,000
who has been booed at many Hewlett Packard events lately.

872
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,720
She I saw today

873
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,800
a list of the worst mergers of all time and coming in at number one.

874
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,320
What is the Hewlett Packard compact merger?

875
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,800
She was forced out of the company a few years later.

876
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,320
And then as you were saying, Jason, she ran for president

877
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,840
in the awful dogpile hell year 2016 that led to probably 2015.

878
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,760
But you know what led to to Trump

879
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,840
had Ted Cruz gotten the nomination, she would have been the VP.

880
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,880
No, come on.

881
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,880
She a person willing to align with Ted Cruz for any reason.

882
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,120
She major anti-abortion activist

883
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,240
and has said a lot of bad stuff about planned parenthood.

884
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,160
And this is a quote that I'm going to just try to read unaffected.

885
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,360
And there will be a reveal within this quote,

886
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,200
which television personality is talking to Carly Fiorina about planned parenthood.

887
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,320
So let me just dive in.

888
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,640
It'll be a fun reveal midway through.

889
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,240
This happened on television.

890
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,080
Carly, I need to stop you.

891
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,760
I need to stop you because you know that's not true.

892
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,160
Carly, you know, no one is harvesting baby parts.

893
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,480
No one is harvesting baby parts.

894
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,360
Carly, come on, girl.

895
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,000
Whoopi Goldberg interjected.

896
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,720
Oh, wow. They weren't harvesting baby parts, baby.

897
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,840
Wow. This was an exchange, presumably on the view.

898
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,320
On the view. So in the Disney family.

899
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,760
That's true. Yeah, she's still in the Disney family.

900
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,640
When Carly and Disney team up, great stuff happens.

901
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,440
Oh, my gosh.

902
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,520
Also, the the estimate from that HP merger.

903
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,400
I mean, this was just a quick look on her Wikipedia

904
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,880
was 30,000 layoffs and

905
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,640
I don't know, there's it could be 150,000.

906
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,680
It's so many that you would have you would have had.

907
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,840
I don't know.

908
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,320
I don't know what that 150,000 number is.

909
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,080
That's two out of it.

910
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,360
But that's still a lot for the vice president.

911
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,360
What is the vice president's accomplishments before taking off?

912
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,120
Oh, laid off 30,000 Americans.

913
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Proceeded a merger that some have said is the worst merger ever.

914
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,320
But, you know, that's that's that's some people's opinion.

915
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,280
You know, after you got through some incredible

916
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,040
opening moments from embattled CEOs,

917
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,600
then you got to party the night away at the opening of Mission Space

918
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,440
because there were performances by the B-52s and Sugar Ray.

919
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,080
And there's one bit of footage of it

920
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,400
that with the camera is just panning over like a blue ice pile

921
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,200
where shrimp cocktails are sticking out of the whole thing.

922
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,960
And you can hear distantly like 30 feet away,

923
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,160
Sugar Ray performing their cover of Is She Really Going Out With Him?

924
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,040
I know that song. I know that cover well.

925
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,240
Mm hmm. Oh, no.

926
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,440
How often is the last time you played it?

927
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,840
How often do you know?

928
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,480
I haven't listened to that one in a while.

929
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,200
I ended up you know what pops up more on my playlist?

930
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,480
Or when I put like I click on Apple or Apple Music or whatever it's called.

931
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,320
And it'll be like, I'm going to play stuff you like.

932
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,440
What will come up a lot is Sugar Ray's cover of Steve Miller band Abracadabra.

933
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,400
Jesus, Mike, what have you done to your algorithm?

934
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,760
For fuck's sake.

935
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,320
I know. Right. We understand this guy.

936
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,920
We the machines.

937
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,040
Let us give him the perfect offering.

938
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,360
Do you, Scott, let me ask, do you like the song?

939
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,640
Just Steve Miller's version of Abracadabra?

940
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,600
I do. I don't choose to listen to Abracadabra really.

941
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,840
But yeah, I like it.

942
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,000
I would. You know, after we're done, I'll listen to it.

943
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,320
But Sugar Ray, that's one of those where they don't really like add anything.

944
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,960
They just do it. Oh, no. Yeah.

945
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,320
No, no, there's nothing.

946
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,680
There's not much of a flourish or anything like a special Sugar Ray sauce

947
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,560
they put on it or something, or it's not hard.

948
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,600
It's not hardcore or anything.

949
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,600
Are you insulted then by the algorithm or is it like, yeah, all right, get in here.

950
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,640
You got me.

951
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,960
Yeah, I'm usually I'm usually looking at the algorithm on my phone.

952
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,360
I'm go, you got another one.

953
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,960
You're right. You are. Yep. You're right.

954
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,920
I do like I do want to hear this.

955
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
You know what? Should we just see what it comes up with?

956
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,200
Yeah, yeah. Go to you, guys.

957
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,040
Let's see what happens if you just go to like, don't just read them all.

958
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,640
What's what's a it might be good.

959
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,800
It might not be good, but I'll come to the first one that'll like be worth talking about.

960
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,040
OK, I play it.

961
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,080
OK, the first one is a solo song by the Bare Naked Ladies, Steven Page.

962
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,760
A song called Shooting Star.

963
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,080
Yeah. Let's see.

964
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,800
There's a Wilco song. Oh, it's too cool. God damn.

965
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,240
Abandoned Luncheonette. Oh, my taste is too good.

966
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,880
It's all a note song. It's defeating.

967
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,360
Yeah, I know. I like like man.

968
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,840
All right. Well, look, sometimes here's what's good about the Apple music algorithm

969
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,240
when it's telling you what you would want to hear.

970
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,440
Sometimes it's like that.

971
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,120
And then sometimes if you're like me, who does listen to like

972
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,080
all the Matchbox 20 albums, it will just give you the hits from like the night.

973
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,760
It'll give you like tell Bachman she's so high.

974
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,960
What I was really hoping for, like the jewel that could have come out of that was like

975
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,680
it's a cover of who I want to be like you from the Jungle Book by Alien Ant Farm.

976
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,880
That'll happen, too, though.

977
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,160
Oh, down at the Lottie Dab by Jimmy Buffett has just popped up.

978
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,120
All right. OK.

979
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,080
Now we're now we're in the territory.

980
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,920
Let's make sure we talk about some things on the ride.

981
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,040
One thing we haven't talked about is that this the like unpleasant trade

982
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,160
that happened here where this was done in the space formerly taken up by Horizons.

983
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,680
We did an episode about it.

984
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,000
Very pleasant ride.

985
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,840
Really just nice forward thinking, hey, the future will be wonderful

986
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,240
kind of ride. And then it fell into disarray.

987
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,920
Or so they say.

988
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,600
I even saw a press conference where

989
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,680
from the channel Martin's Vids that we consult with sometimes.

990
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,720
And they some executive is in a like pre written little skit

991
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,240
saying to Michael Eisner, we have an attraction.

992
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,960
We're so excited about that.

993
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,440
The the building we currently have wouldn't be big enough to to fit it.

994
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,600
And then Martin's Vids puts a title on to editorialize.

995
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,160
It says actually the Vision Space building is smaller.

996
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,120
But anyway, go ahead.

997
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,880
The video I watched also says and that was a blatant lie.

998
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,000
Like there were also that's a big thing, I guess, in all these videos

999
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,280
to make sure you know that Disney lied about the size.

1000
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:43,880
The thing that hit me like looking looking at this ride was realizing how like, huh?

1001
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,440
Horizons pretty.

1002
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,720
I don't know if the right word to use, but pretty whimsical,

1003
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,560
like a pretty novel view of the future.

1004
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,320
It's like if we keep going down this path, you know,

1005
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,240
if these innovations keep going this way, this is something we could have.

1006
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,640
It isn't that neat.

1007
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,960
And, you know, the the building also very like whimsical,

1008
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,280
like interesting architecture.

1009
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,560
And this I kind of like it.

1010
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,800
I kind of like the front.

1011
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,360
But I'm like, yeah, but that Horizon building looks so cool from a distance.

1012
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,480
You know, I do like the Mission Space building.

1013
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,480
I hate on mine.

1014
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,960
I think it is funny because I think like I appreciate it on some level

1015
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,520
what this was trying to do because it was trying to make it a very accurate

1016
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,600
experience, make it something like.

1017
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,320
And I assume they were like thinking, oh, this could this could inspire

1018
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,920
a generation of people that want to go to NASA and train to be astronauts.

1019
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,840
And maybe it did.

1020
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,960
And maybe somebody out there who is an astronaut now will say that that's

1021
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,240
what happened. But I feel like more people were like inspired to do stuff

1022
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,880
like be an astronaut or go and be a scientist or something by crazy,

1023
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,160
nonsense, bullshit like Star Trek.

1024
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,840
Like you hear that a lot where somebody was a, you know,

1025
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,680
a big Star Trek fan when they were little and then they went to they started

1026
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,560
like training to be an astronaut or they studied whatever astrophysics or something

1027
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,680
like nonsense.

1028
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,880
When you're a child, that's fun.

1029
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,920
To me seems like it's probably it could be rooted in some reality,

1030
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,560
but it feels like it probably would inspire kids more than putting them

1031
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,440
in a little box and accurately simulating what it's like to go into space.

1032
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,040
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

1033
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,120
I mean, why?

1034
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,360
I don't understand why this couldn't have been more fun because there are

1035
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,600
there are logic leaps like you do.

1036
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,400
You do a hyper sleep of three months in a in the blink of an eye.

1037
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,400
Because you go to Mars. Yeah.

1038
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,880
So they have to do silly stuff and then kind of a star tour thing

1039
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,760
happens at the end where you go up to a canyon and what?

1040
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,160
So they're all they're a little bit there.

1041
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,720
And then otherwise, it's such a dry,

1042
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,040
clinical kind of experience that, yeah, I agree with you.

1043
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,360
I don't know that that's going to make people want to join the program.

1044
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,840
Yeah. And maybe it's maybe somebody will disagree.

1045
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:14,400
But I wonder how much was possibly planned of like, there's not in this attraction.

1046
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,000
Of course, there's not so right.

1047
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,240
There's a rise in references here and there, especially the the logo, the icon.

1048
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,840
But there's also props and some nods to the 2000 movie

1049
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,720
Mission to Mars itself, a reference to the attraction Mission to Mars itself,

1050
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,200
a sequel to Rocket to the Moon.

1051
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,320
And I'm wondering how much when they were making that movie

1052
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,000
Mission to Mars that came out in 2000, a few years before this,

1053
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,800
how much were they like, this is a hit.

1054
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,520
This is a big hit.

1055
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,960
We get a ride out of this, you know, we get an attraction out of this, you know.

1056
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,840
And then this kind of is what came out of it, maybe where it is.

1057
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,320
I wonder if they would have made it like it is Mission to Mars, the ride.

1058
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,960
But then it didn't really land.

1059
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,480
But maybe they kind of casually promised Gary Sinise on the set.

1060
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,200
Hey, and we're doing a space ride and we put you in it.

1061
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,560
You can be your famous character.

1062
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,480
You're the your widower character.

1063
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,920
That is the only fact that I saw about Mission to Mars.

1064
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,440
You can be your widower again in the line.

1065
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,120
They did some like like what year was the movie Mission to Mars?

1066
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,160
2000, 2000.

1067
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,080
OK. Yeah, I think I'm trying to think there was a guy.

1068
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,040
You probably have this already.

1069
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,360
There's a specific video where they were hyping this right up,

1070
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,360
where I maybe I'm misremembering what they were talking about,

1071
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,200
but there's some famous people in it to talk about.

1072
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,120
I think you do have this.

1073
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,080
I think I do. But do what you were going to.

1074
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,280
Well, no, we'll do it later. Actually, it'll be better.

1075
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,680
OK, to do it later.

1076
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,080
I wonder if we have the same thing.

1077
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
It's probably the same thing.

1078
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,600
But anyway, well, here, let's let's talk a little about the pre show is nice

1079
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,040
and that big rotating wheel thing that is left over from Horizons.

1080
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,800
Correct. That's a prop that they repurpose.

1081
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,800
But pretty quickly, you're into

1082
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,920
the pre show with with Gary Sinise, where he's your Gary Sinise

1083
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,160
is your Capcom. He's the Capcom.

1084
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,200
And he's going to tell you some stuff about how this is going to go

1085
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:14,040
and that the mission is going to take three months, which is very jarring.

1086
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,760
Here's you know what? Let me just generally say about Sinise.

1087
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,640
I remember thinking at the time, all right,

1088
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,240
Disney's thing right now is to use all of these kind of character

1089
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:30,720
actor guys that a lot of people would recognize, but you couldn't necessarily name.

1090
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,240
And like Gary Sinise, probably pretty nameable.

1091
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,400
But, you know, he's in there with we've talked about a lot of these other ones.

1092
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,080
Wallace Langham and John Michael Higgins and Patrick Warburton.

1093
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,280
And I just remember thinking Gary Sinise is my least favorite of these,

1094
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,680
of the Just a Guy actor who started appearing in rides in the early 2000s.

1095
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,360
I think this is a a flat performance.

1096
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,280
I think he does not seem excited.

1097
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,600
It does not hype me up to be there.

1098
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,000
It just kind of adds to the clinical nature of everything.

1099
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,840
But but so I guess I've just added myself as the one who didn't test positive

1100
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,080
for for Gary Sinise fever.

1101
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,480
Did anybody who's excited about is anyone excited about Gary Sinise in this ride?

1102
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,200
That's a good question. I don't know that I'm excited.

1103
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,160
I mean, it's I would say it's a little unfair to Sinise,

1104
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,920
I think because you're also planting him in this ride.

1105
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,600
Like if Sinise was in the pilot's outfit on Soren,

1106
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm not saying it would be better or even as good as Warburton.

1107
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,640
But give me some of those lines.

1108
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,920
I would like to see what he would do with the I would like to see what he would do

1109
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,200
with it, which this is kind of a funny thing to like recasting,

1110
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,240
like recasting videos, like pre show videos with different actors.

1111
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,200
You know, like what if, which is a funny, you know, what if.

1112
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,160
So I think if you give Sinise, if you planted Sinise

1113
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,000
with the dialogue of these other pre show rides,

1114
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,680
I think you're going to be a little bit more excited about Sinise.

1115
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,800
Huh, huh. But isn't but doesn't he land where he's supposed to?

1116
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,240
Like, he seems pretty humorless.

1117
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:07,600
I can't recall seeing Gary Sinise in a scene where he's cracking a joke.

1118
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,840
Is there a screwball sex comedy that Gary Sinise is in that I can't think of?

1119
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,320
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

1120
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,920
Did he end up getting a part over Gutenberg or something that I'm not aware of?

1121
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,400
I what is let's see.

1122
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,400
He's on CSI New York, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13.

1123
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,440
He's in Ransom. These are all laugh riots.

1124
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,680
What are you talking about?

1125
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,440
Well, he kind of he see like smiles in Forrest Gump as Lieutenant Dan.

1126
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,680
If that's something. Yeah.

1127
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,800
Yeah, I guess there's not a lot of goofing around with Sinise.

1128
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,040
And I hear what you're saying.

1129
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,920
You want a little of that, but that's the tone of this ride.

1130
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,160
The tone of this ride is not goofing around.

1131
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,480
You want to you want a serious man.

1132
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Yeah, it is a serious guy.

1133
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,040
I think if you put Patrick Werber and it as this part,

1134
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,800
it is a little more fun.

1135
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,240
It's a little more, you know, a little more wild.

1136
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,640
They watch out for protein spilled, buddy. OK.

1137
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,480
Yeah, exactly. And that's good.

1138
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,240
But it's not the tone of the ride.

1139
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,000
You're right. It'd be it'd be out of place.

1140
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,040
Look, I'm just going to as much as I want to talk about things on the ride,

1141
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,520
I of course was like, I have to come up with

1142
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,760
I have to find something new about the Lieutenant Dan.

1143
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
Oh, there was no way to not.

1144
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,080
And, you know, the lieutenant as look, as with the rest of Sinise,

1145
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,800
it's pretty serious, right?

1146
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,120
It's a little bit mockery proof because it is a good thing that they do.

1147
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,800
It's like USO tours and right.

1148
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,160
They do perform for the troops.

1149
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:45,040
But there's one interesting thing I found about the Lieutenant Dan Band.

1150
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,360
So on the Wikipedia for them, there's a list of like honors

1151
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,000
that they received, like awards because they're given these, you know,

1152
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,600
here's this Bob Hope humanitarian thing or here's the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.

1153
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,640
And then at the end of the Wikipedia, the list of awards,

1154
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,600
it says that in 2016, Mr.

1155
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,520
Sinise was awarded the National Daddy Award.

1156
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,360
Well, look it up.

1157
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,080
It's there in the Lieutenant Dan Band Wikipedia.

1158
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,280
He was unless I'm hallucinating, this is the beginning of my covid.

1159
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,560
I swear to God, it said that he got the National Daddy Award.

1160
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,320
What? So I am immediately OK.

1161
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,400
The National Daddy Award. Tell me more.

1162
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,000
I Google the phrase National Daddy Award with quotes.

1163
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,280
And the only results that I find are related to the Lieutenant Dan Band

1164
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,360
and the alleged awarding of the National Daddy Award in 2016.

1165
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,400
Wow. What?

1166
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,160
So I yeah, I so I'm beginning to question whether or not the National Daddy Award

1167
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,560
is a legitimate.

1168
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,800
Oh, yeah. You look it up.

1169
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,120
It can be given the pick.

1170
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,520
The first picture is Sinise playing that bass.

1171
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,960
Uh huh. Uh huh.

1172
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:02,040
Potentially the only National Daddy Award ever given unless it was not given.

1173
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,040
What I'm starting to wonder is, is this some prank that I'm not understanding

1174
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,400
on the Lieutenant Dan Band?

1175
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,320
However, even with that, I love the phrase so much.

1176
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,640
I'm in love with the National Daddy Award.

1177
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,680
And if it look, if it's all stolen valor

1178
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,840
and nobody's the recipient of the National Daddy Award, then it I say it's up for grabs.

1179
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,080
So what I would love is, look, I have a Wikipedia page

1180
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,760
and I don't know.

1181
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,600
I don't really know about editing Wikipedia pages and I don't know.

1182
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,440
I think that's not even right to do to do yourself.

1183
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,920
Right. However, if there are listeners who like to edit Wikipedia

1184
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:48,240
and you would be willing to say that Scott Gardner received the National Daddy Award,

1185
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,400
it would be my honor.

1186
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,120
It would be my highest honor to be to fall in line with Gary Sinise

1187
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,600
and accept the National Daddy Award.

1188
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,480
I think that's great.

1189
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,680
And if anyone wants to add that he is one of three Disney daddies with a Z also,

1190
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,360
just you don't have to put that part, but

1191
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
you could set up a different website and that is the source of it.

1192
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,320
Yeah. And I wanted to ask you guys about it just to brainstorm this,

1193
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,840
because I really do want this.

1194
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,800
Is it better if I got the National Daddy Award, like in twenty twenty one,

1195
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,920
after which I became a daddy?

1196
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,240
Or is it better if I got it right after Gary Sinise?

1197
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,320
Like if the Wikipedia said

1198
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:36,120
in twenty seventeen, Scott took the crown of the National Daddy Award from

1199
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,320
Scott. I'm sorry.

1200
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,960
Wait, you have to put it really dry to get away with it, I think.

1201
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:46,160
In twenty seventeen, Scott succeeded Gary Sinise as the recipient

1202
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,200
of the National Daddy Award.

1203
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:54,480
I you know what I love is when a restaurant will be like voted best pizza

1204
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,520
in the city.

1205
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,480
Two thousand seven, two thousand eight, two thousand ten, two thousand eleven.

1206
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,960
Where like there's a like what happened in two thousand nine.

1207
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,920
So I would love a skip year if you got it.

1208
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,160
Two thousand seventeen, two thousand nineteen, twenty twenty one.

1209
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,680
And it's like, what happened those even number years?

1210
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,920
If you look at and I'm sure this works for baseball championships,

1211
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,640
any sort of sports thing.

1212
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,840
But if you look at like a wrestling pro wrestling Wikipedia,

1213
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,760
a wiki type thing, it'll have a list of like intercontinental champions

1214
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,440
and it will go down the list of like who won it from who and then like

1215
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,240
what date it was.

1216
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,760
So, yeah, if you could get you, Sinise and then you under it

1217
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,080
and then maybe, yes, Sinise gets it back, like Sinise the next year,

1218
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,840
then you get it the next year.

1219
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,880
If it's mainly like kind of a little a little chase between

1220
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,080
you between me and Sinise, but be creative, throw it

1221
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,960
whoever you want into the National Daddy Award.

1222
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,320
I'd say maybe leave out Josh Demaro because he'd be more

1223
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,520
the recipient of the National Daddy Award.

1224
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,720
Oh, yeah. But yeah, just just whoever you think of when you think daddy

1225
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,200
and whoever reminds you of me and Gary Sinise.

1226
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,840
There's a real whoever else fits in that mold.

1227
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:13,360
The Daddy Awards have been going a long time and a lot of Disney CEO

1228
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,720
E. Card Walker won it in 1970.

1229
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,440
It's been primary. Yeah, Ron Miller.

1230
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,520
Yeah, it's been primarily Disney CEO.

1231
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,760
The National Daddy Award respects the space of the National Daddy Award.

1232
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,880
They they write different things and they they even like host

1233
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,200
events together, banquets.

1234
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,280
They're not enemies.

1235
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,160
So don't don't don't put them against each other.

1236
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,040
That's not the. Yeah.

1237
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,760
Hopefully somebody will let us know.

1238
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,760
Please take me up on it.

1239
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,960
But don't you know, be dry because otherwise Wikipedia might flag.

1240
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,440
Just make it as because it like almost I almost glazed over that

1241
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,120
in the Lieutenant Dan Band article.

1242
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,400
I almost went right past National Daddy Award

1243
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,920
before it became 15 minutes of this episode.

1244
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,440
Now, yeah, we got to I'm assuming you look like was there a ceremony?

1245
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,760
Was there a press release like it feels like if it's on paper,

1246
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,680
if it's just they sent a certificate, that's different than if there's like

1247
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,080
a party at a Dave and Buster's, you know?

1248
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,920
Yeah, yeah, I think it's like a mid level.

1249
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,040
Like they film it, but just kind of for industry, it's not televised,

1250
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,400
but they like they do it up nice and there's like a hearty chicken dinner.

1251
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,200
You know, all the daddies, all the daddy nominees get their due.

1252
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,040
I don't know who hosts the National Daddy Awards.

1253
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,840
Is that like a who's like who's who do we think of when we think of America's dad?

1254
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,640
I mean, America's dad, that's a phrase I think of.

1255
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,920
And I think I can't think of a person specifically.

1256
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,280
Wait, wait, does that mean you are thinking of someone as American?

1257
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,640
It means I'm thinking of Bill Cosby. Yes.

1258
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,360
Oh, oh, that didn't occur to me.

1259
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,480
America's dad, not America's daddy.

1260
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,720
I thought you were talking about Stan, the main character in American Dad.

1261
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,680
Well, I think about him, too, but I sorry.

1262
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,240
That's it. It's a fun.

1263
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,560
It's hosted by it's like they comp in in

1264
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,160
there's a live, oh, yeah, yeah, an animated American dad.

1265
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,880
That's great. But he's still daddy.

1266
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,920
He's not daddy. Yeah.

1267
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,440
Well, who's America's daddy?

1268
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,480
What? Who's America's daddy?

1269
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,520
It's a good question. Yeah.

1270
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,560
It's a hard line to parse.

1271
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,000
There was a what show in the 60s called Make Room for Daddy.

1272
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,240
Oh, yeah. Who is that?

1273
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,200
Is that Danny Thomas?

1274
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,400
That Danny Thomas?

1275
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,800
I was trying to remember who there's I was like, is it somebody from the

1276
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,120
from like Daddy Daycare 2?

1277
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,760
And then I'm looking that up and everyone involved is problematic.

1278
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,280
In the film Daddy Day Camp.

1279
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,760
So it's not them.

1280
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,880
OK. You've Daddy Day Camp out of it.

1281
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,560
Wait, isn't that other movie?

1282
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,880
Wait, what's Daddy's Home? Oh, Daddy's Home 2.

1283
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,800
No, no, no.

1284
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,080
Sequel has problematic people. No.

1285
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,600
I know what you mean.

1286
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,720
Mark Wahlberg can do it. Mark Wahlberg's in Mark.

1287
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,040
Oh, yeah. He's never done it.

1288
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,240
Nothing problematic.

1289
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,080
Yeah, nothing bad about Father Stu.

1290
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,200
That's America's daddy, Father Stu.

1291
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,640
OK, well, now we can all agree on that.

1292
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,240
Well, let us know.

1293
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,080
It's tough to decide on the spot.

1294
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,080
Let us know who you think America's daddy is.

1295
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,600
But anyway, back to mission space.

1296
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,760
I let's well, let's talk about this, that for a long time, it has not been

1297
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,120
Gary Sinise. There was a redo of this attraction.

1298
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,480
And who is that new Gina Torres?

1299
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,680
Is that correct? Yeah, I think so.

1300
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,080
I think she is great. She's good at it.

1301
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,240
She's on Suits.

1302
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,440
She was on Suits with Meghan Markle.

1303
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,960
And as we all know,

1304
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,400
the star of the Suits spinoff, Pearson,

1305
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,480
which is, of course, the last name of her character, Pearson.

1306
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,800
So it's Gina Torres from Pearson.

1307
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,880
Wow. I didn't know that existed, believe it or not.

1308
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,560
That's one of those these alternate dimensions that we all exist in.

1309
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,960
We're like on our side, it's like the only shows that exist are Barry and Hacks.

1310
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,160
And then the other side has never heard of Barry and Hacks.

1311
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,720
They're entirely about Suits and Pearson.

1312
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,440
We're the liberal bubble here.

1313
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,640
We don't know anything that happened to Gary Sinise on CSI.

1314
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,800
Friend of the show Buzz Buzz talks about how we're all in our own bubbles,

1315
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,160
in our own realities, a very unique theory. Yes.

1316
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,040
But he he does not even listen to the show.

1317
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,800
It does not know the run. He just said,

1318
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,280
I mean, the only thing anybody really watches is Yellowstone.

1319
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,920
So wise words that we ourselves have said.

1320
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,760
And yet Mike continues to defy and I am going to get to it.

1321
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,200
Is Gary Sinise been on Yellowstone yet?

1322
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,680
That seems ripe.

1323
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,160
Seems ripe for an entire Yellowstone.

1324
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,200
Yeah, one of the spin offs, I would think.

1325
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:01,280
That is an anecdote I only like half half remember from the Disney

1326
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,960
war book where they're talking about, like because they just had so many

1327
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,920
like fine live action middle of the road movies.

1328
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,840
And they're like, oh, what?

1329
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,680
You have a big awards movie or what?

1330
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,080
What do you want? You want another cowboy movie?

1331
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,200
Kevin Costner, like said, dismissively.

1332
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,600
And it's like, wow, cowboy movie might not have worked,

1333
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,120
but cowboy TV show seems like it's working fine.

1334
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,360
See, cowboy TV shows, the only thing like keeping Viacom around.

1335
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,160
It's like doing better than all the other ones because of one cowboy TV show.

1336
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,080
One cowboy TV show.

1337
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,240
I anyway, here's here's my big takeaway from, I'd say actually,

1338
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:45,240
especially the Gina Torres version, and I'm not sure if this was done

1339
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,760
specifically with the let's make sure people don't get on Mission Orange

1340
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,840
unless they know what they're getting into.

1341
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,360
I feel like they ramped it up because we're what there's

1342
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,200
there's like the bigger screen that you watch before you go into the little room

1343
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,160
where the capsules are and then you watch another little video there.

1344
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,200
And these videos, I swear to God, over and over.

1345
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,480
It's just like now, remember, this one is intense.

1346
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,760
You have chosen Mission Orange and that is intense.

1347
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,240
And if now is the time for you to tell a crew member that you want to go,

1348
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,320
then you might want to and then you're in the next room.

1349
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,400
And keep in mind, if you're prone to this or that, you could go.

1350
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,600
You know, hey, look, don't

1351
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,360
no shame on my part.

1352
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,360
If you want to keep walking out that door, be the flight director.

1353
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,320
I'm not going to tell. I'm not going to tell anybody.

1354
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,240
There aren't a lot of rides that try to talk you out of the ride.

1355
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,920
I think the moments the door will the door in front of you will open.

1356
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,040
Keep walking through it and then out the next door and don't do the ride.

1357
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,080
Seriously, don't do the right.

1358
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,000
Like, tell your family that you did it and they're not say

1359
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,320
you got a little woozy and that's it.

1360
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,720
It's a clean alibi. Don't go on the ride.

1361
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,440
So here's part of the plan.

1362
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,960
We get in a gantry lift unless you don't want to.

1363
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,720
If you don't want to get in the lift, don't worry about it

1364
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,920
because it goes up and down pretty fast.

1365
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,800
Don't worry. You're not a chicken.

1366
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,320
I still respect you and you're a big part of the plan.

1367
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,560
You'll be waiting for your friends after.

1368
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,600
But if you do want to go, we're going up and down.

1369
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,800
We see the monsters. The scary.

1370
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,520
If you don't like that, leave now again.

1371
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,400
I will not be upset.

1372
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,280
Maybe just go outside. There's a little cart.

1373
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,040
They got big cream puffs.

1374
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,600
You can just get a cream puff.

1375
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,120
Don't even worry about it.

1376
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,320
We play the songs out in the gift shop.

1377
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,400
You can hear them. It's not you're missing nothing.

1378
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,720
You're missing nothing by the ride. Not going on.

1379
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,040
Just put them on a playlist and hop up and down.

1380
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,800
That's plenty. Yeah.

1381
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,160
Same shit doesn't matter.

1382
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,360
No one's going to be a big baby.

1383
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,800
Open the Disney Play app.

1384
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,000
Then you get to go on an adventure where you try to figure out

1385
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,960
how to regain the battery life to your phone and just exactly

1386
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,080
why it is so very hot now.

1387
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
Your phone gets hot. It's exciting.

1388
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,640
That's odd. It's not usually that hot.

1389
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,040
So it's just the same as going to the dumb ride anyway. Yeah.

1390
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,320
Why are you still here? Get the fuck out.

1391
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,520
It's scary. Don't do it.

1392
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,120
You think I want to do it?

1393
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,080
If I wasn't fake, I would leave.

1394
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,960
Scott, I did like right before rewatch this again,

1395
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,200
and it is shocking how much they say

1396
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,280
this is orange version, the more intense version,

1397
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,720
or this is green version, the less intense version, which

1398
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,880
I had too many things I wanted to do down in Florida.

1399
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,520
It didn't dawn on me like, oh, I should have gone through again

1400
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,160
and done green version. Yeah.

1401
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,600
Should you let down it?

1402
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,160
It's weird that like it's not just that it's a less intense

1403
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,480
trip to Mars. You don't even get to go to Mars. Right.

1404
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,480
Why not just still like, isn't it kind of insulting that like,

1405
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,080
OK, you chose mission WIMP.

1406
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,560
So that means you leave Florida and fly back to Florida.

1407
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,600
You chose Google Earth View,

1408
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,760
something you've been able to do on a desktop computer since 2004 or 2005.

1409
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,680
Yeah, it they both share that the

1410
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,280
they miss the run or they go too far off the end of the runway.

1411
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,160
Either almost go off a cliff or they knock over a fence,

1412
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,600
which they should figure out.

1413
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,760
They didn't figure out the runway situation, huh?

1414
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,800
But they made the new the new version of the ride.

1415
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,880
Still a lot of runway issues.

1416
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,320
Still a lot of there is a runway, which Aaron, not knowing it at all, was like,

1417
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,240
what do you mean a runway?

1418
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,920
And I said, no, it's not it's it's not the first mission to Mars.

1419
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,000
Like people have been there.

1420
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,200
They've like laid down infrastructure.

1421
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,480
They paved.

1422
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,560
What do you get?

1423
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,160
So I'm the the one hundred and twelve flight to Mars.

1424
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,720
It gives a shit.

1425
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,040
These aren't stakes.

1426
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,560
I want wild wilderness.

1427
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,680
I want to hit giant boulders.

1428
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,560
Yeah, there's like a Macy's on the Mars at this point.

1429
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,480
It's like there's been we've settled it.

1430
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,520
It's like who gives a shit.

1431
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,400
You're just going on a routine trip into space.

1432
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,000
You're you're dropping off a load of Ben Sherman polo shirts.

1433
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,040
We're filling the Macy's stock of Ben Sherman.

1434
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,680
The Martians are wearing polo shirts.

1435
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,200
You know, don't hit the Peloton studio.

1436
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,320
Yeah, you're restocking the Mars gift shop.

1437
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:34,640
By the way, I just right before we started recording, literally minutes before,

1438
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,360
I found a link to an article about how the the

1439
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,840
base at Guantanamo Bay has a gift shop

1440
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,200
full of Guantanamo Bay merch.

1441
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,200
What?

1442
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:54,280
I mean, for like like there's like a straight out of Guantanamo

1443
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,240
shirts for the people that I'm guessing are the people that are released or for what?

1444
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,240
Uh huh.

1445
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:04,160
For the employees, for the service members and their family.

1446
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,840
Yes, straight out straight out of Gitmo.

1447
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,440
This isn't a bit.

1448
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,480
There's a be here now.

1449
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,600
Guantanamo Bay coffee mug.

1450
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,600
Be here now.

1451
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,520
Like it's a mindfulness that be period here, period now.

1452
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,440
Wow, you're right.

1453
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,800
I'd rather be there now than a couple of years ago.

1454
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,240
They have a plush dinosaur that says, Guantanamo Bay on it.

1455
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,240
What?

1456
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,440
No.

1457
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
What?

1458
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,320
This article is three years old.

1459
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,520
And that was the biggest revelation that this has not come across my eyes before.

1460
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,680
What the hell?

1461
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:45,200
The COVID era has been very tough on the gift shop at Guantanamo Bay.

1462
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,360
We're not sure if it's going to recover.

1463
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,040
The merch at Guantanamo Bay is better than that at Universal Studios.

1464
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,840
Straight out of Gitmo.

1465
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
What the hell?

1466
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,000
Oh my God, a Guantanamo Bay lizard.

1467
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,640
This is fucking perverse.

1468
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,200
Jesus.

1469
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,000
This is insane.

1470
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
God damn it.

1471
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,960
We're going to doing an episode about this is going to suck.

1472
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,080
We're going to do the Guantanamo Bay episode.

1473
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,080
But the tone the entire time is like, oh, this.

1474
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,880
Why do we have to?

1475
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah, because it's like you don't have to.

1476
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Why are you doing it?

1477
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
We do.

1478
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
We have a podcast.

1479
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
We have to do it.

1480
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,320
There's a McDonald's.

1481
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,640
Everyone, but every there's multiple times we've been like, well, the flag at the Gitmo

1482
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,160
McDonald's is that half mast again.

1483
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,440
Oh my God. Can you mobile order from the Gitmo McDonald's?

1484
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,040
Can you do can you use one of the dollar coffee deals?

1485
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,360
That's a good question.

1486
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,360
Let me see.

1487
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,880
Siri.

1488
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,240
What stage of of covid cabin fever is it that you're mobile ordering

1489
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,040
from the Gitmo McDonald's?

1490
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,480
I bet you I bet you I bet it's like an airport McDonald's, although sometimes

1491
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,240
you can mobile order in an airport McDonald's.

1492
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,240
I have done it.

1493
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,240
You can.

1494
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:09,480
I think Jason planted all of this to ensure that it didn't seem like

1495
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,240
Mission Space is the worst tourist attraction in the world.

1496
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,520
You know, I never got to go to space camp.

1497
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,840
I always saw it as like the prize on the Nickelodeon.

1498
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,040
Well, yeah, I didn't.

1499
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Yeah, I chose.

1500
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,520
So I guess this is kind of a little taste of it.

1501
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,800
There's a little play area when you get off and a gift shop, you know,

1502
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:36,520
I never seen terribly exciting any of that stuff.

1503
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,920
Probably not.

1504
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,200
You know what's really crazy in this ride?

1505
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,800
If we if we're jumping around, if we want to just talk about the ride that you

1506
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:50,800
again, the idea you have to like whip around the moon, use the orbit of the moon

1507
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,640
to whip you in the right direction.

1508
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,360
And then it's like, OK, night night.

1509
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,760
Like they put you to hyper sleep and then the the glass fogs up and it's kind of

1510
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,800
it's sort of icy for a second and then just all of a sudden.

1511
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,000
Get up, wake up. You got stuff to do.

1512
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,880
It's so crazy.

1513
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,640
It's so jar like they do.

1514
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:18,680
They do produce like a much more jarring way of waking up than probably any of us.

1515
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,560
That's but that might be number one most unpleasant.

1516
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,960
Like what if there was a ride where a loud alarm told you to that woke you up

1517
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,720
from a three month sleep?

1518
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,120
Who, Jason, that's for you.

1519
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,520
That's a strike against this ride, don't you think?

1520
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,480
Well, that it's it's a noisy wake up.

1521
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1522
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,880
The end of it. You get to experience the end of a long nap,

1523
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,400
a jarring end of a long nap. Yeah.

1524
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,960
Yeah. That's the worst part.

1525
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,560
You know, I I I like that they don't belabor it too much.

1526
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:54,240
The hyper sleep like like it's really is it like interstellar or one of the where

1527
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,040
it's like always sad when everyone's coming out of the sleep?

1528
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,040
You know, I'm trying to think of like an alien when they come out of the sleep

1529
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,040
in the first alien.

1530
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,960
It's very gentle. Yeah, it's very.

1531
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,920
Yeah, they're really taking their time.

1532
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,520
You got to adjust. But no, these people, these monsters of the

1533
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,760
whatever un catchy acronym they are, you P R T.

1534
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,880
I don't know what the I see.

1535
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,920
See, yes, I don't know what the this is.

1536
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,760
Nobody likes that.

1537
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,000
Nobody wants like shirts of this, of no of the not NASA that they made.

1538
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,080
It's less fun.

1539
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,240
Like everything they wanted to make it so realistic.

1540
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,640
Nothing's fun.

1541
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,760
Graphics, not good.

1542
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:35,840
The graphics got better.

1543
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,240
But boy, those graphics like it's it's real flat.

1544
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:45,360
And then this has a weird moment like the the Millennium Falcon,

1545
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,400
that that Millennium Falcon stall thing where it's like, wait a minute,

1546
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,120
there's a disturbance. Yes, right.

1547
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,000
Was not anything.

1548
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,680
You can go by this.

1549
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,040
This is the only get that once in a while in this ride.

1550
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,000
It's caked in that like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1551
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,760
You're looking over a chasm.

1552
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,120
Lean back. OK.

1553
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,800
You lean back successfully.

1554
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,760
You're free to go by.

1555
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,160
Like it doesn't start a more exciting chapter of the ride.

1556
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,600
That's like a trope in movies like you're at the edge of a cliff.

1557
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,480
No one move.

1558
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,880
Inevitably, someone's going to move.

1559
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,400
I feel like I. Oh, what is that movie?

1560
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,040
I watched it a few weeks ago.

1561
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,760
Is it the Lost City?

1562
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,720
The Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock one.

1563
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,280
There's like a moment where it's like, don't don't don't follow.

1564
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,320
The car fell over the cliff.

1565
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,320
Oh, I was.

1566
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,120
It's either the person has gotten out of it and you didn't see them get out,

1567
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,600
or they go for a ride and they tumble down the cliff.

1568
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,040
You know, right. But not on this ride.

1569
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,440
I'm assuming they're telling you, because if you tried to get out of the car,

1570
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,640
the compartment would need to move towards the cliff

1571
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,760
a little to reset to get you out. Right.

1572
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,760
Oh, yeah. We're all going to die when we open the hatch.

1573
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,080
Yeah. So you're being towed by a mater or something. Yeah.

1574
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,600
Like a bad fun.

1575
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,880
But there was no mater then. There is now.

1576
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,120
Well, that's the plus up. Get mater in there.

1577
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,360
Yeah. Well, sure. Please.

1578
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,640
Mater on everything.

1579
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,840
Or even you know what?

1580
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,720
Really, the plus up.

1581
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,960
I don't know if you want to jump right to that already.

1582
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,680
The plus up is like Disney's capsules

1583
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,120
and it's like planes and cars.

1584
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,160
And yeah, they've all got tongues.

1585
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,040
They've all got tongues. They talk.

1586
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,640
So, yeah, when you're hearing like instruction, it's from the actual ship

1587
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,960
itself that's yelling at you.

1588
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,160
But like, it's fun. He's got a fun voice or it's like

1589
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,520
it's Sebastian Madaskalco or something is the voice of the capsule.

1590
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,920
And he's yelling at you.

1591
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,080
So hit the button or whatever.

1592
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,080
Don't hit that one.

1593
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,240
Wake up, wake up.

1594
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,480
No one wants to work anymore.

1595
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,920
Party let you sleep in for three months.

1596
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:02,600
It's they throw some water on your face and get back to work.

1597
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,200
You ever go to Chipotle and they're giving you the beans.

1598
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,520
Oh, no, no, no. Let me correct you.

1599
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,000
It is Chipotle.

1600
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,360
Right. You go to Chipotle.

1601
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,560
And you're looking at this these kind of Chipotle.

1602
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,600
Yeah, that that is much more accurate. Yes.

1603
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,280
So crucial part of the bit that it is Chipotle.

1604
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,080
What do you think you'd have a little Chipotle

1605
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,240
and then you go to sleep for three months?

1606
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,880
I love much better.

1607
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,160
I love being mad at a restaurant that literally walks you down the line

1608
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,320
of how to get your food.

1609
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,720
It's the best bit, because if you never watched the semester

1610
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,320
Maniscalco Chipotle, Chipotle bit

1611
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,280
where he's he all the premises are wrong.

1612
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,960
It's like, you got the people reaching around.

1613
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,400
They're going up all over the glass.

1614
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,760
And you know, I have never seen that.

1615
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,760
This has never happened to me in Chipotle.

1616
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,880
He is making a he is like is like every like that.

1617
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,800
Put the cheese in the rub and do the cheese.

1618
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,080
He's like making motions with his hands and everyone's like dying.

1619
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,280
You're like, I've never seen this before.

1620
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,120
I've never heard. What experience are you describing?

1621
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,080
They're scooping the beans with the big bean shovel.

1622
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,320
No, I've never seen that they don't have a bean shovel.

1623
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,080
But it's under all the actions are funny.

1624
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,320
That's the thing.

1625
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,840
Right. We're the only killjoys who aren't having fun.

1626
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,680
If we would just embrace the silly movements, the silly man is doing.

1627
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:41,840
He's making silly movements as if really all that's registering to people

1628
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,680
watching it are like it would be funny if somebody was acting this silly

1629
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,040
because I've been in that line before.

1630
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,440
So I can imagine this.

1631
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,480
And we're like, no, that's not it.

1632
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,360
That's not the authentic experience.

1633
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,400
Go to a chip chipotle.

1634
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,960
It's I can't even go backwards and say it the right way.

1635
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,680
Go to a chip chipotle.

1636
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,640
It is business as usual most of the time.

1637
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,440
Sebastian, I take umbrage with your premise.

1638
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:09,240
I think the bigger unusual thing is all that listeria

1639
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,680
they were cooking up back in the day.

1640
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,520
All that food poisoning.

1641
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,280
Mission to Mars, that's safer than going to my mom's kitchen.

1642
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,080
It gets all scolded by the sauce.

1643
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,040
He's the cat voice of the capsule.

1644
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,200
He'd be a great, you know, in the way it's a perfect equivalent

1645
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,320
of where I don't like Larry the Cable Guy's comedy,

1646
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,800
but I do enjoy him in cars.

1647
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,600
And it's a I bet I would love a Sebastian Maniscalco

1648
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,200
leading voice in some movie.

1649
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,800
Yes, he's got a great cartoon voice, as does Larry.

1650
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,120
Yeah, he's he's a good quick appearance is crazy.

1651
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,360
Joey Gallo in The Irishman.

1652
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

1653
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,840
Yeah. Why doesn't do isn't Disney take an advantage of it?

1654
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,360
Well, yeah, I agree. That's the fix.

1655
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,840
We got it. You make it capsules.

1656
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,480
Disney's capsules done as long as.

1657
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,480
But you know, remember, and another thing that's boring about this ride

1658
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,200
is that you walk into this room and it's just this training facility.

1659
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,520
Right. And you just it's so industrial when you walk in there

1660
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,480
because it is just undressed capsules, essentially.

1661
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:23,160
In this version, they would have to show us what that capsule looks like

1662
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,880
and maybe show the capsule sucking down a big pile of spaghetti.

1663
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,360
Need fuel for the ride.

1664
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,440
They should show when you're in the capsule and you see in the little screen,

1665
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,000
they should cut from that little screen to like an outside camera, too.

1666
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,000
So like you can see he's got like a big bib on ready to eat

1667
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,040
the spaghetti or something.

1668
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,080
Once he has face getting sucked back. Yeah.

1669
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,200
This is like five thousand hairdryers.

1670
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,760
Yeah, you think the the fuel you think the liquid nitrogen

1671
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,240
in this capsule is intense.

1672
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,400
You got to try my mom's famous sauce.

1673
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,360
It'll melt your face off the gravy.

1674
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,640
This would triple the wait times for this ride.

1675
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,000
People would still come out feeling very ill,

1676
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,600
but they would be so entertained. So it wouldn't matter. Yeah. Yeah.

1677
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,120
And everyone would just call it.

1678
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,400
It would just be like, have you done the chipotle ride yet?

1679
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,320
No one calls it the right thing.

1680
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,000
But it's a poll at the end of the ride.

1681
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,640
Like this is a good this is a very synergistic.

1682
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,800
What is the chip?

1683
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,040
Did he say something about synergy recently?

1684
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,320
I would imagine he says something about synergy many times every day.

1685
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:43,200
Yeah. Put your yields, the yields, the results of the yields

1686
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,440
are going to be through the roof.

1687
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,480
Oh, the results of the they were this is an opposite compact

1688
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,640
HP Carly Fiorina.

1689
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,920
We're going exactly the other way. Yeah.

1690
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,560
Straight to the stratosphere.

1691
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,360
We're unfavorable.

1692
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,760
We're unfavorables. We're three of the unfavorable.

1693
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,360
We're unfavorable.

1694
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,440
I do it. I forget someone posted that

1695
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,960
a website that makes like signs or T-shirts and magnets and stuff

1696
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:12,280
made the magic band like sticker or the key holder sticker

1697
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,560
that you got. And it said like unfavorable attendance on it.

1698
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,960
Wow. Wow. Oh, that's pretty good.

1699
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:24,120
My plus up was going to be that if you were feeling like you are two point

1700
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:28,760
five times your weight, your body weight, you're being pushed backwards.

1701
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,400
They should make the visuals match the feeling

1702
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,200
and they should have the multicolor 2001

1703
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,520
kaleidoscope effect going on the screen.

1704
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:45,520
You should, you know, enter a new stage of being like Dave does

1705
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,920
when he crosses something that would.

1706
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,880
Well, while a cool idea, I feel like that might completely mess you up.

1707
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,920
Yeah, man.

1708
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:58,640
Really make you throw up to go on a psychedelic

1709
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:04,600
like carnival pinwheel style like the path to death.

1710
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,400
Do it. Make it the Halloween version.

1711
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,720
Make it like Halloween plus the Wonka Eve, like the scary Wonka River,

1712
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,160
like with the like psychedelic images.

1713
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,480
I mean, that's a good idea.

1714
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,360
That's a good ride in general. Yeah. How does that ever happened?

1715
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,600
Just because it would like make people vomit in terror.

1716
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,600
Yeah. I mean, they're even talking about Wonka Rides Forever.

1717
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,000
But that's obviously the ride is on the river.

1718
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,120
The chocolate, the gross chocolate river.

1719
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,920
Maintaining the chocolate river would would really be something. Yeah.

1720
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,640
OK, so Jason wants it psychedelic.

1721
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,200
Mike wants it with a living

1722
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,800
fun Italian capsule.

1723
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,120
I think we presented some really excellent ideas.

1724
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,280
It's just making it less dry because I think maybe the effect

1725
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,200
is interesting and worth upholding.

1726
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,040
But the presentation is just I don't know.

1727
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,240
That's its downfall. I think it's just it's just not fun.

1728
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,200
I will say, though, because we the old scale where it was like

1729
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,120
he says is plus up or burn it down.

1730
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,560
I'll say burn it down.

1731
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,280
I think it's still burn it down.

1732
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,880
I think take it to take this freaking thing down.

1733
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,520
I don't care. I don't want to plus it up.

1734
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,720
Take this freaking thing flushes down the toilet like a bunch like yesterday's

1735
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,240
chipotle. Yeah. Yeah.

1736
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,000
Well, I agree. I don't know, Jason, where'd you land?

1737
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,440
Did we did we slide you either way?

1738
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,320
I don't I I feel like I overall

1739
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,520
there's not as many nasty little freaks like me.

1740
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,440
I feel like more guests are getting ill or having a bad time on this experience.

1741
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,960
So I may say burn it down and start fresh, if only because

1742
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,840
I feel like the ride technology has come so far.

1743
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,800
You could do like half as many G's and have a more

1744
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,480
pleasant experience and also a more whimsical like

1745
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,320
horizons, more future looking interesting ride.

1746
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,400
Because the other thing is big downgrade in terms of like animatronics,

1747
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,560
like a lot of screens, no animatronics on this guy.

1748
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1749
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,720
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah.

1750
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,560
Burn it down and build Flip Flap Railway Mach 2.

1751
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,480
Get it up to 24 G's.

1752
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:31,600
It stopped too short. It only broke one part of your body.

1753
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,440
You should end it. You should like it.

1754
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:37,120
You should. It should be a full reset of all of your bones.

1755
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,880
Yeah. Yeah. Look, slapping Kano on it.

1756
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,440
You know, that's big hit.

1757
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:45,520
We don't we don't we don't talk about Flip Flap Railway.

1758
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,760
You know, the Kanto presents Flip Flap Railway.

1759
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,960
They're done. Perfect.

1760
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,560
The big the big panda get tumbles out of Flip Flap Railway.

1761
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,680
He comes out of your car and then goes at the loop.

1762
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,880
It comes back in your car.

1763
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:59,920
That's always funny. Right, dudes.

1764
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,280
From. Yeah. Turning red. What did I say?

1765
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,560
I don't know. I don't know if you said turning red railway.

1766
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,520
I don't think it's a turning red.

1767
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,440
It's a big red.

1768
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,960
Isn't it a big like a red panda?

1769
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,760
They're different than the other.

1770
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,720
It is a red. I guess you're right. Yeah.

1771
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,840
Clearly lots of better things you could do with this land.

1772
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,360
And I think we got it.

1773
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,760
I I'm going to say you survived podcast The Ride.

1774
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,200
But I feels like on the way out, Mike, what are you heading?

1775
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,480
Do you want to?

1776
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,840
Do we have the same clip here?

1777
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,880
Does it involve a real astronaut?

1778
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,240
It sure does. It does. Hang on.

1779
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,280
Well, let's get there.

1780
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,320
But let me let me say here on the way out,

1781
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,160
because this is a good way to to to play it out.

1782
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,320
OK, it's been crazy.

1783
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,080
Jason got covid bunch of stuffs going on.

1784
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,360
It's been a nuts time for us.

1785
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:49,080
So we are going to take a much needed summer vacation.

1786
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:54,280
We're taking the next two weeks off on the main feed, including Labor Day weekend.

1787
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:57,840
But if you don't want the good boy fun to stop,

1788
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,880
if you want your favorite national daddies to keep flipping and flapping,

1789
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:08,720
then there's going to be new stuff up on podcast The Ride, The Second Gate

1790
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:13,960
and our new tier club three for a fun episode about Disney dollars coming up.

1791
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,680
And you will find all of that at patreon.com slash podcast The Ride.

1792
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,600
So apologies for our absence here, but we'll re-release something.

1793
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,760
We'll unlock something and we'll be back

1794
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,240
refreshed and raring to go.

1795
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,360
But super fun stuff happening over in the paywall city.

1796
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,880
So, Mike, what you're describing,

1797
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:38,680
is this a sketch from the magical world of Disney or whatever you call it?

1798
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,280
Starring Jerry O'Connell. Yes.

1799
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,520
Jason, have you seen this?

1800
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,520
No.

1801
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,400
Well, not only Jerry O'Connell, but there's more

1802
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,000
fun cameos to come.

1803
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,360
So, you know, he's promoting mission space

1804
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,840
and he's being assigned his flight crew.

1805
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,960
As our crew, the success of this mission depends entirely upon you.

1806
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,600
Ma'am, you're our commander.

1807
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,680
Son, you're our engineer.

1808
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,000
Sir, Colonel Buzz Aldrin, sir.

1809
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,000
You're kind enough to be our pilot.

1810
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,720
Colonel Buzz Aldrin, he really walked on the moon.

1811
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,120
And you're our navigator.

1812
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,240
I don't have any navigator experience.

1813
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,680
Navigator, I don't even know how to read the compass.

1814
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,920
Buzz, you got my back?

1815
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,320
Yeah, I'm with him.

1816
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,560
That's great. Then they throw it a commercial.

1817
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,520
That's kind of all he does.

1818
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,480
And then there's one little one more little appearance.

1819
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,160
So, yes, Mike, when you alluded to this, I'm glad you found this too.

1820
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,120
Buzz Aldrin delighted by Buzz.

1821
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,040
So happy to see him.

1822
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,720
I was going to ask, do you kind of like me, do you kind of equate

1823
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,960
Buzz Aldrin and Ringo in any way?

1824
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,200
Where they both like did incredibly impressive things,

1825
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,880
but they're kind of these like funny little guys now.

1826
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,360
Like they're similar, they're really similar to me.

1827
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,680
I know what you're saying.

1828
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,120
Buzz Aldrin feels like this is I don't want to insult this guy.

1829
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,000
He feels like he'll do anything.

1830
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,480
He feels like you like you go, hey, you want to show up at this?

1831
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,320
And he goes, yeah, right.

1832
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,960
Which honestly, like, hey, you should go.

1833
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,840
He did. He walked on the moon.

1834
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,840
God bless. I I.

1835
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,920
OK, I might not be remembering this correctly,

1836
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,760
but there was a funny or die event.

1837
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,720
Yes. Yes. This is where you were.

1838
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,840
I'm thinking, yes, I was there, too. Yes.

1839
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,240
OK. Yeah, it was at the Egyptian Theater,

1840
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,840
historic theater on Hollywood Boulevard,

1841
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,440
and they were screening a bunch of videos from that year.

1842
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,440
And there were some live comedy, too.

1843
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:46,920
And I believe was it he got on stage with Zach Galifianakis and Sarah Silverman?

1844
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,680
Something like that. Yeah.

1845
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,040
I mean, which is like fun.

1846
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,480
Like, I don't I should I guess really what I was like, I was like,

1847
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,200
Buzz Aldrin's at this dumb event with us.

1848
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:00,080
Yes, we don't deserve access to this man, to the second man on the moon.

1849
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:00,920
That's what I kind of.

1850
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,640
Full right around goofing around.

1851
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,680
Yeah, he was a pretty good sport.

1852
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:10,080
I believe it was it alive between two ferns with the three of them.

1853
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:13,000
Oh, maybe. Oh, that's fine.

1854
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,640
You know, you did the lead in.

1855
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,360
So, you know, forget the end of this.

1856
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:19,880
He just kind of says like, hey, I'm going to get back on it again.

1857
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,160
And I don't know.

1858
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,240
I don't know.

1859
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,960
Wait, did you have a part you wanted to?

1860
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,880
Yeah, I thought, look, it's not the great.

1861
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:26,960
I mean, that's the gist of it.

1862
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,800
But there's they're like, did you see when they're working together?

1863
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,200
Uh, let me play it.

1864
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:32,880
Do you think it's this?

1865
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,840
I think it might just be this. I think, yeah.

1866
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,920
We're not going to make it activating boosters.

1867
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,960
Five thrusters now.

1868
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,680
I can't find it. I can't find the button.

1869
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:40,640
Yeah, I got it.

1870
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,640
Yeah, I got it.

1871
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,080
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

1872
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,200
Yeah, they're not on the ride.

1873
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,040
Like they're just like probably making the ride going.

1874
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,880
They got buzz. I got a great line reading there.

1875
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,640
Yeah, I got it. Yeah, yeah.

1876
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:55,040
That's really all I wanted to play.

1877
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,400
Oh, it's so great.

1878
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,960
Well, then let me go into because.

1879
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,440
OK, I've talked before about how much I love this crazy performance he did

1880
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,880
with Thomas Dolby of you.

1881
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,400
She blinded me with science where he's the old man who yells science.

1882
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,560
But one time he messes up and says, silence.

1883
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,040
And I'm very glad people have noticed this and enjoyed this.

1884
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,600
And look up the clip if you haven't seen it.

1885
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,600
But I was like, do I have to bring this up on the show?

1886
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,440
I think I have to.

1887
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,560
And it is his main funny or die collaboration.

1888
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,840
I may have talked about this before,

1889
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,000
but have I ever played it? I don't think I've played it.

1890
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,800
And do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1891
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,200
I think I do.

1892
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,280
So right before I got to funny or die, this was like this looms large.

1893
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,120
So I was like, where what am I heading into?

1894
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,840
What's this dream factory making?

1895
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:46,600
And what they were making was a Buzz Aldrin song called Buzz Aldrin's

1896
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,240
Rocket Experience.

1897
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:53,000
And now I'm I know that this is like novelty.

1898
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,760
I know that he is not trying to top the rap charts.

1899
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:01,320
However, so I'm just going to say that that I am aware that there's a level of camp here.

1900
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,920
And it's great. Look, this makes me so happy.

1901
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,480
I just want to share it with you guys and with the audience.

1902
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,360
So maybe this will this will kind of take us out.

1903
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:16,320
And for a little bit, this will guide us into a little summer vacation.

1904
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,960
Our own little bit of hyper sleep.

1905
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,480
Precisely.

1906
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,600
OK, so here now a little taste of Buzz Aldrin's

1907
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,000
Rocket Experience.

1908
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,480
The most like Broadway trio back in the month.

1909
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,920
And what?

1910
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,720
Your singers.

1911
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:05,320
Are you ready to put on your space suit strapped in for the G Force lift?

1912
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:11,200
Oh, count down is getting very close now to the adventure of a lifetime.

1913
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,840
I've been there now, I say it's your turn.

1914
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:18,640
All we got to do is make the engine burn.

1915
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,240
This is how you save the ride.

1916
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,600
They should just play this.

1917
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,280
Just put this on.

1918
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,200
Are you ready?

1919
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,400
You chose a mission orange now.

1920
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,280
Don't forget, it's a little more intense now.

1921
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,840
Don't even show us the video of seeing Mars or anything.

1922
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,720
You show the video this.

1923
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,720
It's just play. Yeah.

1924
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,480
If you can't reach the button, the computer does it for you.

1925
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:50,960
Remember not to pile it, but don't look left or right now.

1926
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,520
Or else you get sick and your face will turn white now.

1927
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,360
Though that's it.

1928
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,800
We're all right. We have so many souls.

1929
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,000
Just do one of them. For God's sake, Disney.

1930
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,640
You don't need Carly Fiorina's permission anymore.

1931
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,400
Put the Buzz Aldrin music video in the ride.

1932
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,280
Damn it. That's it.

1933
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,400
We're out. We're out for two weeks.

1934
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,400
Bye. Bye.
