1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,340
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,900
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,620
McGrew, the mobile gripes response unit.

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,880
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always,

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,220
McGrew member Scott Gerdner.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,080
Yeah, wait, is that an acronym?

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,200
What is McGrew?

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,940
Yes, it's M-G-R-U, mobile gripes response unit.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,360
Okay, okay, that is the, all right, mobile, all right.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,060
Yeah, I mean, we're not so mobile, we're wired up,

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,120
but we could be, just couldn't record.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,140
Yes, I thought about making a but

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,260
to make it sound more like McGruff.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,120
I wanted to put M and I needed an M there.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,480
So that's why the M-

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,340
We're technically mobile, I'm in a rolling chair.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,000
So yes, I'm playing mobile.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,340
I'm recording in a different room than normal.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,180
So I feel like there's some mobility as well.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,680
And we can still, we can record anywhere we've recorded,

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,240
in an empty sports chalet or whatever in the valley before.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,160
So we are somewhat mobile.

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,860
Jason Sheridan also part of the team here, are you ready?

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,740
I'm ready, yeah, I'm ready now.

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,480
You disappointed me with the first answer.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,040
Now I'm with you.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,500
Well, when we first, these gripes first started coming in,

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,980
I was, I feel like we've all had our ups and downs

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,500
in quarantine, but I feel, right around,

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,700
when we first asked for these,

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,840
my mental state was very emotional,

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,480
like overcome by any slight friction.

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,660
It takes everything very personally.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,920
So I read about five and I was like,

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,260
I don't know if I can do this episode.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,640
And now I kind of get it a little more,

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,580
cause I found some good conversation starter.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,140
Well, yes, when we called or when we were talking

39
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,380
about this, I think I told the audience, I said,

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,260
maybe don't make them so mean.

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,340
Not everyone listened to that.

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,580
A few people decided-

43
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,460
For the most part.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,540
For the most part.

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,080
Mostly people, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,140
But I'm saying there were a few in there where you're like,

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,240
I don't know, this seems kind of mean.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,720
I don't know.

49
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,460
Maybe you didn't hear me say, no, don't be mean.

50
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,460
But you open yourself up to that.

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
And I guess you can't be picky with, I mean,

52
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,640
I think we'll show, Mike put this great,

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,580
use the phrase, there were people

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,140
who understood the assignment.

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,680
There are certain ones that really understood

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,160
the assignment and there's other ones that are just like,

57
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,380
well, here's my chance to kind of cut them

58
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,980
in the chest a little bit.

59
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,180
Which you know what?

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,140
I love your podcast, you dickheads.

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,020
Fair enough, you know, anonymity,

62
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,880
you grab people anonymity on the internet

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,460
and that's gonna happen.

64
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,180
It was-

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,360
I know, we asked, we called for this.

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,220
It's amazing it wasn't worse in a way.

67
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:03,900
Yeah.

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,960
It is true, it is true.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,420
It could have been much worse.

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
We have lovely fans, but it was very funny,

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
like half a day later when Mike was like,

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm sorry I suggested this in the group text.

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,860
There was a minute, yes.

74
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, there was a minute where it was looking bad.

75
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,460
There were a couple in there where I went,

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,600
I don't need to hear this today.

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,940
Yeah.

78
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,220
We got almost 300 responses.

79
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,780
Wow.

80
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,340
Some of them were duplicates.

81
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,960
Amazing.

82
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,800
Because Google apps like any cloud-based apps

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
are kind of a pain in the ass.

84
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,020
So thank you for navigating those.

85
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,300
You know what it is nice, it is nice.

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,540
I do, I do, I may be not nice to work,

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,520
but it is interesting to see exactly, you know,

88
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,480
what people's thoughts are.

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,660
And I will just, this is a quick one.

90
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,520
And maybe you guys have this

91
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,720
and I'm ruining what you're gonna say,

92
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,520
but this is sort of indicative of some of,

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
of what we were looking through here

94
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,800
is that somebody said to us, they had a gripe

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
that the term seat has gotten out of hand

96
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,980
and kind of isn't funny anymore.

97
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,980
Okay, somebody said that.

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,040
All right, that's fair.

99
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,080
You know, I'm sure there's-

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,660
I mean, I agreed, you know, a year and a half ago.

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,420
I was on board with this gripe.

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,880
Right, now, if you go down, I believe four gripes,

103
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,320
somebody commented,

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,700
there hasn't been a thick seat final four yet.

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
So what are we gonna do with this, folks?

106
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,760
Everyone's all over the place.

107
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,420
I thought the same thing.

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
I have another example of the duality of the gripes,

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
which is that the very first one

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
that wasn't just us testing the system,

111
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,720
the very first one was remove Bugsy.

112
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,640
And then about 10 later, just several hours later,

113
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Bugsy is criminally underused.

114
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,020
So there's really no degree of it.

115
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,940
It takes all kinds.

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,080
Yeah, there's no consensus.

117
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,040
It's all about balance, you know?

118
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,080
Podcasting, like many things, all about balance.

119
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,420
Cause we, you know, there was one or two that was like,

120
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,720
hey, you have to explain what the George Clooney briefcase

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,220
is a money mean to new listeners.

122
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,040
You have to explain what Terra Monic tequila is,

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,760
like what the rocks tequila's significance is.

124
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,360
But on the other hand, you know,

125
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,700
you are rewarded if you stick with a show for a long time

126
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,160
by running jokes and some people don't wanna hear

127
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,300
the explanations over and over.

128
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
So I think we try to tread that line.

129
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,020
We try to be cognizant.

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,940
Sure, of course.

131
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,580
I will say gripes inspired by a Funny or Die video,

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,780
the term.

133
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,660
Oh, you mean King of Gripes with Nick Carpacioso?

134
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,040
That's correct, yes.

135
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,640
I was looking for it and I couldn't remember,

136
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,480
Scott, do you have something to do with this video?

137
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,140
I do not, but it's my friend and collaborator,

138
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,600
Nick Carassi, who bears a resemblance to people

139
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,380
who've appeared on the show

140
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,860
and have been mentioned in this episode.

141
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,020
No, I'm not part of that.

142
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,480
It seems like kind of a cousin of our ClipCup franchise,

143
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,440
but it is actually, we noticed that it was not available

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,700
online and we did track it down recently.

145
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,960
And you know what, there has been a private link

146
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,120
for a while on viewboo.

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,760
com.

148
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,240
So maybe I'll just make that public on viewboo,

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,040
which is a great streaming site

150
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,760
that we might also have something to do with.

151
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,500
Yeah, that's kind of his sort of Dennis Leary-esque.

152
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,080
Yeah, I got a gripe.

153
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,760
Hey, don't tell me not to eat red meat, okay?

154
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,020
Look, I want a cigarette.

155
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,300
I want it absolutely bloody.

156
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,740
I want it beet red, okay?

157
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,460
And I don't want PC police coming down on me, gripe.

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
So yeah, check out gripes, the video.

159
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Yeah, we'll find a way to get that out there.

160
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,640
Maybe you share some of those gripes.

161
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,920
That's funny that inspired that term.

162
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,400
We should probably remind people also

163
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,180
of what happened here exactly,

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,760
which is at the beginning of the year

165
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,740
that we put out a very first episode of the year,

166
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,220
we put out a call for your gripes.

167
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,380
We put up a Google forms link,

168
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,720
which is still available and we'll repost it,

169
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,680
assuming that by the end of this,

170
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,740
we don't wanna erase it forever

171
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,540
and make sure there's no gripes anymore.

172
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,380
But we made it an anonymous feedback box.

173
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,380
Now we've had, look, we've done mailbag episodes.

174
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,240
We've said, we'll reply to this tweet

175
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,560
and ask us some questions and stuff,

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,480
but this is kind of a different way to go with the anonymity.

177
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,100
And I think an interesting experiment,

178
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,160
which some people just said their names anyway,

179
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,740
and I appreciate that.

180
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,540
They're like, I'll put my name next to anything

181
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,780
that any thought that I have.

182
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,520
There's also, you guys probably noticed

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,460
that there were some gripes that were about the notion

184
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,360
of doing the anonymous gripes,

185
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,660
including this one that I enjoyed, which is,

186
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,340
oh, I forgot also, I tried to mentally prioritize

187
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,920
any gripes that followed the requested pattern

188
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,700
of saying at the beginning, yeah, I got a gripe all right.

189
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,220
And this one followed that.

190
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,020
So here we go.

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,700
Yeah, I got a gripe all right.

192
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,220
You wanna solicit comments from your listeners

193
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,760
and use them in future shows?

194
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,340
Isn't that how snakes on a plane happened?

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,740
Ha ha ha ha.

196
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,460
Very good, very good point.

197
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,160
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
That's a reference, I guess, to the fact that

199
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,060
people were upset that there weren't,

200
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,840
wasn't more swearing in snakes on a plane.

201
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,360
I forget that.

202
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
Oh, it was just that it was like

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
people's idea of the movie didn't match.

204
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,060
They made like a pretty boring movie, I think,

205
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,660
and what everyone was imagining was a crazy movie

206
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,580
where snakes bite people in the dick,

207
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,320
and Samuel L.

208
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,840
Jackson says,

209
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,200
I want these motherfucking snakes off this motherfucking plane,

210
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,560
and they didn't have any of that,

211
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,420
and they were like, shit, we gotta make this movie

212
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,420
something.

213
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,140
He does say that line.

214
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,640
Well, he does now, it was a reshit.

215
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,060
But they added it.

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,700
That was for the fan, yeah.

217
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,920
So this is an example of fans dictate

218
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,760
what they want the movie to be,

219
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,700
which is now buy everything always.

220
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,540
So this listener,

221
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,700
so this listener who wrote this anonymous gripe

222
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,980
is worried that we see something about seats,

223
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,740
and maybe we never say seats again,

224
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,940
and maybe that's not what the audience wants.

225
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,100
We don't know, maybe that's not what the majority wants.

226
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,120
We take one message from that.

227
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,380
That's what his concern is.

228
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,520
You read a lot of like, you know.

229
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,060
Or he or she, excuse me.

230
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,500
Interviews with artists or musicians and stuff,

231
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
and big actors, and they're like,

232
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,220
oh, I don't really read the reviews,

233
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,020
I try not to let it get to me or get in my head,

234
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,320
I just kind of like, you know,

235
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,960
I have to just do what my gut tells, you know.

236
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,140
So I understand that to a certain point,

237
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,900
but we're not fielding, you know,

238
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,720
a million sort of like, then this is what the show is now.

239
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,380
It's all question and answer, it's all feedback.

240
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,560
We have our own gut.

241
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I don't know, Jason, I think maybe by the end of this,

242
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,060
I'm gonna change my philosophy.

243
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
I have a similar one to what Scott read.

244
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,040
It said, Michael, why did you do this?

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,760
You are a Pisces, and Pisces are too emotional

246
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,040
for this kind of thing, Jane.

247
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
So, you know, some to consider.

248
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,060
Now that Jane presumably being your girlfriend.

249
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
Coming from the other race, yeah, okay.

250
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,040
Yes, yes, my Jane.

251
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,060
I appreciate Jane's concern.

252
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
I appreciate her understanding

253
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
of what it's like to be a Pisces.

254
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,720
I appreciate that.

255
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,720
But I think that I, sometimes you have to put yourself

256
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,000
through some trials, you know,

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480
to come out stronger on the other end.

258
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,820
Sure, that's fair.

259
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,100
And I think that's what's going to happen today

260
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,960
is we comb through the gripes.

261
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,540
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,740
I feel that way already,

263
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,460
because there were a few that were like,

264
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,400
ooh, that is the meanest thing I've ever seen

265
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,260
related to me, and to me personally, and the show.

266
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,640
And it like did sting at first,

267
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,300
and then like, whatever, get over it, it's fine.

268
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,340
Because, boy, let's reiterate,

269
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
the fans of this show are so nice.

270
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,780
It's almost crazy that we did this

271
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,200
to counteract the niceness.

272
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,660
And there were also so many of the gripes

273
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,160
that were like, I don't have one.

274
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,140
You guys are great, and I'm all punchy in quarantine,

275
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,320
and I don't want to take it out on you.

276
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,500
It really speaks to the niceness of the fan base,

277
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,520
that many gripes were nice, or refusing to do the gripes.

278
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah.

279
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,820
Yes, they were nice gripes.

280
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,920
Can I kick us off with, I have one that's like,

281
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,180
a good conversation starter, I think.

282
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,460
because I am, I think, the hardest,

283
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
the biggest Universal stan.

284
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,320
I have been like the biggest proponent of Universal.

285
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,720
So I'll, I have some thoughts on this.

286
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,200
It says, you seem to cut Universal a lot more slack

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,580
than you do Disney, for the exact same stuff.

288
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,120
And I just find that odd.

289
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Okay, so I think I get it.

290
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,460
I think I see where they're coming from.

291
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,640
Like screens, or cutting corners,

292
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,640
like that's what I am guessing.

293
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,920
And I personally, yeah, I am a big Universal fan.

294
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,220
My family has had lots of nice memories at Universal.

295
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,900
So I am probably more likely to defend it.

296
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,820
I think the one thing though, personally,

297
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,520
if I'm as a podcaster with opinions on this stuff,

298
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,900
I may be cutting Universal more slack,

299
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,340
because I find overall Disney is cut way more slack

300
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,500
and Universal gets way more flack.

301
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,600
You guys ever know,

302
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,180
like the way people discuss some of this stuff,

303
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,640
it's like, all right, well, just,

304
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,060
for one, and the other part is,

305
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,420
there's different expectations here.

306
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,220
Like Disney's been in this business since the 50s.

307
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,140
Universal slowly got into it for decades,

308
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,700
but not really like all in like full speed ahead

309
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,260
until like the mid 80s and the early 90s.

310
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,160
So I think like there's more expectation with Disney

311
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,680
as like the multi-decade detail oriented company,

312
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,480
whereas Universal still, you know, similar money going on,

313
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,580
but like still more of the young upstart.

314
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,560
I think it's, I mean, I would like a couple examples

315
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,380
of what this griper, should we, griper, the griper maybe?

316
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,240
Sure, in this case, yeah, they were all grandfathers.

317
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,140
Griper is talking about,

318
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,380
I mean, there's probably some truth to that,

319
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,180
but I think you gotta have, yeah,

320
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,600
so Jason, as you're saying, there's different levels.

321
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,540
Like we're not mad at Knott's

322
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,820
for not having Rise of the Resistance, you know?

323
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,740
So we're gonna cut Knott's a lot of slack

324
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,260
in a lot of ways that we won't.

325
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,700
And then similar to Universal, Universal in like,

326
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
especially like is it 10 more years or even now,

327
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,980
okay, then you can start like a new park they build today,

328
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,200
I feel like we will give them the full, you know, criticism.

329
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,980
That being said, I don't know,

330
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,500
I feel like we goof on the lot of screens they have,

331
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,460
you know, I don't know.

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,460
Yeah.

333
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,880
I'm not sure exactly what you're saying.

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,320
Yeah, I know, I need for any concrete evidence of this,

335
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,280
but maybe what would settle the score is if,

336
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,500
what if Jason says something he doesn't like

337
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,720
about Islands of Adventure?

338
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,340
Maybe that's what has to be done.

339
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,940
Yes, Jason, will you throw, yeah,

340
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,660
say something bad about it, something you hate.

341
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,340
You can't be, I hate that I don't live there.

342
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,260
I don't live in the tower with the searchlight.

343
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah, I can't be the searchlight operator

344
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,980
and live in a little bed up there.

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,720
I hate, okay, yeah, that episode will be out by now.

346
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,460
I hate that they, I think they,

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
a problem with Islands of Adventure,

348
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,000
one of the problems with it is a problem

349
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
with a lot of the Vegas attractions that are gone now,

350
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,900
where it's like they gave it a year, maybe two years,

351
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,000
and they let a lot of stuff go to hell pretty quickly,

352
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,780
or they started cutting, like, okay,

353
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,960
we're not doing fireworks here,

354
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,620
that boat, the boat that'll take you across the water,

355
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,120
that's gone, the Dr.

356
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,300
Seuss people moving around

357
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,700
and they're like, oh, we're gonna move over

358
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,780
sort of a thing that goes above the land

359
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,460
that took like years and years and years to finish.

360
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,980
There was some stuff that they let go to rot

361
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,780
way too quickly and some improvements,

362
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,040
like they, I think the improvements have gotten better,

363
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,220
but they let the improvements go for too long.

364
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,280
That people move or ride whatever you're referring to,

365
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,480
it's some like flab-trap-ulous machine.

366
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,660
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,020
That's one of those, I waited in that line,

368
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,720
I don't know if it broke that day,

369
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,920
if it's just like a maddening line

370
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,820
that loops around and around and around,

371
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,320
and I think it was over an hour to then kind of go above

372
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,600
what you walk around already, that's a rough one.

373
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,300
If we're gonna throw things under the bus,

374
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,900
that one I am no fan of.

375
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,260
I feel like if I'd gotten on that

376
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,360
with a five minute wait, no problem,

377
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,820
but oh my God, it broke our brains

378
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,560
and we went there like over a decade ago.

379
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,660
Yeah.

380
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,180
And yeah, it's not, I'll say, like it's not,

381
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,740
the park isn't laid out the original Universal Florida,

382
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,940
park not so laid out well, how about that?

383
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,660
Like it's, it could be much better.

384
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,760
That's what I'll say.

385
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
So I don't know, is that harsh enough?

386
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,460
I don't know.

387
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,720
This is what I think, I think that we built up,

388
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,860
we saw some of the harshest things ever

389
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,960
and then this question and our answers were all so tame.

390
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,580
Every bit of it was the tamest thing.

391
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,760
I tried to phrase this one,

392
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,960
it's like a good conversation.

393
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,960
I think the ones I gravitated to

394
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,820
were like good conversation starters.

395
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,780
Okay, let me get into a different gripe.

396
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,080
We're gonna start slow here, folks.

397
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,240
The bill, okay, somebody said, yeah, I got a gripe.

398
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,840
You don't spend enough time talking about

399
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,300
how bad the Simpsons area of Universal is.

400
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,520
It's just so dismal.

401
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,080
The buildings are all wrong,

402
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,200
the flaming mos are green instead of purple,

403
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,820
but the thing that sent me over the edge

404
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,440
is that they serve special duff beer,

405
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,540
but it's not in a bottle or even a Moe's glass.

406
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,020
It's just a crappy beer in a plastic cup.

407
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,180
So what do we think about this?

408
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,260
Because this is actually not something

409
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,300
I've even thought about.

410
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,180
I've never even considered how inaccurate

411
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,740
this Simpsons land might be or is.

412
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
Well, I like this stuff.

413
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,160
That's why I'm not complaining about it.

414
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,120
I like Duff Gardens and I-

415
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,880
Yeah, I do too.

416
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,920
Yeah, and the duff beer, they were for a while,

417
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,520
it came in a bottle and they would pour it in a cup

418
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,860
and they're like, you can take a picture with the bottle,

419
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,260
but then we need it back because it was glass.

420
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,320
And yes, I would prefer people walking around

421
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,760
with minimal amounts of glass at a theme park.

422
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,840
Well, that's a practical insert.

423
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,680
The flaming Moe is wrong.

424
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,940
That is 100% true.

425
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,080
Yeah, it is wrong.

426
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,120
They messed that up.

427
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,920
That's bad, that's bad, bad, bad.

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,120
It's very bad and it's also a gross drink.

429
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,100
The drink should be actually good

430
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,660
because the flaming Moe from the sound of it

431
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,040
on the episode is delicious.

432
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
That sounds like the best drink ever.

433
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,300
It's all predicated on it being the best drink ever.

434
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,600
Yeah, I can picture in my,

435
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,380
do you think it is it kind of with the fruity

436
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,340
and the sugariness of it,

437
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,640
do you think it's kind of like a boysenberry beer,

438
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,520
but not electric?

439
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,540
Well, they say that there's cough syrup

440
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,820
and cough syrup I feel like is like kind of a grape-ish,

441
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,700
can be a grape-ish flavor.

442
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,460
So yeah, maybe it's adjacent to a boysenberry.

443
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:01,960
Could be.

444
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,680
So yeah, I feel like it's a delicious grape berry type

445
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,480
drink that has a little taste of medicine.

446
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,860
they taste medicinal but they're not?

447
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:16,980
Neko wafers, yeah.

448
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
They taste medicinal.

449
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,860
Neko wafers are like that.

450
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,780
I feel like there's a hint of medicinal quality

451
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,240
to the flaming Moe that they just didn't

452
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,760
spend too much time on.

453
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,120
And I think maybe they were a few years too late.

454
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
Because like Harry Potter rolls in

455
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,420
and then that's a whole new paradigm for a themed land.

456
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,240
Yeah.

457
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,080
And I don't think Matt Groening has the grip

458
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,980
on Universal like J.

459
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,140
K.

460
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,100
Rowling does as far as approvals.

461
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,320
Nobody maybe has never had a flaming Moe,

462
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,680
maybe never like stopped thinking about this

463
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,660
as soon as it was up and running.

464
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,780
Right, might be, yeah, might be checked out.

465
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,380
I don't know when it comes to theme park stuff.

466
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm not sure, but yes, he,

467
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,040
I will say I've actually just never thought about it

468
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,340
because I think what it is is with The Simpsons,

469
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,840
my expectations aren't for screen accuracy

470
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,780
like they are for other properties.

471
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,960
Right.

472
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,200
And maybe it's because of the nature

473
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,380
of The Simpsons itself, stuff moves around.

474
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,380
I know stuff is stacked on top of each other,

475
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,200
especially in the Universal Hollywood one.

476
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,660
And obviously that's not represented in any episode.

477
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,340
But I feel like The Simpsons is something

478
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,620
that I just feel like as long as it's kind

479
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,560
of partially represented, I'm okay with it

480
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,600
versus like if Hogwarts, I mean,

481
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,160
I'm not a big Harry Potter fan,

482
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,880
but if Hogwarts was all jacked up,

483
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,700
I might go, well, this doesn't seem right.

484
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,520
Yeah, I think also this person might not be remembering

485
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,280
that a lot of the buildings in that stretch beforehand

486
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,440
were very gray and most dire would have to be

487
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,860
the food served at the International Food

488
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,580
and Film Festival restaurant at Universal Studios,

489
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,840
which was really, I mean, rough.

490
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,780
I mean, that's another criticism of Universal.

491
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,740
I think it's gotten better in recent years

492
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,760
and there's some good table service restaurants

493
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,500
at the hotels and at CityWalk.

494
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
And then like Kunfisco Grill and Mythos

495
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,440
were always good at Islands of Adventure,

496
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,980
but some of the food stuff at Universal Florida

497
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,280
was kind of dire.

498
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,380
I will say though, this gripe got me thinking

499
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
and did kind of go, you know what?

500
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,840
We could demand better from a Simpsons property

501
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,120
and maybe at this point it has to be a Disney Simpsons land

502
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,540
because I don't think they can add to it.

503
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,660
But honestly, I hadn't really even considered this.

504
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,560
So this gripe made me think, and I appreciate that

505
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,420
about a good gripe, is that it put a thought into my head

506
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,120
that might have not been there before.

507
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
And now anytime I go by there,

508
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,660
I'm gonna be a little less happy.

509
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,340
Oh good, they ruined the cartoon beer place for you.

510
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,820
That's right.

511
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,460
I wanna congratulate this griper on ruining

512
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,340
a little bit of my happiness every time I walk by

513
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,440
Springfield in Hollywood.

514
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,000
I appreciate that they committed to Duff being like,

515
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,360
like an okay Budweiser.

516
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine, yeah.

517
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,380
I appreciate that, especially like,

518
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,940
I do not wanna walk around in Florida humidity

519
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,860
and drink like a double IPA.

520
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,240
That sounds awful to me.

521
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,320
I like the taste of like a hoppy beer sometimes,

522
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,700
but like it's a good walking around a theme park drink.

523
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,000
Theme parks and really basic beer do kinda go together.

524
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,020
I agree.

525
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,060
But although I've mentioned before,

526
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,100
they have holiday Duff that's pretty great.

527
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,620
It's like amber and good.

528
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,820
I have one that's similar might that's sort of,

529
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,700
it's directed at me and that did kind of change my

530
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,800
perspective on something and challenge me and made me think.

531
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,860
And it's it, it starts very threateningly.

532
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,640
Got a big gripe.

533
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,960
I didn't appreciate Scott making fun of the 1984

534
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,700
Tina Turner hit, What's Love Got To Do With It

535
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,300
on the Opryland episode.

536
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,900
It's a corny love song and I love it for being like that.

537
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,800
For being a synth enjoyer,

538
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,440
you should enjoy even the silliest of synth solos.

539
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,620
And yeah, I am a synth enjoyer.

540
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,540
And I felt a little snobby reading this.

541
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,480
I was like, yeah, no, but I know that solo.

542
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,700
That solo is silly.

543
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,900
And but you, all right, I know she's saying,

544
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,600
or they're saying enjoy silliness,

545
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,720
but I still can be demanding with.

546
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,100
And then I stepped back and I thought,

547
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,300
like, well, let me listen to that solo.

548
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,720
And then I mentally paired it with another song.

549
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Okay, I've said that I don't like the solo

550
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,260
in What's Love Got To Do With It.

551
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,300
And then I thought about a solo

552
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,560
that I do like and listen to.

553
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,880
And I listened to them back to back

554
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,700
and I realized that I am being ridiculous.

555
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,260
First, let me play the one that they are talking about.

556
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,360
This is from 1984,

557
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,720
is What's Love Got To Do With It

558
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,380
that I complained about a couple months ago.

559
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,680
["What's Love Got To Do With It"]

560
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,340
And I was being snobby about that.

561
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,340
And then I thought about one that I've said,

562
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,800
you know what I really like is this.

563
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,440
And this is from the song Valerie by Steve Winwood.

564
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,800
["Valerie"]

565
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,260
["Valerie"]

566
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,520
I mean, that's as flatulent as they come.

567
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,280
So who am I to-

568
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,280
Kazooie.

569
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,440
Yeah, ooh, very, very good word, yes.

570
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,180
They sampled a kazoo.

571
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,340
You know what, absolutely, that's right.

572
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,040
Dorky synth solos, I think beauty

573
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,960
is in the eye of the beholder.

574
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,660
And now I realize those are like almost identical

575
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
in their goofiness.

576
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,960
And now I'm like, you know what,

577
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,380
the goofier the better, whatever you want,

578
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,620
except for the recent Weezer covers and those synths.

579
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,820
Those are out for me no matter what.

580
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,360
Now that brings up a gripe I saw.

581
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:28,940
Oh, damn it.

582
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,180
Somebody said,

583
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,560
I like Weezer's cover of Take On Me

584
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,760
and don't understand what's bad about it.

585
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,420
That was a gripe.

586
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,480
Scott is getting a lot of gripes

587
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,860
for his music opinions.

588
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,900
I guess so.

589
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,740
Well, it's another synth one.

590
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,620
I just don't, if you're gonna do a cover,

591
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,560
don't you wanna do something to it?

592
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,960
Transform it.

593
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,020
Yes, any change, decision, make it like Weezer,

594
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,400
which I feel like they have done.

595
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
I think they have done covers and they Weezerified it.

596
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,700
All those covers, the Billie Jean

597
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,980
is the boringest shit I've ever heard.

598
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,640
It's a wedding band, they're a wedding band.

599
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,600
They did nothing, they brought nothing

600
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,300
about what you like about Weezer to those songs.

601
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,600
Oh God, it makes me so mad, that album.

602
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,280
I think that was a hit, right, the Take On Me?

603
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,240
Was it?

604
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,960
I think so.

605
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,180
I think one of those songs on that album was a decent hit.

606
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,460
It's sort of like the sometimes shot for shot

607
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,240
Disney live action remakes.

608
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,560
Why would you not just watch the animated one?

609
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,280
What would ever compel you to choose?

610
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,340
And even more so, because at least there are new things

611
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,000
and new actors in those live action movies.

612
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,040
Well, I think if you have a child,

613
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,000
if you have a child who gravitates toward,

614
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,500
you know, people, the kids especially latch on to stuff

615
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,120
they see very young, I think.

616
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,540
I can see that.

617
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,300
You're talking about Weezer's Take On Me?

618
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,480
Kids love it.

619
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,860
It would be my son's favorite song.

620
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,420
50 year old Rivers Cuomo more than the lead singer of Aha,

621
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,120
which I don't know.

622
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,320
Well, in some sense, like if you're eight or 10 years old,

623
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,300
and you're driving around,

624
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,180
if you're riding around in your parents' car

625
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,920
and that song comes on the radio, like you're not,

626
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,020
I guess now you can just on a phone,

627
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,880
you can pull up the original, but like, yeah,

628
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,060
they just might like the first version they heard, you know?

629
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,680
That's true.

630
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,500
Or adults could do that too.

631
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,200
I've heard covers before originals.

632
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,480
I mean, I am the biggest Weezer fan on the podcast.

633
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,360
I will say that album is not in heavy rotation

634
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,320
on my Weezer listening.

635
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,120
You've never been particularly a defender of it.

636
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,380
And even you were saying there's a newer Weezer

637
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,320
and I was dismissive and I listened to it.

638
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,960
I was like, yeah, fine.

639
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,100
I'd never put this on, but like this,

640
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,600
it's there in it.

641
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
I get it.

642
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,280
I get why you would listen to this.

643
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,360
Yeah, there's Beach Boys and Nelson in there.

644
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,080
Somewhere.

645
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,960
You can hear it.

646
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

647
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,720
But not these cranked out cover, these lazy.

648
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't even like take,

649
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,860
it's not like I'm such a stand for take on me either.

650
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,860
It's just like, just do something.

651
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,460
Change one thing about it.

652
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,700
You're not a big, I think take on me is fantastic.

653
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,560
Oh no, I like it.

654
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,740
I'm just not like, I don't know the name.

655
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,060
As with you, I don't know the names of the members.

656
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,120
I'm not like a hardcore aha person.

657
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,740
This is something, can I have a gripe with aha real quick?

658
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,680
I said, you know what?

659
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,000
I've been listening to take on me for my whole life

660
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,740
and I really like it.

661
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,240
Let me hear maybe other aha songs

662
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,020
that are as good as this.

663
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,440
And I did like the top 10 or whatever on Spotify

664
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,960
and I went, nothing is close.

665
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
No, not really.

666
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,000
As I recall, I like their James Bond song,

667
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,940
The Living Daylights.

668
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,260
Yes.

669
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,620
Yeah.

670
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,940
That's the one I would say.

671
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,180
I like it, but it's interesting.

672
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,280
It's like nothing is close to that level of like,

673
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,020
oh, everything is a fantastic hook.

674
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,880
Yeah.

675
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,020
There's other bands like that.

676
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,920
And I don't even mean to trash aha so much.

677
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,580
I was just thinking there has to be something

678
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,180
similar to this and it feels like

679
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,480
that was like a fluke almost.

680
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,980
Like a fluke, like as if fly happened with Sugar Ray

681
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,600
and then they didn't lean into being more of a pop band.

682
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,620
You know?

683
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,360
I guess.

684
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,880
Exactly like that.

685
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,200
I got really into a blur in high school

686
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,140
and starting with like their best of,

687
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,500
they have like a big long best of that's two CDs.

688
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,440
The second one is like a live concert

689
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,460
and it's all the hits and like the popular album cuts.

690
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,900
And then when I go back and try to do like albums,

691
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,160
I'm like, oh yeah, this just doesn't,

692
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,620
I think I just want the best.

693
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,060
I just want the like best of.

694
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,580
Sometimes some bands.

695
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,560
I'm going with that.

696
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,120
There's bands I would say are great.

698
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,960
That, you know, if you have eight to 10 great songs,

699
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,780
then I think you're great.

700
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,980
That's a miracle by the way.

701
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,380
That's not easy.

703
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,780
Absolutely.

704
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah, yeah.

705
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,020
It's just, it's like the greatest to the greatest

706
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,100
where all the album cuts are good too.

707
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,400
So that's that.

708
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,800
You want to keep going in a rotation, Jason?

709
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,460
You want to do one?

710
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,740
Yeah.

711
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Oh, here's a good one.

712
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:04,780
Okay.

713
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,100
This is also kind of universal.

714
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,320
This is as multiple parts.

715
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,560
And the second part is more conversant.

716
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,540
The first part I can answer immediately.

717
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,420
How have you not talked about the Spider-Man ride

718
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,120
at Universal?

719
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,680
The answer is we did.

720
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,520
In an episode dated April 12th, 2019.

721
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,000
So check that out.

722
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,100
True.

723
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,660
I think somebody realized, Jason,

724
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,140
I think if you go down in the gripes though,

725
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,400
the same person came back and realized that we had done.

726
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, okay.

727
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,320
Oh no.

728
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,840
All right.

729
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,400
But the rest of the gripe I do think is very interesting.

730
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,240
It's one of the most successful theme park rides

731
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,520
of all time and yet it has the most baffling

732
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,940
character selection for an IP ride.

733
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,980
Why does the Sister 6 only have five members?

734
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,080
Why Hobgoblin instead of Green Goblin?

735
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,100
Why Shriek instead of Venom?

736
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,940
And what's up with Scott Trowbridge?

737
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,360
He's obsessed with selecting obscure characters

738
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,080
for marquee attractions.

739
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,720
He created Spider-Man ride featuring the Sinister 5

740
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,500
and a Millennium Falcon ride featuring Hondo Anaka.

741
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,880
What other insane choices can we expect now

742
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,680
that he is the most senior Imagineer Latin at Disney?

743
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,540
I think I can answer some of this too,

744
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,280
which is in the 90s, Venom was like a complicated good guy.

745
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,280
So I don't think he was like,

746
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,620
I'm surprised he's not in the ride

747
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,600
because he was so popular.

748
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,740
I'm not surprised like when they needed a villain,

749
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,480
they just went to like a secondary symbiote.

750
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,340
I would have thought they would have gone with Carnage,

751
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,180
but his origin story is he is a serial killer

752
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,760
who has killed a lot of people

753
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,180
and that might be too heavy for a theme park.

754
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah, but the Joker's been in a theme park

755
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,460
and Joker's done some really awful shit.

756
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,660
I guess that's true, but he makes us all think, you know.

757
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,580
Maybe Trowbridge doesn't like Carnage.

758
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,740
Maybe he doesn't like symbiotes.

759
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,980
Well, I think the other thing is that like

760
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,700
a lot of the bigger characters,

761
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,000
especially with Star Wars with like the story committee

762
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,020
and stuff, there might just be too many like,

763
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,020
oh, it's gotta be, this has to be this in this way

764
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,500
and it's gotta behave this way.

765
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,100
But if you use a more ancillary character,

766
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,380
you have a little more wiggle room with like the jokes

767
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,840
and the prompts and stuff.

768
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,300
Maybe, yeah, perhaps that's what it is.

769
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,980
I mean, I think with Galaxy's Edge,

770
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,940
it's like, it seems like it's,

771
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,760
they were going away from like the legacy characters,

772
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,960
so to speak, and it takes place in a certain time

773
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,120
frame, so we weren't gonna see a famous character,

774
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,240
as famous of a character maybe.

775
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,020
Yeah, I mean.

776
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,040
Unless it was from the new trilogy.

777
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,720
A Chewie animatronic would have been cool,

778
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,760
but he shows up in the video footage.

779
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,520
Also, it's a little hard for Chewie

780
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,620
to give you a clear mission with words.

781
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,120
Yes.

782
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,640
I think that Hondo and Naka thing is cool.

783
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,180
I'd certainly never heard of that character before

784
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,380
and it does, it makes, it feels like more akin to a Rex,

785
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,460
a new character in Star Tours than like,

786
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,460
yeah, this is the thing that's kind of special to the ride,

787
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,020
even if they have existed before.

788
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,160
Yeah, I feel like people,

789
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,220
I feel like there's some people that complain

790
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,580
about Galaxy's Edge,

791
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,480
because like I'm certainly, I'm like,

792
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,040
let's just put all the characters in.

793
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,200
Give me the prequel characters,

794
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,620
give me the original trilogy

795
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,300
and put the new characters in there.

796
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,320
But I think some people are complaining about Hondo,

797
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
like that should be Han Solo or a famous character,

798
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,420
and I don't mind that at all.

799
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,660
That doesn't bother me at all,

800
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,300
having like a slightly obscure character in there,

801
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,440
because as Scott's saying, it feels like,

802
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,620
well, that's, Hondo is this original,

803
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,820
I mean, even though he's from whatever, Clone Wars,

804
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,080
it's like, well, I don't get to see Hondo a lot.

805
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,420
I'm not even that familiar with him

806
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,480
and I make, I become better friends with him

807
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,800
each time I go on this ride.

808
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,760
Like that's sort of how I feel about it.

809
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,120
So I'm all for Hondo being on that.

810
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
And I don't know, I wonder if, I wonder,

811
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
I wonder if Troll Bridge is a big,

812
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,700
is he like actually pushing these characters or yes,

813
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,080
is Jason saying, is it a mandate?

814
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm not sure, we need to have Scott on the show,

815
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,260
but I think until he works, doesn't work for Disney,

816
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,240
maybe that won't happen.

817
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,220
Yeah, I don't think we're getting current people probably.

818
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,800
Yeah, it's at least they can't be a candid as possible.

819
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,780
They can't gripe about Disney, you know?

820
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

821
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,460
That's what we're all about now,

822
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,400
especially me as an edgelord.

823
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,560
That's why, it's funny when we thought of this,

824
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,780
I wasn't an edgelord yet.

825
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,600
And now that I am, I am swimming in it.

826
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,800
Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's, what actually came first?

827
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,300
Is it your new attitude or is it the call for gripes?

828
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,140
I don't know.

829
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,940
Who knows what caused what?

830
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,820
Yeah, I don't know, it was all in the water.

831
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,740
All I know is that I'm an edgelord

832
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,520
and I eat up these gripes like it's delicious spaghetti.

833
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,620
I slurp them up, spit them back out at you

834
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,520
because I'm an edgelord.

835
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
Wow, very casual.

836
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,580
The most upbeat edgelord in the world.

837
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,380
Yeah, yeah, try to keep a positive attitude.

838
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,600
Edgelord doesn't have to be dour.

839
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,340
Yeah, nice bringing your step, you know?

840
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,740
Oh sure.

841
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,140
You make people smile.

842
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,040
I got to.

843
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,160
All right, I feel bad about this gripe

844
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,720
and I'm gonna say it now here.

845
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,000
So, and then they did not do the gripe intro,

846
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,620
but that's okay.

847
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Mike implied Tyler Mane, who plays Sabretooth

848
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,500
in the X-Men movies, had died

849
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,080
in the Villain Ted Halloween episode

850
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,700
and caused me a moment of sadness

851
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,360
because he was very nice to me at a convention.

852
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,120
Thankfully, he's still with us.

853
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,560
So, I know exactly what happened here.

854
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,260
I know exactly what I did

855
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,020
and I am very sorry to Mr.

856
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,600
Tyler Mane

857
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,880
and anyone who was confused.

858
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,660
I was thinking of the actor who played Bane

859
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,300
in Batman and Robin, Jeep Swenson,

860
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,040
who has sadly passed away.

861
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,600
And I was confusing, these movies came out

862
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,580
within a couple years of each other.

863
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,820
I was confusing two wrestler guys

864
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,780
who were not huge names in the companies.

865
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,180
I was confusing these two wrestler names

866
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,380
and confusingly said that Tyler Mane had passed away.

867
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,380
He is still alive, I apologize.

868
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,660
That's my bad.

869
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,200
That's good one.

870
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,020
You know, it's really one of the balancing acts

871
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,720
of doing this podcast is trying to remember stuff

872
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,340
off the dome versus how much do you look at

873
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,920
while you're, like look stuff up while you're recording

874
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,760
because you don't wanna slow down every conversation with,

875
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,760
let me look that up.

876
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,240
Yes, I know, yes.

877
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,360
Sometimes you reach for something and it's not there.

878
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
It's not there.

879
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,640
Or you say the wrong guy is dead and he's not.

880
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,800
It's not and it was always very mentally taxing

881
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
in COVID times.

882
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,240
It is, it's just not even, it's just impossible.

883
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,960
Like my memory.

884
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,200
I don't know if I'd say very.

885
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,560
You get very mentally taxed

886
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,120
because you can't remember a thing.

887
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,040
I trying to like keep a lot of balls in the air,

888
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,780
keep the conversation going, look at your notes,

889
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,040
like in terms of like a recording performance aspect,

890
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,180
it can be difficult.

891
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,240
So maybe not very mentally taxing,

892
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,540
but it's certainly a thing.

893
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,120
But like my memory is just shot during this day and age.

894
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,020
It's become to the point where like the conversations

895
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,320
about which day is it?

896
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,840
It's like, I don't even know it's Pat.

897
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,320
I don't wanna keep doing that.

898
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Like what I, it doesn't matter if we know what day.

899
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,160
It's fine.

900
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,200
There's some.

901
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,460
Sure.

902
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,600
There's one that maybe similarly is about some fudged info.

903
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,080
First of all, let me say, I really like,

904
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,600
I think we announced this episode around when,

905
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,700
right when we did the Fast and Furious and Living Seas.

906
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,140
So a lot of the gripes are about those.

907
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,560
And that makes sense because they just happened

908
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,040
and people are on the hunt for gripes.

909
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,060
But I really like when there is a gripe

910
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,820
that is from forever ago.

911
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,320
And that's what this one is.

912
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,220
And it's also some fuzziness on my part.

913
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,620
Or so they think.

914
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,400
Okay.

915
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,820
On the Splash Mountain episode,

916
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,180
that's in the first 20 or so.

917
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,700
On the Splash Mountain episode,

918
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,560
Scott mentioned a picture on Flash Mountain,

919
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,020
you know, where people would show their boobs or whatever,

920
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
and it would end up on some site.

921
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,620
If you did something weird, essentially,

922
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,280
on Splash Mountain when going down the drop.

923
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,680
And I mentioned a picture of somebody

924
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,720
with a video game console,

925
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,160
quote, playing Donkey Kong on an Xbox.

926
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,500
This was my first red flag

927
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,100
that Scott Gardner is one sick fuck.

928
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,960
Donkey Kong is, of course, a Nintendo property

929
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,580
and would never and will never be seen

930
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,280
on a Microsoft console.

931
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,220
Furthermore, the game from the picture

932
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,820
was Super Smash Brothers Melee on GameCube.

933
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,140
Me think Scott had a few too many sips of wine that day.

934
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,120
Fair enough.

935
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,860
Fair enough.

936
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,120
But let me say that.

937
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,480
Okay, so you assume that I'm talking about

938
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,060
some specific one with Super Smash Brothers Melee

939
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,900
on a GameCube.

940
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,620
How do you know that I'm not talking about

941
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,200
a different one entirely?

942
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,600
How do you know that I'm not talking about

943
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,060
the time that somebody went on Splash Mountain with?

944
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,300
Well, let me pull up a video to explain what I'm talking about.

945
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,780
You say that Donkey Kong has never been on Xbox.

946
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,560
Well, what do you say about this video

947
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,060
from several months before our Splash Mountain episode

948
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,900
where somebody has rigged up Donkey Kong bongos

949
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,920
to control the racing game Forza X,

950
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,180
or, I'm sorry, Forza 7 on Xbox One X?

951
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,480
This is a video they figured out how to use

952
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,040
Donkey Kong's bongos to control a race car.

953
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,540
You remember this, right?

954
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,860
You guys, we all remember how viral this video went.

955
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,680
Oh, of course.

956
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,320
It was the winter of 2017 and I'll never forget.

957
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,640
Yeah, yeah, it was the talk of the internet.

958
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,980
And obviously several months before we recorded that episode.

959
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,420
So how do you know, Anonymous Griper,

960
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,900
that I am not talking about that I saw people

961
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,520
go down Splash Mountain with this setup,

962
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,320
rigging up bongos to play Xbox?

963
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,740
That is what I saw.

964
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,820
I saw it.

965
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,660
It's now I checked it's been scrubbed from the internet

966
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,720
so I can't prove it, but that clearly is what happened.

967
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,600
Somebody took an Xbox with Donkey Kong bongos.

968
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,180
And you can blame it on me being one sick fuck

969
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,360
and having too much wine.

970
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,920
And that part I won't deny.

971
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,280
I am sick and it's the wine that makes me sick

972
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,340
and I don't ever wanna get well.

973
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,860
That's the end of this gripe.

974
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,860
Wow, that was an epic gripe clap back, I guess?

975
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,400
Yeah.

976
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,820
Which is a first on the show.

977
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh, I clap back at this.

978
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,420
This person will never show their cursor

979
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,060
in the gripe box again.

980
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,920
I proved definitively that somebody took

981
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,820
a rigged up Xbox on Splash Mountain.

982
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,120
Wow.

983
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,060
And you were likely, you might've been coming off

984
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,240
another podcast, you made an appearance

985
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,080
where maybe you were discussing the N64 game,

986
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,640
Perfect Dark, which is developed by Rare for N64.

987
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,040
And eventually they did re-release it on Xbox 360.

988
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,340
Yeah.

989
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,260
And the ownership of the Rare company

990
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,820
gets very complicated and I believe,

991
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,580
I'm doing this off the dome a little,

992
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,960
but I believe Rare, they did GoldenEye

993
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,580
and yes, they helped with Donkey Kong and Banjo-Kazooie,

994
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,960
which were of course N64 games.

995
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,200
Yes, yes.

996
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,800
There's so many, there's been so many ways

997
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
to play Donkey Kong on an Xbox over the years.

998
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,580
And that's why I said that thing that I said

999
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,040
many, many years ago.

1000
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,840
And if it took, if you didn't do the proper research

1001
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,580
to realize that, then I can't help you.

1002
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,600
Wow.

1003
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,800
All right, well we got a lot to live up to.

1004
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,700
I don't think anyone of us is gonna clap back.

1005
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,880
Everybody's gotta clap back as hard as you can,

1006
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,540
even if it's the softest thing,

1007
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,080
even if they're really nice to you in it.

1008
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,800
Clap back.

1009
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,580
All right, Jason, Jason, get geared up here.

1010
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,160
Okay.

1011
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,980
Clap and level.

1012
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,600
Okay.

1013
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,100
Baby Aladar is neither cute nor ugly.

1014
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,700
He has transcended what can be classified

1015
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,480
as mortal or earthly and can no longer be judged

1016
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,300
by such fleshy qualifications.

1017
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,200
He is my world, he is my Alice star.

1018
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,040
You must subject yourself to him immediately

1019
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,380
or face the wrath of a 10,000 lemurs.

1020
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,480
I mean, that's fair.

1021
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,780
That's really fair.

1022
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,780
Hard to clap back at that one, I suppose.

1023
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,620
Hard to clap back at that one.

1024
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,260
Seems right to me.

1025
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,800
I mean, seems, I get it.

1026
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,300
To break from the bouncing around pattern,

1027
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,460
I think there was a lot of dinosaur divisiveness.

1028
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,760
Some of it's about Aladar.

1029
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,800
I noticed some things about the good dinosaur.

1030
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,180
People were defending the good dinosaur,

1031
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,980
often in ways that still seem like they didn't like it,

1032
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,500
but were, I don't know, still something.

1033
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,160
Somebody said, I think you owe an apology

1034
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,940
to dinosaurs everywhere and promise to be more inclusive

1035
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,380
of dinosaurs in the future.

1036
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,460
And somebody called us low energy on that episode.

1037
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:50,860
What?

1038
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,760
Was this Trump?

1039
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,920
I think it was Trump.

1040
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,240
That's one of the things he says.

1041
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,120
The dinosaur, yeah, the dinosaur episode.

1042
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,680
Somebody said we were low energy.

1043
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,700
We have to redo it.

1044
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,800
Well, I guess so.

1045
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,320
Well, it was just so dark in there.

1046
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,180
We made all our studio spaces pitch black

1047
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,580
to simulate dinosaurs.

1048
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,400
We got a little sleepy.

1049
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,520
Yeah, exactly.

1050
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,160
That's right.

1051
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,300
So we'll redo it eventually in 2028.

1052
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,060
But we're gonna redo all the quarantine ones

1053
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,900
like better since we're sad.

1054
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,420
Special editions.

1055
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,080
Although, somebody brought up,

1056
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,980
let me go real quick to this.

1057
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,300
You should redo the Indiana Jones Adventure episode

1058
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,440
since it was the first episode

1059
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,700
and only covers the ride for a small portion of the episode.

1060
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,100
And I say, I agree.

1061
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,440
I agree 100%.

1062
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,900
Let's announce now we're gonna do this.

1063
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,820
Oh man.

1064
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,360
Maybe not so soon.

1065
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,040
Amount voted.

1066
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,400
But I think you've been outvoted

1067
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,460
if we just all had a vote of enthusiasm.

1068
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,220
We have talked about revisiting earlier ones.

1069
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah.

1070
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,480
You were the most excited about that.

1071
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,680
You've been on anything on the,

1072
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
doing something again.

1073
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:56,920
Yes.

1074
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,580
Yeah.

1075
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,520
That's the opposite of low energy.

1076
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,540
Again, again.

1077
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,200
But there's new things to do.

1078
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,720
Don't we wanna do new things?

1079
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,400
You know, but you rewrite, you know,

1080
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,440
you wanna rewrite that ride, you know.

1081
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,740
There's other angles.

1082
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,940
There's other, yeah, there's other ways to do it.

1083
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,680
There are a few I think you could do again,

1084
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,240
but I'm worried about a slippery slope here

1085
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,800
where now we're doing the City Walk Saga 2.

1086
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,140
We're just doing it all again.

1087
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,820
We're, I think you flow to the idea

1088
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,660
of doing more of the same City Walk Saga to be honest.

1089
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,800
Doing more of it again?

1090
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,700
I think so.

1091
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,260
Or at least we've talked about the fact

1092
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,180
that it's gonna change so much, we'll have to do it again.

1093
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,560
I mean, I'm a proponent of new sectors when they come up.

1094
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,360
and Popcornopolis.

1095
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,980
What if Zen Zone installs new water coffins

1096
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,140
and we have to try them out?

1097
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,020
If something new, if there's a new element to something,

1098
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,940
don't you think we would have to then go in and try it again?

1099
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,300
No, I'd be fine with that, yes.

1100
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,880
Yeah, new is the operative word, yes.

1101
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,560
But like with Weezer, you have to add something to it

1102
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,620
to make it new and fresh.

1103
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,880
Say the coffins are the same type of coffins,

1104
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,800
you're just newer so they work better.

1105
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,460
Oh yeah, or if they're like green vinyl,

1106
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,580
hitting your back instead of blue vinyl.

1107
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,100
No, I'm on board with every one of these.

1108
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,040
You haven't lost me on any of them.

1109
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,440
It's going, it's doing anything that hasn't changed.

1110
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:22,980
That's my…

1111
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,460
Well, I'm not saying we go back in and revisit

1112
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,220
the Ace Ventura Disney's Hollywood Studio show yet.

1113
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,400
I'm not saying that, but I am saying maybe some of the heavy

1114
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,360
hitters, some of the stuff that it feels like you could talk

1115
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,900
ad nauseam about because they're so great or so fruitful.

1116
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,320
Well, yeah, sequels.

1117
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,440
I'm just worried that that heavy hitter definition

1118
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,940
suddenly expands and now we're doing Day in the Park

1119
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,160
with Barney Six.

1120
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,600
Well, yeah, we all have a couple different heavy hitters

1121
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,460
probably in the categories that maybe Jason or you don't have,

1122
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,420
but yeah, is there more Rift talk coming on this show?

1123
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,520
Of course there is.

1124
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,900
Yeah, absolutely.

1125
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,580
And they closed Day in the Park with Barney as well.

1126
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,040
I know.

1127
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,080
That's apparently closed forever.

1128
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,300
Rest in peace.

1129
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,820
Yeah, it's gonna make it a lot harder

1130
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,700
to do six episodes about it.

1131
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,380
Right, I mean, that's like, we're gonna have to have

1132
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,240
a really thin excuse to do something,

1133
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,780
which is rare for this show.

1134
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,420
We have the thickest excuses in the business.

1135
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,980
That is the new tagline for the show,

1136
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,080
the thickest excuses in the business.

1137
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,820
That replaces childless men in their 30s.

1138
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,720
Are you up, Mike?

1139
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,780
Well, I just did the Indiana Jones thing.

1140
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,460
I guess that didn't count as a full,

1141
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,940
maybe it's not a full gripe, so I can do a full gripe.

1142
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,280
Well, I have one to throw your way.

1143
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,940
I hate to direct one, put you in the line of fire.

1144
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,820
No, no, hit me with it.

1145
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,040
But you can always go back.

1146
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,460
Yeah, I got a gripe for you.

1147
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,660
In the Tato Park episode, Mike was waiting to receive

1148
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,160
the Mr.

1149
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,500
Tato autobiography, The Man Inside the Jacket,

1150
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,320
and he's never talked about it,

1151
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,340
despite promising an addendum.

1152
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,860
What am I supposed to do?

1153
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,400
Also risk getting my credit card stolen?

1154
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,820
Hell no.

1155
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,120
I need to do here a, and it's the acronym

1156
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,720
that I think is too long, didn't read,

1157
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,120
of this surely incredible tome, please, and thank you.

1158
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,620
Okay, so what happened is real quick refresher

1159
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,240
is that on the Tato Park episode.

1160
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,680
Which is a park devoted to potatoes,

1161
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,760
and there's a potato mascot who is a big potato, Mr.

1162
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:24,740
Tato.

1163
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,080
Crisp, yes.

1164
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,300
Like an hour or two before,

1165
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,180
and I was doing some last second research,

1166
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,120
I saw that there was some sort of autobiography,

1167
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,060
supposedly written by Mr.

1168
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,380
Tato about himself,

1169
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,820
and I was on some website that was pretty shady

1170
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,840
that offered me a digital copy.

1171
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,600
Now I think what this website was

1172
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,520
is that if you just search for a book and digital,

1173
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,360
it'll kind of give you a fake facsimile

1174
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,640
of what that might be, and try to trick you

1175
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,820
into putting your credit card information in,

1176
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,160
in order to steal your identity,

1177
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,400
or just to buy some expensive clothes online or whatever.

1178
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,300
So I was in such a rush, I did it,

1179
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,100
thinking that it might be legitimate,

1180
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,960
and I will say that this doesn't end spectacularly.

1181
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,580
Basically the credit card charge was declined,

1182
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,880
I don't think my credit card was stolen,

1183
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,540
I was monitoring the activity.

1184
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,360
It was absolutely a fraudulent website though,

1185
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,780
it was not legitimate.

1186
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,300
I should not have put my information in there.

1187
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,800
As far as I know, nothing has happened yet.

1188
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,000
I guess this could be a long game of identity theft,

1189
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,060
maybe even by Mr.

1190
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,820
Tato himself.

1191
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,180
I don't know all the players in this type of agency.

1192
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh, but he's such a rule follower, remember?

1193
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,260
He was like a prude, he's telling people to cover up,

1194
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,040
and be more modest in those weird commercials we saw.

1195
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,140
Right, Jason has sent me a copy of a website now

1196
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,360
where I can purchase the book for a very low price.

1197
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,700
A very low price, but a high shipping fee.

1198
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,500
This is Biblio, which I believe is the largest

1199
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,700
used book website in America.

1200
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,260
I've spent a lifeline for me.

1201
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,960
I will say, yeah, sometimes if you're an eBay shopper,

1202
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,360
you'll notice that oftentimes the price of an item

1203
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,440
will be very low, but the shipping will be very high,

1204
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,580
and you have to pay attention for that,

1205
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,780
and that seems to be what's going on here

1206
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,400
with a $4 price and a $12 shipping.

1207
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,620
Although it is shipping to US if this is coming from Europe,

1208
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,020
so that is a bit more expensive.

1209
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,320
So I will make this guarantee, I will purchase this book.

1210
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,780
I will not get defrauded.

1211
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,940
There will be, again, we will find one of the thickest

1212
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,160
excuses to talk about Mr.

1213
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,340
Tato and his life story

1214
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,600
in a future episode, I swear.

1215
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,840
Such a thick excuse.

1216
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,440
So I apologize for not updating on that,

1217
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,480
the update in that, but I wanted to wait

1218
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,260
until I actually had a book in hand,

1219
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,580
and Jason has now given me a way to do it

1220
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,040
in a very $20-ish way.

1221
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,320
I will buy the book, you can buy the shipping.

1222
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,500
How about that?

1223
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Very generous.

1224
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
That's your penance, that's your penance

1225
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,820
for not doing more Silk Road potato mascot bookshops.

1226
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,940
Can you do that line as if Wimpy was saying it?

1227
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,000
I'll gladly pay you for the book.

1228
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,320
I'll gladly pay you for the book

1229
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,720
if you cover the shipping.

1230
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,080
Wait, I actually, I just didn't document it,

1231
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:25,840
but on Biblio, I did buy, there was no cover image.

1232
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,440
I have a copy.

1233
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,960
This I will promise in no speedy manner,

1234
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,040
but I will do a book report episode

1235
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,900
about the Harlequin romance novel

1236
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,280
that is set at Walt Disney World.

1237
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,500
I forget the title of it, I don't have it in front of me,

1238
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,680
but that was going around the internet for a few days,

1239
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,160
and I did track it down.

1240
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,640
I think our listeners bought a lot of the copies

1241
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,560
that were out there, and I got one of the last ones.

1242
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,760
And it took about a month to get here,

1243
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,960
but it did get here.

1244
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,700
It does have a couple swooning in front of Spaceship Earth.

1245
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,120
It's really quite a beautiful cover.

1246
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,740
Yeah, please, fill us in.

1247
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,980
Well, that was kind of a rapid fire.

1248
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,060
We sort of all did one.

1249
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,020
Do you wanna go back to Jason?

1250
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,960
Sure, yeah, go for it.

1251
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:19,680
Sure.

1252
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,000
Hi, PTR, I have a gripe.

1253
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,800
In the Frozen Every After episode,

1254
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,920
you guys say that no college-age kids listen to your show.

1255
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,220
I am college-age and listen to your show every week,

1256
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,660
and I was for sure judging you old people

1257
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,040
for your back issues.

1258
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,800
JK loved the show.

1259
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,760
I laughed at that one.

1260
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,560
I think I was not present in that conversation

1261
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,260
that Frozen Every After episode,

1262
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,320
because I spent a significant portion

1263
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,600
of the later part of college listening,

1264
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,760
walking around campus listening to podcasts

1265
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,460
in the early days of podcasting.

1266
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,320
So yeah, I absolutely do.

1267
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,400
There were some podcasts.

1268
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,780
College kids listening to the podcast.

1269
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,060
I think people took that too seriously on my part.

1270
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,620
I think I was being a little facetious

1271
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,440
in an episode with as many of them are

1272
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,560
with sort of old man references.

1273
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,520
Yes.

1274
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,980
I feel like I was like, oh, we don't have any,

1275
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,920
but yeah, I do appreciate people raising their hands though.

1276
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,120
And yeah, it's always great to hear they exist.

1277
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,060
I think we were giving you guys credit

1278
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,940
for being like cool and young and on the cutting edge.

1279
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,520
And like, well, surely they won't listen to these old times.

1280
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,400
We hopefully we aren't ruining promising lives

1281
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,280
with the lame niche interests, but I guess we are.

1282
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,000
I think we are.

1283
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,120
But I apologize.

1284
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,300
Oh man, college, I had plenty of niche interests.

1285
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,140
That Mr.

1286
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,540
Pibb, yeah.

1287
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,240
It was an exciting time the first years of YouTube,

1288
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,300
buying snakes on a plane, T-shirts, fan made

1289
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,740
and the Chronicles of Narnia rap video

1290
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,020
really hitting big, you know?

1291
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,700
The comic book Excalibur.

1292
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,640
Yeah.

1293
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,520
My favorite thing about that time really quick is how,

1294
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,980
all right, so yeah, there was Lazy Sunday on SNL

1295
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,520
that kind of like changed the show

1296
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,380
and launched Andy Samberg into the stratosphere.

1297
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,540
And what I like is that there was also

1298
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,060
a lot of people doing like Lazy Monday

1299
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,180
who were doing like, all right, you guys on SNL,

1300
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,580
we're gonna show you how we do it on the West Coast.

1301
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,280
And they, like, there was so many things like that.

1302
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,100
Notably none of whom rocketed into the stratosphere

1303
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,520
like Andy Samberg.

1304
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,660
Like the Lazy Sunday disses and baits into a rap battle.

1305
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,160
You'll notice that they did not feel the need to respond

1306
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,720
and do a diss track back and forth.

1307
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,180
That was a fun time.

1308
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,920
That was a good.

1309
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,900
It was a fun time.

1310
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:57,240
I remember a brief period where I kept taking my laptop

1311
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,900
to the tech support on campus.

1312
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,200
And I'm like, why does the website YouTube not work on Macs?

1313
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,560
And they're like, something's going on.

1314
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,280
Like, it's not supported right now.

1315
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,660
And it's like, can you imagine not getting,

1316
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,360
like there was a time where not only could you not get

1317
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,280
YouTube like on your refrigerator,

1318
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,380
you could, it wouldn't work on a Macintosh.

1319
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:20,900
At all?

1320
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,280
What a time.

1321
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,700
Wow.

1322
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,700
You know, at all.

1323
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah.

1324
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,600
It's wild.

1325
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,480
I think it was a bug and I think it was resolved

1326
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,520
reasonably quickly, but it's like, oh yeah.

1327
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,500
Now I just like flip on YouTube, like drinking water.

1328
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,640
It's crazy.

1329
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,440
Mike, you got anything?

1330
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,180
Yeah, this is a quick one.

1331
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,280
Somebody says they got a gripe.

1332
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,220
Yeah, I got a gripe.

1333
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:43,480
All right.

1334
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,960
I feel like the world of Sid and Marty Croft

1335
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,900
got overshadowed by Hard Rock Park

1336
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,540
since they were in the same episode.

1337
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,280
And I also very much agree with this gripe.

1338
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,720
Yeah.

1339
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,100
I think at the time, you know,

1340
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,140
we were still figuring out the show and we were like,

1341
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,860
well, I don't know, will we have enough to talk about

1342
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,440
about Hard Rock Park?

1343
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,020
That was an educational episode for sure.

1344
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,720
That was one, yeah, we had to,

1345
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,380
we realized midway through it had to be split.

1346
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,060
We felt so insane.

1347
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,800
I think that still counts even though it's a two-part.

1348
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,380
I think that's the longest we were ever recording

1349
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,780
in one stint.

1350
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,880
And it's truly demented now to think that we thought

1351
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,680
we could do both parks in one.

1352
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,160
Yeah, like if we, if we, right now we would be like,

1353
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,420
oh, have you heard about Hard Rock Park?

1354
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,920
And then like, you would Google it and you go,

1355
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,420
Winston the punk rock dog.

1356
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,200
And then we go, well, we got 90 minutes right here

1357
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,580
at the very least.

1358
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,540
So it is crazy to think about the old days.

1359
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,280
I saw a couple of gripes also about segments.

1360
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,920
Some people miss the segments we would throw in

1361
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,500
a lot more often during the first few years.

1362
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,900
And I can't disagree with that either.

1363
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,700
These are legitimate gripes.

1364
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,960
I think we could be adding a few more segments here and there.

1365
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,560
Yeah, yeah.

1366
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,740
But I also think, I also think early on,

1367
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,140
we were just trying stuff out.

1368
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,700
We were feeling it out, you know?

1369
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,460
It's before the era of the like two hour,

1370
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,360
two and a half hour.

1371
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,460
Like I think we didn't, like being new at it,

1372
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,300
I think we felt like, can we even do 90 minutes?

1373
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,480
And now we know we can do it off of nothing.

1374
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,380
We even, with a not thick excuse to do an episode.

1375
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,000
Right, riff.

1376
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,200
I mean, riff, yeah, we would, I wouldn't have,

1377
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,040
I wouldn't have known like riff would be like a 30 minute

1378
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,060
topic of conversation before.

1379
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,460
So yeah, we apologize.

1380
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,940
I do think Sid and Marty Croft,

1381
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,420
there's gotta be other theme park stuff.

1382
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,720
I am fascinated by all of those weird characters.

1383
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,940
And we have to, we still have, we still owe a McDonald,

1384
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,800
like a pure McDonald land episode.

1385
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,760
Oh yes.

1386
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,000
So then there's connection to that

1387
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,760
because they ripped off Sid and Marty Croft.

1388
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,440
So I think there will be more

1389
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,980
Sid and Marty Croft material coming.

1390
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,860
Practically too.

1391
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,440
I think as we were doing that episode,

1392
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,040
there was not a ton of scans of like

1393
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,800
the Sid and Marty Croft park online, scans or footage.

1394
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,040
And as the years have gone on,

1395
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,080
more stuff has been uploaded.

1396
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,780
Either video or.

1397
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,700
Yeah, yeah.

1398
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,320
Yeah, so that is, you know, there is a certain point

1399
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,580
with some of the more obscure stuff where it's like,

1400
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,540
I have hit a wall, like I've run out of things

1401
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,940
I can search or search for.

1402
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,020
It makes it hard with like some like kind of,

1403
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,400
like some seventies rides a little bit.

1404
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,460
Like there's just not a ton out there.

1405
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,680
Yeah, you do.

1406
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,360
I don't know if we're more recent,

1407
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,640
it might be for reasons like that.

1408
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,460
I have another, it was going off of McDonald land.

1409
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,640
I have a food related gripe

1410
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,380
that I do think is an important one.

1411
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,940
Yeah, I got a gripe all right.

1412
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:49,440
I don't need, well, this was the Fast and the Furious one.

1413
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,620
How dare the Rock and by extension, you good boys,

1414
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,200
think that the term cookie puss is an insult.

1415
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,040
That's something the Rock says in that attraction.

1416
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,320
And I judged it as an insult, but he says,

1417
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,920
we should all be so lucky to be associated

1418
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,000
with Carvel's celestial person from outer space.

1419
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,480
If being made of delicious soft serve ice cream

1420
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,620
and delicious crunchies is wrong,

1421
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,160
then I don't wanna be right.

1422
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,160
I am particularly upset with Jason, no, no,

1423
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,520
as the East Coast and treats good boy representative

1424
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,780
for not defending cookie puss.

1425
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,720
He also has themes.

1426
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,720
During St.

1427
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,800
Patrick's day, he is cookie opuss.

1428
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,620
I know all about cookie opuss.

1429
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,340
I know what you're gonna say, yeah.

1430
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,620
I demand extended time to discuss cookie puss.

1431
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,800
He is at the very least deserving of a five minute tangent.

1432
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,800
Nothing wrong was said there.

1433
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,640
No clapping back to be done there.

1434
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,260
I mean, cookie puss rocks.

1435
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,460
All the Carvel universe stuff rocks.

1436
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,360
I think in the context of the Fast and Furious ride,

1437
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,060
that was literally, they were sitting around

1438
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,880
writing dialogue and like, oh, that's a,

1439
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,080
what's a funny thing for him to say?

1440
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,820
What's a funny thing for him to call him?

1441
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,940
Like, this has gotta be G rated.

1442
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,520
This has gotta be PG at worst.

1443
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,820
Like, oh, I don't, and someone's like,

1444
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,620
that's, it's a funny name.

1445
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,880
It's a very funny phrase.

1446
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,200
So I think that's, that would be my guess.

1447
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,000
I do would, I do still think it is an insult and not,

1448
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,120
but not, I think because of the phrases,

1449
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,060
it's not the harshest insult potentially,

1450
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,400
but yeah, no one is casting aspersions on cookie puss,

1451
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,980
who is great.

1452
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,380
If you haven't seen cookie puss,

1453
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:31,960
he is a cake face with a nose that is an ice cream cone.

1454
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,420
And he's very cool.

1455
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,360
I'll do a quick clap back here.

1456
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,940
Just a quick one.

1457
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,100
I'm not gonna do an epic one.

1458
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,000
I'm just gonna say, here's the thing though.

1459
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,080
Calling someone, let's say Bozo, hey Bozo,

1460
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,840
first of all, kind of a neutral insult in this day and age,

1461
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,180
but I'll say this about Bozo.

1462
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,100
I'm a big fan of Bozo the Clown.

1463
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,960
So you can sort of use it.

1464
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,060
It is sort of whatever your intention is, you know,

1465
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,960
means more than actually the word you're saying,

1466
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,040
I think sometimes.

1467
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,640
Cause like Bozo is a beloved clown,

1468
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,200
many versions of him.

1469
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,520
I like a lot of the different versions of Bozo,

1470
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,720
but I would recognize it as an insult.

1471
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,340
So that's my slight clap back.

1472
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,320
Doesn't mean the person saying that hasn't watched

1473
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,940
and enjoyed Bozo at some point in time.

1474
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,080
Maybe it's that like, you know, with Fast and Furious,

1475
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:25,180
they're heading into a big high octane, high artillery,

1476
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,580
heist or mission or something.

1477
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,920
I still don't really know.

1478
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,980
And it's maybe a situation where, what was that?

1479
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:34,840
Chase.

1480
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,700
Chase, sure.

1481
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,660
Yeah.

1482
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,760
Expedition something.

1483
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,780
And it's maybe a situation where I don't know that Cookie Puss

1484
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,840
as great as he is.

1485
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,140
I don't know that he, an ice cream cake would get a lot done

1486
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,220
in that particular mission.

1487
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,560
Although maybe I'd love him to always be around

1488
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,420
no matter what.

1489
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,300
I wish he was by my side right now.

1490
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,140
Of course.

1491
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,480
Also, we can't like do jump on every,

1492
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,380
like I've got to defend this or like,

1493
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,560
well, I actually know an interesting fact

1494
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,020
about that ice cream purveyor.

1495
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,900
And then like, you got away like,

1496
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,260
oh, is the episode wrapping up?

1497
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,180
Are we about to go into another thing?

1498
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,300
You know, like, should I derail this

1499
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,580
to explain the Carvel universe?

1500
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,580
I guess in this case, yes, was the answer.

1501
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,960
Maybe not every case, but.

1502
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:21,760
Kind of, yeah.

1503
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,580
In this one.

1504
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,600
And I, and it's.

1505
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,700
As far as Carvel.

1506
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,040
Well, Carvel, yeah, Carvel probably deserves its own.

1507
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,020
I don't know.

1508
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,480
It was always kind of mysterious to me

1509
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,200
because there was no Carvel outlets,

1510
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,420
but we would certainly have the like,

1511
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,260
default ice cream cakes for like,

1512
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,280
school birthdays or parties and stuff.

1513
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,560
But I did not have a lot of exposure

1514
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,520
to the characters growing up to the more fun cakes.

1515
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:45,580
That's true.

1516
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:45,940
Yeah.

1517
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,500
They're also, the Cookie Puss is an important part

1518
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,580
of hip hop history in that Cookie Puss

1519
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,720
was the Beastie Boys' first single.

1520
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:53,600
So.

1521
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,280
Oh yeah.

1522
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,120
Don't forget that.

1523
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,420
Oh yeah.

1524
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,860
Also, like Kickstart's an incredible career.

1525
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,180
So I have the utmost respect for Mr.

1526
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:00,580
Puss.

1527
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:01,680
Yes.

1528
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,360
Thank you, Mr.

1529
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:02,600
Puss.

1530
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,740
Thanks for everything.

1531
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,680
Jason, you got anything?

1532
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,740
You don't have to.

1533
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:10,720
I got something if you want me to go.

1534
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go for it.

1535
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,560
Yeah, Mike, you go.

1536
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,360
Yeah, I got a gripe.

1537
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,660
You are dead wrong about the Mickeyverse theory.

1538
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,940
There is only one Mickey Mouse and he is a talented actor

1539
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,500
who plays many roles and occasionally gets a new look

1540
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,480
from hair and makeup.

1541
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,100
This appears, and here's where I think this,

1542
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,100
maybe there's some holes in this person's gripe.

1543
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,020
This appears to be the case in prominent Mickey media

1544
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,940
such as Roger Rabbit and House of Mouse,

1545
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,140
which features Mickey personally introducing

1546
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,400
some of his films for all his Disney friends.

1547
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,360
It pains me to write this gripe as I am a huge Mike head

1548
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,200
and I wish only the best for Mike and his friends.

1549
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,240
Now, I think they're talking about me

1550
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,540
and didn't forget to put a y at the end of each of those.

1551
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:53,600
But.

1552
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:53,860
You?

1553
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,480
I think they're talking about me

1554
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,520
because I guess I'm the one who kind of put that theory

1555
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,800
out there in the first place.

1556
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,940
Also, they say love the grunch.

1557
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,080
They call themselves the grunch.

1558
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,940
I gotta like that.

1559
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,420
I like the grunch, yeah.

1560
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,900
So they're calling me out for what they believe

1561
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,620
is an incorrect theory that there is a multiverse of Mickeys.

1562
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:17,740
I don't know.

1563
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,700
I don't know that this evidence is so clear to me

1564
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,460
because I think that there's a lot of contradictions

1565
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,580
when it comes to sort of what Mickey has done

1566
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,040
and what Mickey's been up to,

1567
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,980
where he lives, what he's done and what his friends do.

1568
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,540
I think it's very flexible,

1569
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,940
which is what leads me to believe there's a Mickey-verse.

1570
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,220
Look, I believe Mickey is a very talented actor

1571
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,000
who plays many roles and occasionally gets a new look.

1572
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,940
Yes, that's true.

1573
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,960
But I think the physics and the reality

1574
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,040
change from cartoon to cartoon,

1575
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,600
which is why I believe these are different universes.

1576
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,940
I don't think Mickey can do the same things

1577
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,520
because you can't see a gross closeup of Mickey's face

1578
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,240
on a classic Disney cartoon like you can now

1579
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:01,980
on the new ones.

1580
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,720
And there's the different voices.

1581
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,680
There's the one that sounds normal

1582
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,120
and there's the one that sounds like shit.

1583
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,620
So what does that tell you?

1584
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,580
Exactly, there's completely different voices.

1585
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,060
Is he changing his voice?

1586
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,320
That doesn't make sense.

1587
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,960
It would be a different character.

1588
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:23,900
Is Mickey in the park?

1589
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,200
Mickey in the parks is a different character

1590
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,800
for sure than Mickey in the cartoons.

1591
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,400
I stand behind that.

1592
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,920
Now, if there is some sort of guidebook official Disney

1593
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,440
source that has this information,

1594
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,300
I'm happy to say that I'm wrong.

1595
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,840
But I'm gonna need to see this documented somewhere

1596
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,580
or I'm gonna have to hear it from somebody who leaked it

1597
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:48,260
when Walt was drunk at the Tamo Shantor one night

1598
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,160
that Mickey is always the same,

1599
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,920
even when he looks different.

1600
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,460
Even when Mickey looks different, he's the same.

1601
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,360
If he said something like that,

1602
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,680
then maybe I will see what you're saying.

1603
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,680
I appreciate your gripe grunch.

1604
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,980
I'm just saying, I'm not convinced.

1605
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,240
I appreciate you being a huge mic head though.

1606
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,940
I don't know that I've ever heard a person that likes me

1607
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,240
say that they were a mic head

1608
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,960
and I can appreciate that branding.

1609
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,460
Do they think the show should be called Mike and Friends

1610
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,180
instead of podcast the ride?

1611
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,620
I mean, I like the sound of it,

1612
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,660
but I don't know if that's what the grunch is saying.

1613
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,400
We could talk about our branding off the air,

1614
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,740
but I mean, like, yeah, everyone thinks

1615
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,240
that's how we should brand the show.

1616
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,880
Just send us another email or send us a gripe.

1617
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,800
I wouldn't agree to that

1618
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,580
before I would agree to this show being called

1619
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,340
The Edge Lord Hour.

1620
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,400
Uh-oh.

1621
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,860
With The Edge Lord and some other people.

1622
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,720
Okay, well, look, I don't know if there's a gripe in here

1623
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,540
saying The Edge Lord should be the branding of the show,

1624
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,160
but I'm open to all of these ideas.

1625
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,100
I'm flexible.

1626
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,040
There's one.

1627
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,220
There's one idea in here that I'm curious

1628
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,960
if you're open to or flexible about.

1629
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,220
Okay, yeah, go ahead.

1630
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,540
I don't know, this one's a little more personal,

1631
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,100
so just buckle up.

1632
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,400
Okay, I'm ready.

1633
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,860
I've got a gripe all right.

1634
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,820
Michael has been living in sin for years.

1635
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:18,920
Well, I'm-

1636
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
I saw this.

1637
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,380
There are certain ones that I avoided being too personal.

1638
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,640
This one has to be read.

1639
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,400
While I'm perfectly fine with this morally,

1640
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,920
it conflicts with his podcast persona.

1641
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,600
You're telling me a sexually repressed character

1642
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,880
who's afraid of bodiness goes to sleep

1643
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,200
with an unmarried woman?

1644
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,880
For the sake of podcast character integrity,

1645
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,180
Michael must move out until he makes

1646
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,540
an honest woman of Lindsay.

1647
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:45,660
Response.

1648
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,580
Okay, look, I would like to say that my characters

1649
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,380
from episode to episode actually exist in a multiverse.

1650
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,180
The microverse.

1651
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,380
So sometimes when you hear me, it's the microverse,

1652
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,100
so sometimes when you hear me curse,

1653
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,960
that's actually a different Earth's Michael.

1654
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,980
And when I'm talking about how Lindsay and I

1655
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,100
are living in sin, that's that other one.

1656
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,300
That's the one who curses.

1657
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,380
Sometimes it happens mid-episode.

1658
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,480
Sometimes it depends.

1659
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,860
Sometimes I'm completely uptight,

1660
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,180
and then obviously like in Europe,

1661
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,980
I just go wild like I'm at Mardi Gras.

1662
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,560
So even that was a multiverse situation.

1663
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,140
That wasn't a permanent character change,

1664
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,800
and that's why you essentially changed back.

1665
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,980
Right, I snapped back, but that's actually

1666
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,480
a different character from a multiverse.

1667
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,740
So I mean, I think it's an interesting,

1668
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,480
if you're a long-time listener,

1669
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,660
I think you can probably start to identify

1670
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,660
the different characters in the microverse,

1671
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,360
which have different qualities,

1672
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,320
and I think there are at least three

1673
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,240
that I can think of.

1674
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,700
Yeah, like radically different mics.

1675
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,160
can't hear anything sexual,

1676
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,220
like stuck at eight years old Mike.

1677
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,780
Thinks that King Kong burping qualifies his body.

1678
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,040
Right, he's like more of like a 19,

1679
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,040
he would fit along with a Jason verse,

1680
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,580
like 1950s little boy character,

1681
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,940
or 1920s little boy character.

1682
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,640
A newsie.

1683
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,460
Like we're just like two little rascals,

1684
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,980
but we're so innocent.

1685
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,740
We have never heard anything bad or a curse word before.

1686
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,560
And then there's obviously,

1687
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,240
there's a one where it's like maybe it's like 11 p.

1688
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,400
m.

1689
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:24,400
,

1690
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,920
and I've had half of a fruit-based cocktail,

1691
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,240
and I'm getting loose, you know?

1692
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,180
I'm saying, I'm not saying seed, I'm saying asshole.

1693
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,860
I'm saying like doing your stuff,

1694
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,040
and that's a different character.

1695
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,640
It's like that bad Spider-Man,

1696
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:43,860
who's the, when Tobey Maguire is bad?

1697
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,620
Oh, Spider-Man three.

1698
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,580
Yeah, the symbiote suit.

1699
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,040
Yeah, but that's just still Spider-Man,

1700
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,000
or does he have a different name?

1701
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,020
I think he is, I don't think they call him

1702
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,600
something different.

1703
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,840
He's sort of, is he influenced by the venom?

1704
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,420
Yeah, the venom suit is starting to turn him.

1705
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,960
Like the venom suits inside him,

1706
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,700
it's starting to turn him,

1707
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,340
and then it jumps to Toifer Grace Eddie Brock.

1708
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,520
Right, and then as far as the,

1709
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,580
just these are off the top of my head.

1710
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,340
I'm sure there's more, and people can identify him.

1711
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,140
The third one I can think of is Mike Ademus.

1712
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,080
Oh, that's right.

1713
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,300
Of course, Mike Ademus.

1714
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,340
Mike Ademus.

1715
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,620
Yeah, so that's what I'm gonna blame

1716
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,500
what you're saying on, what your gripe is about.

1717
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,160
You gotta think about which Mike you're dealing with.

1718
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,000
I've seen wide-eyed Comic-Con, Mike.

1719
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,120
Comic-Con is kind of like energizing to Mike

1720
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,320
in the way that Orlando is energizing to me.

1721
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:35,700
Like- That's a good point.

1722
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,580
Sleeps only a few hours a night,

1723
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,620
but wants to stay out all night is like,

1724
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,620
can I climb over that fence?

1725
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,920
Like, who do we know?

1726
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,740
Who can we lie and say is already in the party?

1727
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:47,800
Who has like-

1728
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,160
That's when I'm willing to, yeah,

1729
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,740
that's when I'm willing to be a little bad boy

1730
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,480
to get into free Comic-Con parties.

1731
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,180
That's right.

1732
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,000
It's like, well, we know the writer of this.

1733
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:56,920
Are they here?

1734
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,920
And- Do we know too?

1735
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,280
Yeah.

1736
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,840
After a year of pandemic and baby,

1737
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,840
energized Scott is dead.

1738
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,500
There is no such thing.

1739
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,700
Ha ha ha!

1740
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:07,300
Ha ha ha!

1741
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:08,260
Ha ha ha!

1742
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:10,560
Maybe some, maybe he'll come back in 12 years.

1743
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,420
There's only one Scott in the Scottverse.

1744
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,000
Yeah.

1745
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,020
One Scottverse.

1746
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,660
There's multiples of us.

1747
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,740
That's right, that's right.

1748
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,420
And he's a nudge lord.

1749
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:21,760
That's right.

1750
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,600
Maybe we do like one more run

1751
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,580
and then we, I think we know the closer.

1752
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,400
Yeah.

1753
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,520
I mean, I have a lot, there's a long one I can-

1754
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,160
I know, I ended up with a long one.

1755
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,500
We don't have time for-

1756
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,660
Yeah, I have a long one too.

1757
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,540
Hey, let's maybe just do a long one.

1758
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:36,980
Yeah.

1759
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,940
Okay, I got one.

1760
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,720
Yeah, I got a gripe all right.

1761
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,000
Gentlemen, big fan, listen to all your collective catalog

1762
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,740
and we'll revisit old episodes during content lulls.

1763
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,060
In an old episode, Jason insulted people

1764
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,420
that got married before 25.

1765
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:57,560
I was fortunate to meet my soulmate and was married at 22.

1766
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,920
We have four wonderful children, all theme park fans,

1767
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,320
and just celebrated our 23rd anniversary.

1768
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,840
I would ask Jason to please consider that love

1769
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,100
isn't constrained by time and can transcend

1770
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:08,920
established norms.

1771
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,760
For whatever reason that comment has stuck with me

1772
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,440
and making this great will allow me to continue

1773
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,900
enjoying the show knowing my voice was heard.

1774
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,240
Thanks, Tom.

1775
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,280
Hey, thanks Tom and very brave of you to sign it.

1776
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,860
Well, I'm sorry that gripe stuck with you.

1777
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,960
I have no recollection of it and I apologize for making it

1778
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,940
because I truly don't feel that strongly about it,

1779
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,720
but I will say in my defense,

1780
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,580
you've been married for 23 years.

1781
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,360
So 23 years ago, I feel like I knew,

1782
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,020
a lot of my older cousins were indeed getting married

1783
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,460
around 25 or older, younger than 25.

1784
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,180
Certainly people out here in Los Angeles,

1785
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,840
get very career focused and sometimes put it off,

1786
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,500
but I don't feel that strongly about it.

1787
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,980
I feel like the reason I may have said it at the time

1788
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,140
was I have known a number of people

1789
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,500
who have gotten married before 25

1790
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,380
and I also have known a good amount of people

1791
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,740
who have married by 25 and divorced a short while later.

1792
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,320
So that might be where I was coming from

1793
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,580
or I just saw something from back from my hometown

1794
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,260
where I was like, oh no, they didn't last, that's sad.

1795
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,520
Have you considered that love can transcend

1796
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,460
while the stuff is supposed to transcend?

1797
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:28,400
I don't remember what he said.

1798
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,060
I can, I do agree.

1799
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:35,080
Yes, I do believe that love can transcend established norms,

1800
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,160
but that is fighting against the human brain.

1801
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,400
At this point, they've figured out the human brain

1802
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,520
is still growing until about 25.

1803
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,700
So I think there with all this stuff, there's a give and take

1804
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,780
and congratulations to you guys on your anniversary.

1805
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:52,860
Hey.

1806
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:53,280
Yeah.

1807
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,300
I will say, I bet there is a case of this a lot

1808
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,560
where we said something in an episode

1809
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,340
and somebody's like, I still remembers it

1810
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,220
and we have no memory of it.

1811
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,740
And it was a very casual joke.

1812
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,220
Yes.

1813
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,600
I'll just blanket apologize.

1814
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,800
I think we're all pretty like goofy about like what we like

1815
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,540
with I'll make fun of stuff I love.

1816
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,980
There's goofy stuff everywhere.

1817
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,580
So if we're making fun of stuff,

1818
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,960
we might just be having fun.

1819
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,140
I think 99% of the time we're having fun.

1820
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:24,740
Yeah.

1821
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,840
So I, you know, well, I'll make fun of journey

1822
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,460
into your imagination, but if I'm at Epcot,

1823
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,960
I'm going on everything.

1824
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,760
Of course.

1825
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,080
Of course.

1826
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:33,900
Of course.

1827
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:35,660
All right.

1828
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,740
This is kind of long.

1829
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,080
Let me see.

1830
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,440
Maybe I'll only read a little part of this.

1831
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,780
This is, this is a, was, had a title to this gripe.

1832
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,040
Whoa.

1833
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,020
Oh.

1834
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,420
Sanrio Laura.

1835
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,760
Oh, this was going to be one of mine.

1836
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,820
So yeah, you can, you can.

1837
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,600
Okay, great.

1838
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,200
All right.

1839
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:48,600
Great.

1840
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,560
This is correcting the record regarding a few things

1841
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,300
brought up in the podcast episode, Scott's Tokyo Top 10

1842
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,380
from April 26th, 2019.

1843
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,640
Around, around, I love this, around two hours

1844
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,840
and nine minutes into the podcast,

1845
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,040
you suggest that Bats Maru,

1846
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,160
I believe it's also right.

1847
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,560
Bats Maru is depicted gambling

1848
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,260
on the Sanrio character boat ride.

1849
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,280
This is incorrect.

1850
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,680
The penguin depicted in the diorama to the right

1851
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,460
when entering the cave section of the ride

1852
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,440
said in the casino is actually Bats Maru's father

1853
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,460
whom is given no name other than Papa.

1854
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,880
You can tell it's Papa and not Bats

1855
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,460
because he is blue instead of black,

1856
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,660
has a cigar and a top hat.

1857
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,120
He also, he also has a mustache above his beak,

1858
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,880
similar to that worn by Charlie Chaplin.

1859
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,300
Ron Male of Sparks

1860
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,440
and a few other notable historical figures.

1861
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,520
Papa is a Yakuza boss with a gambling addiction.

1862
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,180
Papa is also the penguin drinking in the party scene.

1863
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,560
Although official Sanrio materials have depicted

1864
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,880
Bats Maru consuming alcohol as well.

1865
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,180
Accompanying him in the diorama are Panda,

1866
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,560
Pandaba, is that right?

1867
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,800
And Hanamaru, which is a little strange

1868
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,820
since they are supposed to be

1869
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,520
his elementary school classmates.

1870
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:56,300
Pandaba Panda is a tough girl who loves hip hop

1871
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,680
for whom Bats Maru harbors a secret crush.

1872
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,240
Hanamaru Seal is a Bats Maru's friend

1873
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,820
despite being a goody goody tattletale.

1874
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,820
Hanamaru's name refers to a spiral shaped mark

1875
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:10,500
Japanese teachers give when a student is incorrect,

1876
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,900
or is correct, excuse me.

1877
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,920
When Bats Maru is named after the X mark

1878
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,800
for when they are incorrect.

1879
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,200
You mentioned there being a scene of Bats Maru

1880
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,860
spying on a woman in a dressing room.

1881
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,300
This is also false.

1882
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:20,700
Wow.

1883
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,520
The pink character is also a penguin, not a cat.

1884
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,720
She is Bats Maru's,

1885
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,940
and then I wait, hold on, it cut off.

1886
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:27,480
Oh, I have it.

1887
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,960
She is Bats Maru's mother, Mama,

1888
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,680
being teased by a hiding Bats Maru

1889
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,120
and thereby distracted from her exercise.

1890
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,360
You can see him performing the Akanbe in this scene,

1891
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,260
I've said that wrong, I'm sure,

1892
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,140
which is a childish gesture usually made

1893
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,180
to display insolence towards a parent.

1894
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,020
Bats Maru is said to live in gorgeous town USA,

1895
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,400
which is said to be somewhere in Hawaii.

1896
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,900
He said, oh my God, okay, so it goes on.

1897
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,220
At the end of the person says he's also,

1898
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,460
who the designer of Bats Maru is,

1899
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,440
who is also the designer of Hang Yodan the Fish,

1900
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,900
who is one of my favorite personal characters.

1901
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,180
I would love to talk about Hang Yodan as well,

1902
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,720
but fear that I am reaching the end of my allotted time.

1903
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,820
And I just jumped over a bunch.

1904
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,420
This is great, love this.

1905
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,900
There's a couple in the gripes list

1906
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,000
that were incredibly long,

1907
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,360
and sometimes the incredibly long is a sign of,

1908
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,000
a bad one that we don't wanna touch.

1909
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,600
Most of the time, the longer it is, the better it is.

1910
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,520
And in this case, amazing.

1911
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,020
Yeah, there's so much context to go through here.

1912
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,940
But yeah, I thought there was a character

1913
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,520
who's a bad penguin who's shown gambling

1914
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,820
and then getting spanked or spying on a woman changing.

1915
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,380
And apparently in both cases, a parent was involved.

1916
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,240
This was mistaken identity on my part.

1917
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,840
I guess I just don't know the Sanrio world well enough.

1918
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,440
I'd say I certainly don't.

1919
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,820
I loved this ride so much, Sanrio character boat ride.

1920
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,800
There was even, we never did an episode

1921
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,440
about Sanrio Pura Land where Mike also went.

1922
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,180
I think there was talk of,

1923
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,120
my wife Erin maybe wanted to do an episode about it.

1924
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,680
And then I started reading her this and she's like,

1925
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,200
oh, thank God we didn't do an episode

1926
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,220
because I would have been wrong on all of it.

1927
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,100
Me casually liking Sanrio when I was 12

1928
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,700
would just result in me putting my foot in my mouth

1929
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,100
with all this mythology.

1930
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,660
And thanks for taking the time.

1931
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,420
Thanks for correcting the law.

1932
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,200
I'm really curious about all of this.

1933
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,360
It still is a ride that includes spanking and gambling.

1934
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,480
So it's still weird.

1935
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:30,960
It's just maybe weird in different ways than I thought.

1936
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,300
Right.

1937
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,880
Yes, thank you for this.

1938
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,000
This is a great gripe.

1939
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:35,640
Great gripe.

1940
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,780
It's a great gripe.

1941
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,340
It does bring up a gripe for me

1942
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,360
for the Google Forms developers.

1943
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,180
You need, you should have the spreadsheet

1944
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:48,400
this information spits out to automatically wrap text

1945
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,760
in the cells that in the column

1946
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,120
because the spreadsheet looks so insane

1947
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,440
when we first pulled it up.

1948
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,380
They need to upgrade this.

1949
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
Google certainly does.

1950
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,340
I also have a gripe with Google, I agree.

1951
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,560
Yeah, yeah.

1952
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,220
Well, the length thing will become an issue

1953
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,480
I think in the closer.

1954
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,280
I have a really short one before that though,

1955
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:11,120
which is, unless you have more about Sanrio.

1956
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,180
We never taught, we did never do Sanrio.

1957
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,060
I loved Sanrio Pure Land.

1958
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,640
I would love to talk about it.

1959
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,600
We do have to do that.

1960
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,780
That's a huge.

1961
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,040
It was something, that was one of the most delightful days.

1962
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,480
That's one of the last times that Energy Scott

1963
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:29,680
reared his head back in April 2019.

1964
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,420
But here's a really quick one.

1965
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,460
Stop bringing on that unfunny defunct land guy,

1966
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,060
sincerely Kevin P.

1967
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,640
We can only assume that that Kevin P

1968
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,460
is the defunct land guy, and I won't use that word

1969
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,980
that he used.

1970
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,700
I think there was a kerfuffle on our Facebook page

1971
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,340
where somebody was, I don't know if you call it ratioed

1972
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:54,080
on Facebook, but somebody just really took a swing

1973
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,920
that everyone agreed that they don't like Kevin Berger.

1974
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:01,200
And he was, everybody really piled on him,

1975
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,280
which yeah, hey, Kevin's great.

1976
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,520
We have Kevin on whenever.

1977
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,160
Right.

1978
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:13,860
In the groups, on the internet, but also, you know,

1979
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:17,760
guests enter at your own, you know, enter at your own,

1980
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,740
your private Facebook groups where things you've created

1981
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,400
may be discussed.

1982
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:22,880
Oh yeah.

1983
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:23,380
Tread lightly.

1984
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,520
Well, we've learned that in this episode,

1985
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,000
just trading lightly with feedback in general.

1986
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:35,260
really quick, I'm just gonna list these out.

1987
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,640
People did say like topics that they wanna hear,

1988
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,800
and that's a welcome gripe, we'll always take that.

1989
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,320
I'm just gonna say a couple quick ones.

1990
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,960
Yosemite Sam Gold River Adventure at Six Flags Over Texas,

1991
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,800
which is a boat ride with animatronic Looney Tunes.

1992
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,360
Would love to, that sounds great.

1993
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:51,840
That sounds awesome.

1994
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,060
Please always send us ideas

1995
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,380
that you're passionate about.

1996
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,140
Silver Dollar City, for sure.

1997
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,960
Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Carowinds, absolutely.

1998
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,060
These are two that come up a lot lately,

1999
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,400
and maybe there's a good chance to address them.

2000
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,980
Stu Leonard's.

2001
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,860
Stu Leonard's is a grocery chain.

2002
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,760
The one that this guy mentioned is in Yonkers,

2003
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,760
I think there's a bunch of them.

2004
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,760
It's in the northeast of the country.

2005
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,260
It's a grocery chain with a lot of animatronics,

2006
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,460
and probably everybody's thinking,

2007
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,460
well, this is similar to Fry's, like odd amount of theming

2008
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,340
for being just a regular store.

2009
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:29,260
I think we do have to do this, and I wanna go pretty bad,

2010
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,680
and I just don't know if I'm gonna go.

2011
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,420
I don't know if we're gonna end up in like Yonkers, are we?

2012
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,740
Jason, you end up, are you anywhere near a Stu Leonard's

2013
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,020
when you're visiting your folks?

2014
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,060
I don't think so.

2015
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,960
Wait, this isn't the one with the monorail outside?

2016
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,100
That's a different one.

2017
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,760
There's also, I don't know if it's the monorail one,

2018
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,120
there's also Jungle Gyms, which is a similar thing

2019
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,280
that I think is in Ohio.

2020
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,440
I wanna do all of these.

2021
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,300
I just would love to go, but how feasible is it to go?

2022
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:58,820
Obviously not at all right now.

2023
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,960
If you're fine with us doing these topics without going,

2024
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,700
then we'll do it.

2025
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,580
I don't know, are you guys as enthusiastic

2026
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,760
about these animatronic grocery stores as me?

2027
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,540
I'd like to go.

2028
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,300
A couple people have said it to me,

2029
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,920
of like, do you know about Jungle Gyms?

2030
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,320
Like, yes, I think we've talked about Jungle Gyms before.

2031
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:18,740
Maybe briefly.

2032
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:19,480
I think it's come up.

2033
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,660
Maybe with Doug Jones.

2034
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,360
We look into a live, we could look at it,

2035
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,360
we will do a live show again, fingers crossed.

2036
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,600
We can always try to see, oh, we're gonna do it here.

2037
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,820
Maybe it's not too far out of the way.

2038
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,220
Let's look into the locations and see

2039
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,860
if it even seems possible, and then we'll decide,

2040
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,960
oh, maybe we'll just do it.

2041
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,840
Maybe we'll find a guest who has been and we'll see.

2042
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,260
Maybe somebody has to have been on the ground.

2043
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,200
That's a good rule.

2044
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,720
I have a couple that have been sent to me recently

2045
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,980
that I think are, one we could go to at some point

2046
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,220
in the future that's close.

2047
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,480
Fran Comstock sent this to me.

2048
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,700
The Capri Room, there's a buka in Encino that.

2049
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,780
Buca di Beppo?

2050
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,880
Buca di Beppo.

2051
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm just calling it, there's a buca.

2052
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:07,940
We got a buca.

2053
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,440
There's a buca that shows, it becomes a plot point

2054
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,300
in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,

2055
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,720
because one of them invests in this location

2056
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,020
or becomes a part owner of this location,

2057
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,940
and there's a lot of Robert Earl in these episodes

2058
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:28,720
because he is that Real Housewives' son's godfather,

2059
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,960
I think, and that was very funny to discover,

2060
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,940
to learn about.

2061
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:38,380
And the other thing that we have been sent to us

2062
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,660
a few times that I have to go back and watch this,

2063
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,080
because I think I watched it when I was kind of

2064
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,300
falling asleep one night, is the,

2065
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,300
I think it's called the Mouseketeers Go to the Magic Kingdom.

2066
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,860
It's on Disney+.

2067
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,500
Yeah, oh, that's one of those great,

2068
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,280
it's awesome that they started adding stuff like that

2069
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,780
with the commercials.

2070
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:54,720
It's a real TV special.

2071
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,500
Yeah, yeah, sure.

2072
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,820
Love to talk about that.

2073
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,280
The other big one, I've been seeing this a lot lately,

2074
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,760
Casa Bonita, which famous from the South Park episode,

2075
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,300
it's in Denver, I believe.

2076
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:10,060
I watched a video, inspired by that,

2077
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,020
I watched a video all about Casa Bonita.

2078
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,660
It looks like it rules.

2079
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,240
The people who work there seem great.

2080
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,300
I hope they're doing okay in the pandemic.

2081
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,700
I'm concerned about it.

2082
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,280
That one, I feel like I can't,

2083
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,340
I have to go to Casa Bonita in person.

2084
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,800
And if you don't know what we're talking about,

2085
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,720
this like amazing restaurant with gliff divers,

2086
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,840
it's just some of,

2087
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,480
I think it's my literal favorite South Park.

2088
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,840
It's just such joy from Cartman,

2089
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,340
who does horrible things to get to go there.

2090
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,420
But cliff divers in Black Brides Cave,

2091
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,060
and would love to do Casa Bonita.

2092
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,280
I've just been seeing it enough,

2093
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,960
I wanna say we're not ignoring this request.

2094
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,920
Right, yeah, no, I would like to go as well.

2095
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,640
It's obviously, it's more themed,

2096
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,360
but it's almost like there's some elements of it

2097
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,340
that remind me of Clifton's Downtown LA.

2098
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,180
Yes.

2099
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,840
Which is probably an episode,

2100
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,000
if you've been there before.

2101
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,400
Clifton's great.

2102
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,420
Walt loved it.

2103
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,340
Walt loved it.

2104
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:06,760
Yeah.

2105
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,080
They refurbed it a few, what, years ago at this point?

2106
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,480
Yeah, yeah, it's really great.

2107
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:11,380
Yeah.

2108
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,840
Yeah, well anyway, I would love to do all that.

2109
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,740
Hopefully do it in person, but else I gotta,

2110
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:15,720
boy, there's a lot of,

2111
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,020
I'm gonna go broke with travel after this apparently.

2112
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,080
Well, do we close with the big one?

2113
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,540
And also, how much can we possibly do?

2114
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,580
I'm already ashamed.

2115
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,840
I feel like most of it, by the way, is reading it.

2116
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,280
I'm embracing myself.

2117
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,960
But I think it's the reading more than the answering,

2118
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,800
although you guys tell me,

2119
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:40,600
because you're on the hook more than I am, obviously.

2120
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,880
Do we spread this out like a,

2121
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,200
do we assign each other parts, like a table read?

2122
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,680
Do you all have it?

2123
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,620
Oh, that's a good question, yeah, yeah.

2124
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:50,940
Let me look.

2125
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,060
Yeah, let me get in front of me.

2126
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:55,100
Do you need me to send it to you if?

2127
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,740
Oh yeah, maybe let's do that.

2128
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,760
I have it here, but maybe I'm gonna make sure

2129
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:01,020
I have all of it, because apparently it wasn't copying well

2130
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,300
from those Google Docs.

2131
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,480
Damn Google Docs.

2132
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,180
I could put it in the chat also.

2133
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,820
Maybe that's the way.

2134
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:07,700
Yeah, throw it in the chat.

2135
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,480
That's how much, this is quite a tome

2136
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,820
that we're dealing with.

2137
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,080
Which is not much better,

2138
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,020
which is also not the chat feature on Zoom.

2139
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,340
No, it's not, it's not letting me copy it even.

2140
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,000
Too long.

2141
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,420
Here, maybe, here's what we'll do.

2142
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,180
Oh, I can't copy this either.

2143
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,160
Yeah, I got it in front of me.

2144
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,060
Mike, see if you can find it.

2145
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,400
I'll read up through point one.

2146
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,260
Jason, you take over at point two,

2147
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,540
and Mike, if you can get to it by point three.

2148
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:36,500
All right, here we go.

2149
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,580
Yeah, I've got a gripe regarding the Lucy attribute episode,

2150
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,800
and it's about the myriad of factual errors

2151
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,360
presented present in this recording,

2152
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,600
as well as the lack of apology for spreading such falsehoods.

2153
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,260
Scott, you're excused from this,

2154
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,380
because you knew barely anything throughout this whole episode.

2155
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,360
Ah, phew.

2156
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,960
My expectations for you were low here, and rightfully so.

2157
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,500
These righteous complaints are unfortunately only

2158
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,320
for Mike and Jason, who billed themselves

2159
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,160
as the I Love Lucy experts of the podcast.

2160
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,400
This, by the way, is the understood the assignment gripe.

2161
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,320
Mike stated within the episode

2162
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,820
that his mom would have the most corrections for this episode,

2163
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,900
so I'm sure she already lectured you boys at length

2164
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,900
about these mistakes.

2165
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,220
Nonetheless, I feel compelled to address them again,

2166
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,000
and I'm sure Mike's mom would agree

2167
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,020
that these need to be addressed on air.

2168
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,280
Thank you in advance to Ms.

2169
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,720
Carlson for taking my side.

2170
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Mike, Jason, you said you'd apologize via YouTube

2171
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,480
and issue retractions to the false facts in this episode,

2172
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,420
but I've yet to see anything of the sort.

2173
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,280
Well, I don't think they knew, and now they will.

2174
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,900
With that said, this person's grievances are as follows.

2175
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,760
Number one, approximately 15 minutes into the episode,

2176
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,040
Mike says he knows the longest studio laugh break in history,

2177
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,220
which is when Lucy is secretly holding eggs

2178
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,220
and they get crushed.

2179
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,800
Mike falsely identifies this as taking place

2180
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,520
in a Lucy-Desi comedy hour.

2181
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,140
Michael, he means business because he uses the full Michael.

2182
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,840
This was in a regular 30-minute I Love Lucy episode

2183
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,660
in the Connecticut season, and they're not in her apron.

2184
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,880
They're hidden in her shirt because they're trying

2185
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,820
to sneak eggs out to the chicken coops

2186
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:09,840
to make Ricky and Fred think the hens started laying eggs.

2187
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,020
Deep down, you know this, I know this,

2188
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,560
your mom surely knows this.

2189
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,040
Jason then goes on to say,

2190
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,580
and then someone gives her a bear hug or something,

2191
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,280
and while I'm disappointed in Jason

2192
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,720
for getting this fact wrong, I'm more disappointed in Mike.

2193
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,900
Oh my God, for not correcting him

2194
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,780
as he brought up this scene in the first place.

2195
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,380
The eggs are broken when Ricky asks Lucy

2196
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,740
to practice their tango for the PTA show,

2197
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,980
and she spins into him, crushing all the eggs

2198
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,360
in one of the most iconic scenes in comedy history.

2199
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
Mike then says, I did not relook this up,

2200
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,640
it's just something I have in my mind, my memory.

2201
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,740
It doesn't seem like you do, Michael.

2202
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:52,380
Well, I did partially in there.

2203
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,040
It was partially in there.

2204
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,220
Intermission, do you wanna address anything

2205
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,020
in the before we move on?

2206
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:02,160
I mean, look, this person is 100% correct.

2207
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,020
It was not a Lucy Desi comedy hour, which they made,

2208
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,400
and I'm about to say more facts, and now I'm just,

2209
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,300
I'm gun shy here as far as, I was gonna say they made

2210
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,920
like nine Lucy Desi comedy hours,

2211
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,340
which are longer than the Lucy,

2212
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,320
than the I Love Lucy episodes.

2213
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,280
I think that's right, I apologize ahead of time

2214
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:21,960
if I'm wrong.

2215
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,400
I do remember the tango, I do remember that is 100% correct,

2216
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,940
there's nothing I need to correct here, I can't clap back.

2217
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,140
All I have to say is that I apologize,

2218
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,020
and I'm gonna be saying it a lot.

2219
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,880
I'm gonna be saying a lot during this one.

2220
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,660
Mike, I don't believe, I'm pretty sure

2221
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,820
you don't have daughters.

2222
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,060
If you do and I don't know about it,

2223
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,800
feel free to blame them in a Ted Cruz-esque manner.

2224
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,680
Your daughters were distracting you

2225
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,160
from having proper I Love Lucy knowledge.

2226
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:54,040
I won't use the excuse yet, I think when we get

2227
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:57,200
even into worse things that Jason and I possibly did

2228
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,440
or said about Lucy and Lucy history,

2229
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,380
that I might blame some anonymous daughters, yes.

2230
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,260
Jason part two?

2231
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,680
I'll use this intermission to do a real quick gripe

2232
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,140
within a gripe, because I see right under it

2233
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,440
the spreadsheet I'm looking at, it says,

2234
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,440
how the hell could you not have Griffin Newman

2235
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,380
on a Fast and Furious episode,

2236
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,740
that's a podcast felony in my book, boyos.

2237
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:22,540
I thought the same thing, but then when we last talked

2238
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,840
to him, he said he had not written Fast and Furious

2239
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,340
Supercharged in Orlando, so I did not think it was,

2240
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:33,380
you know, quite right to have him on the episode,

2241
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:36,820
but I'm sure once he gets back to visiting Orlando

2242
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:40,640
like the rest of us, he will give us his full opinion.

2243
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,660
Seems like a perfect time for a full redo episode.

2244
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,580
It seems like it, that's how we roll.

2245
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,620
More of that, oh man.

2246
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,300
That's right.

2247
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:49,960
We roll like this.

2248
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,560
All right, we'll discuss that later, part two.

2249
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,040
Part two, is this me taking over?

2250
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:57,120
Yeah.

2251
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:02,000
Okay, this is the bullet point number two.

2252
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,120
I don't know, it starts with later in the episode,

2253
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,440
Jason, Ike.

2254
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,040
Yeah, I see it.

2255
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,440
Here, let me just make sure I can see all of it.

2256
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,120
Again, ashamed, shame.

2257
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,820
Let's see.

2258
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,840
I can do it if you want.

2259
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,120
Oh my gosh.

2260
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:19,740
Okay.

2261
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,740
Yeah, here, switch.

2262
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,660
Okay, later in the episode, Jason says that at some point,

2263
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,300
Fred and Ricky went into an egg business together,

2264
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,860
and it's casually mentioned that Fred is now the manager

2265
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:31,680
of Ricky's band.

2266
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:35,740
Jason, Fred was Ricky's manager throughout the entire

2267
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:37,380
Europe vacation season.

2268
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,780
That's why the Mertzes got to tag along.

2269
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,880
That's why Ricky tried to fire Fred when the band ended up

2270
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,320
in the wrong town in Switzerland,

2271
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,380
leading the gang to having free time

2272
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,660
to go hiking in the Alps.

2273
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,340
This was not a casual mention,

2274
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,480
this was a full blown plot point.

2275
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,980
And at some point, they went into an egg business together.

2276
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,780
Jason, they dedicated at least two whole episodes

2277
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,500
to the chickens right at the beginning

2278
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,700
of the Connecticut season.

2279
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,260
One of these being the egg tango episode

2280
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:06,620
that was previously addressed.

2281
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,440
It was thoroughly explained.

2282
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:11,280
It seems to me that you need to rewatch

2283
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,460
the Connecticut season,

2284
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,960
because the errors here are astounding.

2285
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
That's quite a punishment, Jason.

2286
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,440
I'm sorry, but the man has spoken.

2287
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:21,620
Well, there's a little more for me though.

2288
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,260
Oh yes, yes.

2289
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:22,980
Okay.

2290
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,220
Furthermore, Mike then expressed confusion

2291
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,120
over the Connecticut plot point of Fred and Ethel

2292
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,160
leaving New York and didn't know that Fred had

2293
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:29,560
Mrs.

2294
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,360
Trumbull's sister manage the apartment building

2295
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,760
after they moved.

2296
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,440
Though to Mike's credit,

2297
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:37,980
he did apologize for not knowing this.

2298
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,100
I can appreciate the courage it took

2299
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,420
to admit he didn't know this crucial fact

2300
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,640
about a beloved character, Mrs.

2301
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,840
Trumbull's sister.

2302
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,280
From Jason, no apology.

2303
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,300
Wow.

2304
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:55,080
Well, I'll start off by saying I'm sorry for that.

2305
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,240
I think you have to say what you're sorry for,

2306
01:30:59,260 --> 01:30:59,980
because I got lost.

2307
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:00,720
What's the specific?

2308
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,980
I'm sorry for, oh God.

2309
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,960
Yeah, what is the specific?

2310
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:05,880
All right, all right.

2311
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,640
You're supposed to apologize for not knowing

2312
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:12,100
that Fred managed Ricky's band for a long time,

2313
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:14,280
that it was a main plot point.

2314
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,320
Wait, it's Mrs.

2315
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,100
Trumbull's sister is what he wants.

2316
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,120
Yeah.

2317
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:18,760
Well, that's for me.

2318
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,020
That was more for me.

2319
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:20,440
Oh, okay.

2320
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,760
But I apologize for not knowing ahead of time,

2321
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,040
so I'm in the clear on this paragraph.

2322
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,060
I will apologize and say it's very possible

2323
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:32,640
I was doing an allusion to the creative

2324
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,020
energy of the Connecticut seasons

2325
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,440
when everyone was checked out.

2326
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,220
And I also haven't checked out.

2327
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:42,360
Well, this isn't gonna help.

2328
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,220
Now you're dissing the Connecticut season.

2329
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,280
No, no, no, no.

2330
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,680
Jason, you're making great this worse.

2331
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,040
We're gonna get four, five, and six next round of grapes.

2332
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:54,880
Oh no.

2333
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:58,680
All the I Love Lucy people were just done with each other

2334
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,560
by the time they're like,

2335
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,380
I guess we're in Connecticut now.

2336
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:02,960
I'm sorry.

2337
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,680
You know, it's, it's sometimes they say stuff

2338
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,160
very offhandedly in those shows to, you know,

2339
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,440
rejigger people's memory.

2340
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,520
And some of them made very far apart.

2341
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,500
I think you're making too many excuses.

2342
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:15,860
All right, I'm sorry.

2343
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,100
I dropped the ball on the Connecticut season specifics

2344
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:24,440
and also the European outing specifics, okay?

2345
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,940
I will, look, they weren't calling on an apology,

2346
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:30,840
but I will apologize for not remembering

2347
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:31,820
Mrs.

2348
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:36,120
Trumbull's sister, a character that I am now

2349
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,320
immediately who's been refreshed in my brain,

2350
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,400
a big fan of Mrs.

2351
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:40,220
Trumbull's sister.

2352
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,760
Now I was about to say,

2353
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,680
did we ever see Mrs.

2354
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:43,280
Trumbull's sister?

2355
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,300
I don't remember.

2356
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:47,260
And this might be opening me up to a future paragraph

2357
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,260
of complaints that there will, yes, of course,

2358
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,440
we saw multiple episodes about Mrs.

2359
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,040
Trumbull's sister,

2360
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,240
but I don't know.

2361
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,900
So I apologize.

2362
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,560
There is one more little chunk.

2363
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,260
Jason, do you want to take it?

2364
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:58,860
Do you have it or?

2365
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:00,100
I have it if Jason doesn't have it.

2366
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,100
Yeah, Mike, you read it,

2367
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,860
because I think mine got cut off somehow.

2368
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:03,860
I'm having a tough time.

2369
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,320
Okay, and finally, number three,

2370
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:10,560
Jason says that Ricky sings the theme song,

2371
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:14,800
title of Lucy, when Lucy tells Ricky she's Spectin.

2372
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:18,340
That's a different episode, a birthday episode.

2373
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,100
In the pregnancy episode,

2374
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,280
Ricky sings the classic song,

2375
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,300
we're having a baby, my baby and me.

2376
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,660
The lyrics to the I Love Lucy theme

2377
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,480
are not at all about how Lucy is expecting.

2378
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,460
It would be entirely out of place here.

2379
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,720
And now the sum up.

2380
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,880
Boys, it's hard to be mad at you about these errors.

2381
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:40,880
You love William Frawley as I do.

2382
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,000
We come from the same world, you and I,

2383
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,320
but when a man's wrong, he's wrong and he should say so.

2384
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,420
Am I a crazy person with an encyclopedic knowledge

2385
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,640
of I Love Lucy episodes?

2386
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,760
Yes, yes, we'll say yes.

2387
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:53,700
I know that.

2388
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,340
Do I expect everyone to have

2389
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:56,680
the same knowledge level as me?

2390
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,780
Of course not.

2391
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,680
I know I stand above the rest, alone in my craziness,

2392
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:04,620
but Mike and Jason, I did expect you to rise to this occasion,

2393
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,660
to rise to the tribute.

2394
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,080
To the co?

2395
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:12,460
Please apologize, to me, to Mike's mom, to the world.

2396
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,980
This hurts, folks.

2397
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,060
Boy, this was the dark mirror that you were worried about

2398
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,980
staring into when we proposed this.

2399
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,920
You did it to yourself, Mike, Michael,

2400
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,620
the full series name.

2401
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:26,980
You know what?

2402
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:30,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to you.

2403
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:34,640
The song, I think I remembered when I got in my car

2404
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:39,100
and immediately felt like, oh my God, I hate, God damn it.

2405
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,780
But I appreciate that you came to us

2406
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,820
and that you looked me right in the eye,

2407
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:49,320
when you did it, when you plunged the knife in,

2408
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:54,020
looked me right in the eye and made me feel a fool,

2409
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:56,080
as opposed to the Muppet people

2410
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,040
who will snipe me from a clock tower.

2411
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,940
Oh God, oh yeah, yeah, don't.

2412
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,920
We gotta search through Muppet stuff in these grapes.

2413
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:04,980
We're in a lot of trouble.

2414
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,080
filter out Muppet.

2415
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:16,120
I will, again, formally apologize to this anonymous griper,

2416
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,420
to my mother, to the world.

2417
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,360
For the things I was inaccurate about

2418
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,540
the difference between Lucy Desi Comedy Hour

2419
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:31,280
and the regular I Love Lucy show, Connecticut Seasons.

2420
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,940
So I deeply apologize.

2421
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,280
I will try to watch more I Love Lucy

2422
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,540
to make sure all of this stuff

2423
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,360
is a little bit fresher in my mind.

2424
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,460
And yes, you, whoever you are,

2425
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,880
I think that we have a lot in common

2426
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,700
when it comes to William Frawley.

2427
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,880
And I would like to just say

2428
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:54,020
that I will listen to William Frawley's album tonight.

2429
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,040
Sings the old ones.

2430
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,880
Bill Frawley Sings the Old Ones.

2431
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,840
I think that's the name of it.

2432
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:03,480
If it's not, I apologize again ahead of it.

2433
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,800
And I would like also commend you

2434
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,100
for my favorite gripe on this list.

2435
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,360
Yeah, you nailed it.

2436
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,800
Person one, he won, but also,

2437
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,360
I think you guys nailed the art of the apology.

2438
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,360
There's a lot of talk of people not nailing the apology.

2439
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,160
And I think you manned up and you did it.

2440
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:27,020
You acknowledged many of the specific bullet points.

2441
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,000
And this was a lot easier for me

2442
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,220
who was let off the hook hours ago into this gripe.

2443
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,920
I just really got to sit back and relax.

2444
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,880
So thank you also to this person

2445
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,620
for expecting nothing from me.

2446
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,240
Yes, here's what I'd like to say.

2447
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,600
I'd like to make Jason feel better at the end of the show

2448
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,440
by revealing a piece of information

2449
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,860
unrelated to gripes that I think will make him feel better.

2450
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:54,140
I'm not worried about myself.

2451
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,120
I'm very selfless.

2452
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,480
But Jason, I would like to say,

2453
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,960
and this has been a real roller coaster of information,

2454
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,360
but I have been given recently some information

2455
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,180
about the Jim Belushi story you told.

2456
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:08,060
Oh.

2457
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,680
Now we believed this to be an incorrect story

2458
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,440
because we heard it was actually about the show Cougar Town.

2459
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:19,960
I am now being told that both stories are correct.

2460
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:20,460
Whoa.

2461
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,780
Oh my gosh.

2462
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:25,400
And that your Jim Belushi story about angry crew members

2463
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,040
throwing DVDs into his car is accurate as well.

2464
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:33,400
The source was initially confused has confirmed

2465
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:38,340
that both incidents, possibly one inspired by the other,

2466
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:39,160
happened.

2467
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,600
So you were correct.

2468
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:45,460
Whoa.

2469
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:47,800
On a positive note, you were correct.

2470
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:48,780
Oh, wow.

2471
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,900
About your Jim Belushi story.

2472
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:55,100
So we have come full circle here and you were correct.

2473
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,260
I wanted to make you feel better.

2474
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,580
Jason wins in multiple ways.

2475
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,220
And the big message, if you're making a movie,

2476
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,240
you're making a TV show, you always be nice to the crew.

2477
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,160
That's right.

2478
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,800
You always be nice to the crew.

2479
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,260
You make sure they first,

2480
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:11,180
you say thank you on the way out.

2481
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,440
Always be nice to the crew.

2482
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:12,820
Yeah.

2483
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,300
That's right.

2484
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,780
That's why we're nice to,

2485
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,640
we have to be especially nice to Mike,

2486
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,440
who counts as the crew of this

2487
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,380
because he edits some of them.

2488
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:23,580
That's true.

2489
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:24,480
I could add, you know what?

2490
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,080
I could really, I could cut up you guys saying stuff

2491
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,400
and really make it sound bad.

2492
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,260
I could cut up that I Love Lucy episode

2493
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,460
and make Jason's facts even more wrong.

2494
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:34,120
Oh.

2495
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,100
And if you.

2496
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,400
I could just insert like the name Frank Nelson

2497
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,600
in a spot where he said Gail Gordon

2498
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,860
and then it would make you sound so foolish.

2499
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:44,600
No.

2500
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:45,840
And if you were.

2501
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,620
I just got my emotions under control.

2502
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,880
If you were really mad about anything that we had done,

2503
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:54,780
you could take, really to either of us,

2504
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:56,480
Jason just gave us a Trump Plaza,

2505
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,060
a deck of playing cards that's still on the desk.

2506
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,080
You could take each playing card

2507
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,920
and slide it into our car until our car was full

2508
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,140
and that would send a message.

2509
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,660
But you don't do that.

2510
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,420
So thank you, you get to eat first.

2511
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,400
When we're done here.

2512
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:11,820
All right, thank you.

2513
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,480
In our separate places of recording, you eat before us.

2514
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:16,480
Thank you, yeah.

2515
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,680
All right, good, thank you.

2516
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:23,120
And I guess with that, we should wrap up the group.

2517
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,600
We'll just stand down for now.

2518
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,220
You know, not so bad.

2519
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,900
Well, that's easy for me to say

2520
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,680
because I got taken off the hook at the beginning of that.

2521
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,680
But do you, this wasn't, I think,

2522
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,260
I think this was fine.

2523
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:37,660
I think that it, I think we let people know

2524
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:40,140
kind of what we're looking for in a gripe.

2525
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,600
And I don't know, I guess keep them,

2526
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:44,960
do we wanna leave it open

2527
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,560
or do we wanna bury the gripe box?

2528
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:49,600
Should we make a, well, maybe let's just make a,

2529
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,960
if we do it again, maybe let's make a whole new form

2530
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,980
so we can clear this.

2531
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:54,500
Get this our fresh.

2532
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:58,300
Let's make it like a cute Earth, like Valentine wishes.

2533
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,140
Yeah.

2534
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,860
I said your little wishes to podcast the ride.

2535
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:02,480
And.

2536
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:02,860
Hey.

2537
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:06,740
Put your name and social security number for the FBI.

2538
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:10,700
Well.

2539
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,800
Send Amazon wish list for podcast the ride.

2540
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,660
Wait, no, the wait, they're sending us their Amazon?

2541
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:21,240
We're making a wish list that they can.

2542
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,500
Yeah, we make a wish list.

2543
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:23,880
Oh, well, I like that.

2544
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,400
Yeah.

2545
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:26,500
So now they gotta give us presents

2546
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,720
instead of gripes to make things even.

2547
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:30,720
Well, yeah, I'm just saying,

2548
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,180
these are ideas I'm floating.

2549
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:34,640
I don't think we have to decide on anything right now.

2550
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,340
Hey, you guys are the ones

2551
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:37,080
who are all about doing topics again.

2552
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:40,080
Why doesn't gripes count as one of those?

2553
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:42,960
Don't you think that we've exhausted gripes for now?

2554
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:46,500
It just feels like we've really gotten to the meat of it.

2555
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,440
And it's like, what are we really gonna even say

2556
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,320
on the second one?

2557
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,620
What is even there left to say?

2558
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,460
Well, for now, yes.

2559
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:56,140
You survived podcast the ride, McGrew edition.

2560
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:57,660
I don't know.

2561
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,280
We will, obviously the form will be there if you find it.

2562
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,000
Will we ever open the box again

2563
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,920
or will it be put up in an infinite room of shelves

2564
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:09,560
like the Ark of the Covenant may be?

2565
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,480
That remains to be seen.

2566
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,620
We hope you enjoyed it at least.

2567
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,880
We got a lot of really important stuff straight

2568
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,240
and that's the important thing.

2569
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:20,760
Yes.

2570
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,260
And as always, thank you for listening.

2571
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,660
That's what's important.

2572
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,220
And thank you for your support.

2573
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,040
Absolutely.

2574
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,900
And we say that now,

2575
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,920
especially that we're more scared of you.

2576
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:33,260
That's right.

2577
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:34,620
Humboldt.

2578
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,740
All right, on that note, McGrew out.
