1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:25,336
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Podcast the Ride,

3
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,176
the second gate, historic moment,

4
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,496
the show hosted by three guys who know two hours a week

5
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:34,556
just isn't enough.

6
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,676
Those guys are me, Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson,

7
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:39,016
and Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:41,056
Hey fellas, we made it.

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,336
We have landed at a, it's a historic opening day.

10
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:47,136
And I just wanna say this,

11
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:51,536
to all who come behind this paywall, welcome.

12
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:54,936
Podcast the Ride, the second gate is dedicated

13
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,036
to the dreamers, the optimists,

14
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,256
the people willing to pay for an hour of rambling

15
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:01,336
about Edwin.

16
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:05,356
May it be a source of time wasting or distraction

17
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,476
during a jog or commute for all the world,

18
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:12,696
dedicated by Scott, Mike, and Jason, October 2018.

19
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,516
Do you feel the magic in the air,

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,696
this historic opening day?

21
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,336
That's beautiful and I also like in that,

22
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,496
that's obviously gonna be a plaque.

23
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,256
They'll put that on various merchandise.

24
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:26,696
Only the people who subscribe to the Patreon

25
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:29,676
will be given access to be able to buy the plaque.

26
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:37,816
I was, look, the gold itself will cost about $10,000.

27
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,476
So we're gonna have to mark it up.

28
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,036
I like that it's also a tease to the Edwin episode.

29
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,056
There's a very specific.

30
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:45,516
I figured I'd plant that flag now.

31
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,916
That's, look, we have a ton of fun ideas for this,

32
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:53,576
for the tried and true people who are down

33
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:54,716
to hear more stuff.

34
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,716
That's one of them.

35
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,916
We wanna talk about all these crazy weirdos

36
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,496
who we like who are part of old Disney rides

37
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:04,776
and attractions and films, your thorough Ravenscrofts

38
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:05,576
and what have you.

39
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,036
Mike, as you've alluded to, we wanna pay tribute

40
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:10,616
for longer stretches of time to some

41
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,616
of our favorite animatronics.

42
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,916
Our favorite alien animatronics.

43
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:18,216
You might hear us over here talking about a guy

44
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:19,496
named Botanicus.

45
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:23,136
I bet old Sonny Eclipse will be discussed

46
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,976
in the near future as well.

47
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:27,936
What's really great is that a lot of these animatronics,

48
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:30,256
not Botanicus, Botanicus has a rich backstory,

49
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:32,696
but many of their animatronics will do an hour on,

50
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:33,936
have no backstory.

51
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,956
There's nothing to talk about other than pictures

52
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,256
and maybe the songs that they sing in a restaurant.

53
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,436
Because we have thought about these things

54
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,136
for longer than the people who invented them,

55
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:45,536
who invented the mythology.

56
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:49,016
Because often this was some author or copywriter

57
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,236
who was just like, I don't know, scribble something down.

58
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:55,176
But the tossed off nature of the mythology

59
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,176
that it's half committed to, I think,

60
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,516
is what makes it so fun.

61
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:03,376
Like how a little of a shred of any actual info

62
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:04,176
we have to go off of.

63
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:05,516
You gotta use your imagination.

64
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:06,636
Fill in the blanks.

65
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:07,676
That's the fun of it.

66
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:09,416
And anything, anything.

67
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,836
And because we're taking the time and thinking about it,

68
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,916
you know, why can't what we say be canon?

69
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:16,836
I say it is canon.

70
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:17,856
It is now.

71
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:18,316
Sure.

72
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:20,136
A lot of canon will be made here.

73
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:21,816
All podcasts are canon.

74
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,196
We're building a whole new universe of mythology.

75
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,416
All of us together.

76
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:32,476
That is, that's a thing we've talked about off mic before

77
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,776
that every now and then someone will go like,

78
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,556
oh, you gotta have this person on.

79
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,796
I bet they're gonna have this person on for this topic.

80
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:41,636
And we're like, we didn't know that person

81
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:43,656
is obsessed with X topic.

82
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:46,756
We just know them as a person we know.

83
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:47,576
Or don't know.

84
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:48,696
Or possibly don't know.

85
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:51,256
That's a funny thing because we have had some guests

86
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:54,076
who are on a bunch of other podcasts.

87
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,396
So we are plugged into some of the podcast

88
00:03:57,396 --> 00:04:00,616
industrial network, but complex rather.

89
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:02,036
That's what I meant to say.

90
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,236
Podcast industrial complex.

91
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,656
That's the name of the mythology.

92
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:08,136
But there's a lot of folks we don't know.

93
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:09,516
Sure.

94
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,396
A podcast elder statesman.

95
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,356
And that's the thing we need your help on.

96
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,416
If you're a frequent podcast listener

97
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,476
and we have failed to have a guest on

98
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:19,616
who has asserted themselves on some podcasts

99
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,776
we've never heard as a big theme park guy

100
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:24,336
or even a slight theme park guy, let us know.

101
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:26,336
We'll try to get to hold of them.

102
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:29,096
That's a bold claim that we're gonna do that.

103
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,916
That seems like a little- Also, you're really opening

104
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,616
the floodgates.

105
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:32,936
That was not my intent.

106
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:34,176
I'm not saying that.

107
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,876
Yeah, Joe, we're gonna end up with Terry Gross.

108
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:37,816
If she ever said- Well, that's fine.

109
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,576
If she enjoyed a ride or something.

110
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:42,816
That would be a coup if we got Terry Gross.

111
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:43,936
It certainly would.

112
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,396
But I wouldn't feel comfortable making the ask

113
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:52,316
unless in some deep, fresh air she referred to enjoying,

114
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:55,716
I don't know, the-

115
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:56,856
Tilt-a-whirl.

116
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,036
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,796
The primeval tilt-a-whirl.

118
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:02,496
I'm just saying like just a regular tilt-a-whirl.

119
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:03,716
Just any tilt-a-whirl.

120
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,536
And she'll come on to talk about the tilt-a-whirl.

121
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:07,016
Because she seems like she might not like

122
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,096
the corporate stuff as much,

123
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:13,016
but she loves an old-fashioned fare or something like that.

124
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,316
And then she just kind of quietly speaks

125
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,436
about the tilt-a-whirl and what fun it was.

126
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:18,916
If we could do- Spinning around and round.

127
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:21,556
If we could do tilt-a-whirl, the episode tilt-a-whirls.

128
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:22,836
That actually is a very gross.

129
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,136
That is a pretty good idea.

130
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,656
But we're making a lot of leaps to say

131
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,156
that that could happen.

132
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:28,516
But oh, but maybe I shouldn't say that.

133
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,056
Maybe I should just be confident and commit.

134
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:33,456
With your Patreon pledges, you make it more possible

135
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,776
every day that we will do the episode

136
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,076
tilt-a-whirls with Terry Gross.

137
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,096
That's a podcast, The Right Promise.

138
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,356
Which is to say made up.

139
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:46,676
Here's something we, this is a type of episode

140
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:50,696
that I'd like to propose and talk about a little bit.

141
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,656
This is something I wanna do within the Patreon.

142
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:55,356
A type of episode called Lost and Found.

143
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:56,776
I've talked to you about this,

144
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,396
you guys about this a little bit.

145
00:05:58,596 --> 00:05:59,476
But here's what I'm thinking.

146
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,656
Every, I want by the end of this whole podcast,

147
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:05,976
The Right Journey, that we have covered every square inch

148
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,956
of anything that is currently or has ever been

149
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,176
at a theme park.

150
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:12,756
And we've talked about a lot so far.

151
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:16,596
But I do feel things have slipped through the cracks.

152
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,776
Even in attractions and places that we have covered.

153
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:24,616
And that is why in a Lost and Found episode,

154
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:27,536
I want the listeners to write us and say,

155
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,216
is there a topic or a ride that we've covered already

156
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,916
that we missed something big about?

157
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:37,276
If there was a coaster at Kennywood or a slide

158
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,356
at Schlitterbahn or if you just think we didn't

159
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,776
spend enough time talking about,

160
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:45,956
if there's a Dilophosaurus you're really fond of

161
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:48,056
on the Jurassic Park ride or something,

162
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,156
please just write us and let us know.

163
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:52,716
Podcasts are at a Gmail with the subject line,

164
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:53,776
Lost and Found.

165
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,776
But what I'm proposing basically is just

166
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:00,476
revisiting prior topics to make sure we covered

167
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:04,016
every inch of it, got it all totally covered.

168
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:06,896
Here's an example of the kind of thing.

169
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,636
We just finished the City Walk saga.

170
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,516
And during the City Walk saga, it was too late

171
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,276
to address this because we'd recorded all of them.

172
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,736
But somebody wrote us on Twitter to let us know

173
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:20,716
that several episodes of the television series Sliders

174
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:23,176
had been shot at City Walk.

175
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,476
And they gave us the episode names and descriptions

176
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:30,356
and stills and they used the universal starway

177
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:33,216
to as a, the starway played in the episode,

178
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,576
the big escalators universal, they played as like

179
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,836
escalators going all the way up to the sky

180
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:43,496
to a cloud mall in the sky, which City Walk stood in for.

181
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,496
They used the Jody Maroney's.

182
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:46,956
This was all news to me.

183
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:49,116
I didn't know about any of this and we couldn't cover it

184
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:49,656
in the saga.

185
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,996
That's the kind of thing we can talk about

186
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,256
in the Lost and Found.

187
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,376
But we need you, the audience, to let us know what we lost.

188
00:07:56,536 --> 00:08:00,016
Someone sent us a report that they had seen Prince perform

189
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:01,016
at City Walk.

190
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:03,516
We obviously didn't know that happened.

191
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,996
So like that, we would have talked about that for an hour.

192
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,756
That's exactly the kind of thing.

193
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,436
So anything like that, that's been,

194
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:11,856
if this has been burning a hole in your brain,

195
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:16,036
they talked about Knott's Berry Farm, but they missed when.

196
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,496
Well, we missed a lot of Knott's.

197
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,816
Oh yeah, yeah, no, that would not.

198
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,196
I'm sure like that we covered it all in a single episode.

199
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,456
Nine more Knott's episodes.

200
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:25,596
But if you're aware that there was like a,

201
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:28,956
who was like a super conservative, you know,

202
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:32,716
like if Spiro Agnew held a campaign rally

203
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:36,776
that turned violent in the 60s at Knott's Berry Farm

204
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:39,756
and you were there and you know stuff about it

205
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:40,976
and you have photos, write us.

206
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,036
We'll put it in the Lost and Found.

207
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,876
You do the legwork for these episodes

208
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,116
that you are also paying for.

209
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:47,896
I was gonna say.

210
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:49,036
We're gonna do the legwork.

211
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:50,356
I just want the prompts.

212
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:51,836
I want like the. Oh, I see.

213
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:55,696
Give us a shred of info and then we'll go do our research.

214
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,056
We'll find out about stuff.

215
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,636
And I would just feel terrible if we, there's,

216
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,256
if we know somebody's yelling at their iPhone

217
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:07,356
during the Astroworld episode about, you know,

218
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,076
friend of Marvel McPhaze, we failed the name check.

219
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,296
Oh my God, we need to know that.

220
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,496
Let me just, this is bad podcasting,

221
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,276
but let me throw it back to that joke pitch.

222
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:16,936
Lee Atwater is the sheriff in Ghost Town.

223
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:18,276
If that happens. Pretty good.

224
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:18,776
Pretty good. Pretty good, right?

225
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,176
I like that. Yeah, that's good with me.

226
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:21,416
Anyway, back to what you were gonna say.

227
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,036
Oh, I was gonna say,

228
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:27,676
I think that's a fitting lead in to today's topic.

229
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,516
Absolutely. Because this is a,

230
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:32,496
an area of, well, I don't know.

231
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:33,936
It is documented,

232
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:40,276
but I felt like I hit a city limits at a certain point

233
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:41,696
in researching this.

234
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,576
There's stuff I would like to know more about

235
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,616
that I never will because it's been bulldozed.

236
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:49,576
Yeah. Can I tell you what,

237
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,376
just my reaction is what you're saying,

238
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,456
what happened to me after doing some research.

239
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:56,296
I had a visceral reaction to this place

240
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,896
and I started to feel it by the end

241
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,236
of looking at all these photos.

242
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,956
What I, the note that I wrote down is that

243
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,836
I think that tonight I will have nightmares

244
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:08,656
that are full of limited polygons.

245
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,556
That is how I will dream tonight.

246
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,256
I will dream as if I am watching a,

247
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:18,236
a pre-PlayStation 2 video game all night.

248
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:19,616
The graphics then aren't even as good

249
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:21,656
as that cartoon reboot.

250
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,516
Yeah, no, no.

251
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:26,356
Because reboot is finished and rendered and shaded.

252
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,016
Reboot is great.

253
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,276
No, all of these attractions are,

254
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:31,196
look, but you have to cut them some slack.

255
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:32,556
They were, you know,

256
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,136
these things were having to render in real time

257
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:35,936
in one review. Right.

258
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,236
But you, there's less slack to be cut

259
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,096
because this attraction was open until 2017.

260
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,536
And we're still looking at 1998 graphics.

261
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:44,536
19 years, baby.

262
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:45,816
And, God, wow.

263
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,936
Well, and, and just to say it,

264
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,276
you know it because you're,

265
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,116
you're staring at the file right now.

266
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,396
We are talking about Disney Quest.

267
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,516
But let me put this on, on you guys.

268
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,356
I'm going to put you to the test.

269
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,876
I like to, even though I think probably behind the,

270
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,416
with the, with the Patreon episodes,

271
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:05,136
we're getting a lot of people who don't need Disney Quest

272
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,036
explained to them.

273
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,656
However, if you had to explain Disney Quest

274
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:12,596
to someone who didn't know what Disney Quest was,

275
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,436
how would you even begin?

276
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:15,916
Sure. I'll take the lead on this.

277
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,136
I would describe it as an indoor interactive theme park.

278
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,956
That's exactly right.

279
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,816
That's how any reasonable person would describe it.

280
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:24,916
And that's a very reasonable choice.

281
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,176
Michael, do you have an objection to that?

282
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,176
Well, I was going to say you might be,

283
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,276
that sounds like company speak to me.

284
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,056
Are you saying that because it's the first item in my notes

285
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:35,476
and it's in quotation marks?

286
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,396
Yeah. I have it too, Jason.

287
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:38,676
I have the same thing.

288
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,416
I was right.

289
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,536
I listened to like a,

290
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,656
I think probably the president of Disney

291
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:46,776
regional entertainment explain what this thing was.

292
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:48,436
I'm calling this shot now,

293
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,536
Disney regional entertainment episode.

294
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:52,736
Oh, just the whole thing.

295
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:53,916
Just the whole thing.

296
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:57,536
Well, they only had three enterprises, right?

297
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:58,236
Yes.

298
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,896
I guess, I guess we can just break up the enterprises,

299
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,656
but this, I feel like-

300
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:07,496
Although I'd be more than happy to hit them in two birds

301
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:10,956
with one stone and to cover what it's ESPN zone

302
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,436
and club Disney.

303
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,056
Disney's Chuck E. Cheese.

304
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:15,016
I think I said Disney play,

305
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,836
which is the new streaming service that's coming soon.

306
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:18,516
Sorry.

307
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,696
Club Disney.

308
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,796
How dare you not keep this corporate speak

309
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:23,956
and you're straight in your brain.

310
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:26,996
We'll do Disney play when it launches

311
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,536
and it'll be a lot of us going, oh.

312
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:32,896
When I read about this Disney Quest,

313
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,076
I was so excited.

314
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:37,596
I couldn't have been more excited because in my mind,

315
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,936
the easiest way to describe it was it's Disney,

316
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:42,096
but it's all virtual reality games.

317
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,396
That's, and to me at the time,

318
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,676
I was very excited about that.

319
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:47,176
Like when you first heard about it.

320
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:48,356
When I first heard about it and it was,

321
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:51,316
it seemed very simple in concept to me as a kid.

322
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:51,836
Sure.

323
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:54,056
It was virtual reality, but it was Disney.

324
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:57,716
I feel like I'm jealous that you got that breakdown.

325
00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:59,936
I feel like I learned about it for the first time

326
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:03,956
being at Downtown Disney where it was built.

327
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:08,516
And I don't think, I remember asking people

328
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,616
and them saying, yeah, it's kind of this indoor.

329
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,236
It's like video games, but it's bigger than that.

330
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,376
It's not a nose in arcade.

331
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,476
No, it's more complicated than that.

332
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:18,776
Like I don't think I understood what it was

333
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:20,376
until I got into the building.

334
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:23,056
And still, I don't know if I understood.

335
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,356
And then having to explain to my dad

336
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:29,796
why we needed to go in there, I don't think he got it.

337
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,636
And I don't think he lasted more than an hour.

338
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:34,876
Can I ask, so who here went to Disney Quest?

339
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,796
I did. You did?

340
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:36,256
Me.

341
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,416
Oh, so I'm the only one who never did.

342
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,716
I never went to Disney Quest.

343
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,536
And I knew all about it,

344
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:46,156
because 1998 was like the height of my family's

345
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:48,156
vacation club membership.

346
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:50,416
So we got mailings about every,

347
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,556
because for whatever reason, in the late 90s,

348
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:56,436
they were pushing stuff not in the parks.

349
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:57,716
They were pushing La Nuba,

350
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,296
they were pushing Downtown Disney real big,

351
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:01,996
and they were pushing Disney Quest.

352
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,796
And I think we just never went because

353
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:09,016
we were probably already spending enough money.

354
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:12,576
And then I think also we kind of came to the consensus of

355
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:16,676
like, we kind of do Downtown Disney in like half a day.

356
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,016
Do we want to give up another half a day in the parks?

357
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:24,376
I was adamant that we were going to Disney Quest.

358
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,576
We went the opening summer.

359
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,656
I read about it probably in a Disney,

360
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:30,156
man, I don't know if we were still doing Disney Adventure

361
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,636
at that point, but I read about it somewhere.

362
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:32,356
I was obsessed.

363
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,136
I love virtual reality.

364
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,156
That virtual boy that I did not,

365
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,316
my parents would not buy me,

366
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,216
but anytime I played it, even though it sucked,

367
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,576
I was like, this is pretty good.

368
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:42,136
Like, do you guys ever play virtual boy?

369
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,976
You were trying to like it.

370
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:47,676
I never got a seizure, so that's good news.

371
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,436
Yeah, I did not get a seizure though.

372
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,756
I did, as we'll find out,

373
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:56,116
it was not pleased with what happened to me at Disney Quest.

374
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:56,976
Oh boy.

375
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:58,476
What a tease.

376
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,736
Yeah, so I was obsessed with it.

377
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:01,816
I was obsessed with like,

378
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:05,236
this reminds me of the time in my life

379
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,556
when I was obsessed with like going inside the computer.

380
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:12,336
There was a UPN show called Deadly Games that I loved

381
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:15,056
that has Christopher Lloyd starring

382
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:17,496
as a character named Sebastian Jackle.

383
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,156
Well, I like that already.

384
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:21,376
I loved any Christopher Lloyd stuff.

385
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:25,256
And it was a UPN show about Brent Spiner,

386
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,096
who was data on Star Trek was on it

387
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:31,436
as like this like wacky jokery kind of like guy,

388
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:34,656
but it was all like, you're going inside the computer.

389
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,976
And I was for some reason obsessed with that idea.

390
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:40,916
So when Disney Quest came out, I was like virtual reality

391
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,056
and I made it, I was like telling my parent,

392
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,636
like we gotta go, we gotta do this.

393
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:48,436
And on the last day of our trip in 98, we did it.

394
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,776
Oh man, you fucked up.

395
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:53,076
I was so excited.

396
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:56,116
This is like just as excited for maybe more

397
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,596
in anticipation of this than Tower of Terror,

398
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,856
Rock and Roller Coaster, any of the big rides

399
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,036
I got to go on later.

400
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,636
Like that we were like going down

401
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:05,036
to see what the new thing was.

402
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:08,056
You built this up as big in your brain as possible,

403
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:10,696
which is certainly not the set up to any sort of.

404
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:11,736
No, yeah.

405
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:14,936
The end of the story will be that you loved it very much.

406
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:15,296
Yeah.

407
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,476
I feel like we may have missed a little bit

408
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,636
of fundamentals about this.

409
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:20,016
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:25,456
Okay, June, 1998, I believe was the opening.

411
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,476
We have previously talked about Pleasure Island,

412
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:29,796
which is this.

413
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:33,976
So in the 70s, there's this Disney Village marketplace

414
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,776
that opens up, but it's kind of separate

415
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,596
from the theme parks at Disney World.

416
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,776
Just like mellow little shopping zone.

417
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:45,776
They add the hip 80s nightlife to that zone

418
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,416
with Pleasure Island in 87,

419
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:49,196
and then they keep expanding it

420
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,496
and rename the whole area Downtown Disney.

421
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:54,456
And as part of that rebrand in 1998,

422
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,196
they opened the West Side.

423
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:57,496
The West Side, baby.

424
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,716
We're talking Virgin Megastore.

425
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:01,616
We're talking Disney Quest.

426
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,676
We're talking an original Cirque du Soleil production

427
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:09,116
called La Nuba in a brand new arena built just for La Nuba.

428
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:10,216
Have you seen La Nuba?

429
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,716
I did not see La Nuba.

430
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:12,636
I did not see.

431
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:13,156
I did not see La Nuba.

432
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,676
My dad always wanted to see La Nuba.

433
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:18,336
We always wanted to see Cirque du Soleil down there.

434
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:21,616
And again, we were just like, but that's a night.

435
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,436
We're not going out to dinner or going to the parks.

436
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,556
And I think we just never got it together.

437
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:29,036
My mom also very thrifty.

438
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:32,076
I think that's why I kind of gave up on virtual reality

439
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,276
at one point, because I like,

440
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:36,336
I'm going to have to fight to get money for the,

441
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,096
I'm going to have to argue to get money

442
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:39,576
for virtual reality stuff.

443
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:40,816
Free up the funds.

444
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,636
To, yes, free up the funds.

445
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,676
Give a little like PowerPoint presentation

446
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,316
showing why this is a good investment.

447
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,316
I'd like to use your money wisely, mother.

448
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:50,416
And let me explain why.

449
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,196
And I knew it would be a less than satisfying experience

450
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:56,036
for me because of one thing, baby, glasses.

451
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:58,636
Glass, a little kid with big glasses,

452
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,136
virtual reality helmets, not exactly.

453
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:03,536
Even the void, the void was pretty good.

454
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,816
The void had the best headset for glass.

455
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,936
I think they're a little better design nowadays.

456
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,356
And although maybe I would have had a better luck

457
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,316
at Disney Quest because they had some pretty innovative

458
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:15,916
for the time kind of VR headsets.

459
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:20,736
You're like, evening at the improv style,

460
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:25,696
the standup set about like the perils of wearing glasses

461
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:26,816
under VR.

462
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,236
I just remember.

463
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:31,736
Where my dude's at, who are trying to fit glasses

464
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,596
under a VR helmet.

465
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,656
I remember trying to do it at, and I talked about this.

466
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,036
I, on another episode at Funscape,

467
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:41,136
which for this episode, I went back,

468
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:44,336
I did find proof that Funscape existed.

469
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,476
This was the family entertainment.

470
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:47,496
I thought you were a liar.

471
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:48,216
Play zone.

472
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,236
I swear you were making this up.

473
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,196
I mean, it did feel like you were.

474
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,216
Funscape does feel like a fake name.

475
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,496
It does feel like a fake name.

476
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,496
Turns out it was not just connected to Regal.

477
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:59,256
Regal Cinemas was an endeavor that they funded

478
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:03,456
as like these entertainment centers in Wilmington, Delaware,

479
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:07,076
Fort Lauderdale, Rochester, New York.

480
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:10,656
And there were these giant centers and they lasted

481
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:13,696
about as long as the Chicago Disney Quest,

482
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,716
which is to say two to three years.

483
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,176
Which I never went to.

484
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,076
Which you never went to.

485
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:18,656
That's odd.

486
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:19,436
That's very odd.

487
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:19,836
Because I'm from there.

488
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:24,316
You know, my father-in-law, a Regal executive.

489
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:24,856
Really?

490
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:26,216
In that era.

491
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,956
And he's never opened up about Funscape.

492
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:29,976
He's never talked about Funscape?

493
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,916
I need to, I bet he has no idea what that is.

494
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,116
Yeah.

495
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:34,096
Probably a different division.

496
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:36,376
But I did find out that Wilmington, Delaware one,

497
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,136
which may have been the biggest judging from it,

498
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:42,536
did introduce stadium seating in movie theaters

499
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,216
to the state of Delaware.

500
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,396
Wait, not to America?

501
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,016
Not to America.

502
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:47,696
To Delaware only.

503
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:48,216
To Delaware.

504
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:49,736
Or at least a region.

505
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,216
There was a lot of buildup.

506
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,956
That was the first place I remember stadium seating.

507
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,536
There was a lot of buildup.

508
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:58,076
A little puff of fart at the end.

509
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:59,076
Yeah, kind of.

510
00:19:59,116 --> 00:19:59,556
To Delaware.

511
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:00,856
To Delaware, yeah.

512
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,416
They all had to sit on a level.

513
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:06,396
Just a lot of smaller, kind of jankier theaters

514
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:10,136
or beat up AMCs, a number of which are still in business

515
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,996
and remain pretty beat up.

516
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:14,656
But Regals were always nicer.

517
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,516
Once they started coming to my area,

518
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,136
Regals were usually nicer than AMCs.

519
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:25,956
I would love to delve into various movie theater locations

520
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,656
and our feelings about the brands

521
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:31,516
and which who had the best videos that played before.

522
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:34,656
We talk about, is his name Front Row Joe?

523
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:38,336
The, who I believe is the Cinemark mascot.

524
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:42,256
I think that's, he's kind of a Texas character.

525
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:43,216
So I didn't grow up with him,

526
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:44,456
but I know about Front Row Joe,

527
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:49,016
which is a weird name to give a big movie fan character

528
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:52,196
because why would you willingly happily sit

529
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:52,936
in the front row?

530
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:56,276
No, I sat in the front row for the first Avengers movie

531
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:58,716
and it was one of the most uncomfortable

532
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,216
movie going experiences of my life.

533
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,416
I sat in front row for Mission Impossible 2.

534
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:04,176
Did you?

535
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:05,296
Yeah, not great.

536
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:06,096
Yeah.

537
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:07,496
Not a great experience.

538
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:09,056
It's very extreme.

539
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:10,436
Never great.

540
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:14,896
I would, I'll just, I'd leave the film before I think

541
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,856
I'd sit through that.

542
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,936
So more episodes coming down the pipe.

543
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:23,376
We'll hand, let's get into the arguments of Regal versus.

544
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:23,756
Yeah.

545
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:25,876
This is connected enough to think about world.

546
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,036
A world history of the fundscape endeavor.

547
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,176
That Regal was also bankrupt and,

548
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,376
or it caused them to go through bankruptcy proceedings.

549
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,716
I forget which, but yeah, it wasn't a good call.

550
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:40,216
Apparently the go-karts would rattle the building.

551
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:41,936
Also indoor go-karts,

552
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:45,156
you gotta really make sure your ventilation is good.

553
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:46,536
Oh no.

554
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:47,136
Yeah.

555
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,856
Gas is not, that shouldn't be in the atmosphere.

556
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:53,376
There's one here like over by the airport in Burbank

557
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:57,796
in like a giant old warehouse and it's just the go-karts

558
00:21:57,796 --> 00:21:59,796
and they had to redo the building

559
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,876
to make sure it ventilated and.

560
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:03,376
How do you know so much about this?

561
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,336
I mean, you can kind of see it,

562
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,976
but it's also, it's just go-karts.

563
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:07,976
Have you done it though?

564
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,956
I have done it.

565
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:09,336
Oh, okay.

566
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:09,716
It's crazy.

567
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:13,036
You can get up to like 35 miles per hour in there.

568
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:13,716
Really?

569
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,236
Yeah.

570
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:15,016
Should we do it?

571
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:17,036
Should we review this on the Patreon too?

572
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:17,656
Potentially.

573
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:19,116
Is that a theme park?

574
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,456
Burbank local go-kart attraction.

575
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:21,956
Local go-karts.

576
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:24,196
Actually just the episode title,

577
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:30,296
go-kart, indoor go-kart ventilation with Jason Sheridan.

578
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:32,456
I'll put you in there as the guest.

579
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:36,596
You will like elevate you above most for that episode.

580
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:39,056
Also, maybe I'm giving them too much credit

581
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,136
cause also they were trying to add laser tag

582
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:44,196
and we're doing a Kickstarter campaign to add laser tag.

583
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:45,716
So that's not a great.

584
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:46,276
No, not a great sign.

585
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:47,476
Vote of business confidence.

586
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,776
Can I add one more, I'll make another problem.

587
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:50,216
We're making a lot of promises about the Patreon.

588
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,156
If we get to a certain amount

589
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:53,596
where we're like doing very well,

590
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,476
we will go out in the desert and review that

591
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,996
racing cars bachelor party I took

592
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:01,056
where we all drive cars very fast

593
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:03,296
to like 125 miles an hour on a track

594
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,376
with two other maniacs.

595
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:05,556
Oh, I would consider that.

596
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:06,816
So let's all do that too.

597
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:08,956
Goes, oh, that's another thing

598
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:10,396
that Disney was pushing in the nineties,

599
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:11,916
the wide world of sports.

600
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:12,956
I'm sure it was a similar.

601
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:14,536
It was a similar thing to this.

602
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,976
So well, except so they're famously

603
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:19,636
one of the incidents of the wide world of sports.

604
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:21,316
Someone died in the race car there.

605
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:24,536
The reason being they weren't going the wrong way

606
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,156
on the track.

607
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:28,016
The track had been designed to drive either clockwise

608
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:30,316
or counterclockwise and they had been running the cars

609
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:33,096
the wrong way for a while, I guess.

610
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:34,016
I don't know this.

611
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:34,716
We got it.

612
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:35,956
We got into the whole thing.

613
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:36,236
All right.

614
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:38,076
Anyway, I brought up Funscape

615
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:41,196
because that is my first memory of doing like a,

616
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:44,056
like $5, $10 VR thing.

617
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:47,116
And then go and like, yeah, glasses will fit.

618
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:50,796
Having to put this headset on and like squinting

619
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,336
while doing V of like zapping, yeah, polygons.

620
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:58,856
You've never had an experience to your liking fully.

621
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,256
No, not, not really.

622
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,916
Maybe not until the void.

623
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:03,876
That was better.

624
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:05,576
Even, even as a glasses.

625
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,116
The void I thought was very good.

626
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:08,896
They've done a much better job lately.

627
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,556
Like with just 3D glasses in general,

628
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,736
even if it's not virtual reality,

629
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:14,556
cause Lindsay hates all 3D things.

630
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,956
But then Flight of Passage was great,

631
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,956
which is the Orlando Avatar ride.

632
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,496
So that, like that worked perfectly.

633
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,556
And then we did VR in Japan and they make enough room now

634
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:27,176
for glasses for most of these different places.

635
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:28,476
So, and she loved that stuff.

636
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:29,396
Not all of it.

637
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:33,556
So there was a time when Flight of Passage was,

638
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:37,436
Flight of Passage was open at the same time as

639
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:42,076
Disney Quest. This building full of 1998, you know,

640
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:46,936
watching a like, you know, a video game rendered

641
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,396
like Sultan's Guard in an Aladdin ride.

642
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:50,236
Oh. You could go,

643
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,916
you could do both of these experiences.

644
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:53,116
Graphics. A couple hours.

645
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:53,936
Your phone.

646
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:56,596
You could play higher graphic games on your phone.

647
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,236
Kids were probably sick of it.

648
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:00,816
And it's like, hey, we gotta hang out here for another hour.

649
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,536
This is playing Fortnite on their phone.

650
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,036
How many Disney quests?

651
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:07,936
How many like tricked parents over the years

652
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:10,796
where they were not on Disney and somebody was like,

653
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,616
like, oh, Disney Quest is down there and they walked in

654
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:15,796
and they paid their money upfront and then they were stuck.

655
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,536
Like they were like, oh shit.

656
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,936
Like this is what it was.

657
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:19,276
That was my term.

658
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,236
My dad wanted out of there as quick as possible.

659
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,456
And I didn't necessarily argue with him.

660
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,976
I think my dad, now that I think about it,

661
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,096
didn't even go in.

662
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:27,096
Good call.

663
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:28,976
I think he stayed out and hung around.

664
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:31,256
I could be wrong about, I have to check.

665
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:32,336
What fun is a dad gonna have?

666
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:34,416
Also the video games are hard to play.

667
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:35,556
I think my dad would have enjoyed it

668
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:38,056
and my mom would have done like the jungle,

669
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:39,996
the paddling one or one of the,

670
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,076
yeah, we did the paddling one.

671
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,196
And then she would have pulled a paperback book

672
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:46,336
out of her purse and found a well lit spot,

673
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:50,816
which is not easy, I feel like, in the videos of this.

674
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:53,316
Dude, depressing, I might even say,

675
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,096
like atmosphere and lighting.

676
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:55,196
Well, just dark.

677
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:57,336
It's like a children's entertainment center

678
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:58,556
and it's so dark.

679
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:00,236
Really claustrophobic.

680
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:04,216
So okay, if you were at the Downtown Disney West Side

681
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:06,756
starting in 1998, there's a lot of,

682
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:09,796
I like that skyline when you're looking over,

683
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:11,056
when you're looking at maps

684
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:12,816
or like the hotel informational videos

685
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:14,436
and you're sweeping over this skyline

686
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,956
that has the big globe of the planet Hollywood

687
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:20,836
and the big pineapple of the bongos, Cuban cafe

688
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:23,136
and the tent of Cirque du Soleil

689
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:27,936
and then the centerpiece of it all, a big blue box,

690
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,636
which is Disney Quest.

691
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:31,516
A big windowless building.

692
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:35,076
So yeah, what this was was a,

693
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:38,136
it's a five story windowless building

694
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:41,416
that is covered, that is full of video games,

695
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:45,416
but also kind of more fleshed out VR experiences.

696
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:50,756
And the idea was to use this starting location

697
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:57,036
as a way to do, okay, look, building an entire theme park

698
00:26:57,036 --> 00:27:01,496
at various spots in America is pretty cost prohibitive

699
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,776
for Disney at this point.

700
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:05,656
And they can't exactly go build a Disneyland

701
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:09,016
outside of Chicago or Philadelphia or any of these places,

702
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:12,196
but what they can do potentially is go into a city center,

703
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:17,016
take over some space and do kind of a more compact

704
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:18,956
indoor theme park experience.

705
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:22,196
So they opened Disney Quest in Orlando

706
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:26,656
with the intent of opening it up in different cities

707
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:28,116
across America.

708
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,276
And across the world, I think,

709
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:33,656
because specifically they wanted to open 20 to 30 of these

710
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,136
within 10 years.

711
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,636
Eisner's talking about in that,

712
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,216
there's an opening video from Chicago

713
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,296
and he's talking about what Philadelphia was next

714
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:42,036
on their plan.

715
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,056
So Philadelphia, they broke ground on.

716
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:44,636
Right, yeah, yeah.

717
00:27:44,636 --> 00:27:47,096
They were doing construction at Athe and Market,

718
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:49,416
like right in Center City, Philadelphia.

719
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:52,496
What blew my mind is that I didn't know,

720
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,056
I don't know Philadelphia very well,

721
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:55,336
so the fact that it is like,

722
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:58,216
it is a five minute walk away from the Liberty Bell.

723
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:00,716
From all of it, Independence Hall,

724
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,436
yeah, the Liberty Bell, the Convention Center,

725
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:04,756
the Reading Terminal Market,

726
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:07,856
which is sort of like Grand Central Market in LA.

727
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:12,296
And it's right next to a regional transit hub,

728
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:15,776
trains, subway trains, regional trains.

729
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:19,136
There's a Greyhound station in that area,

730
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:21,396
so like high traffic area.

731
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:25,316
And still a parking lot,

732
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:27,436
still they started construction

733
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,896
and then they stopped when the Chicago one failed.

734
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:31,536
They dug a hole.

735
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:32,096
Yeah.

736
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:34,116
That was going to be the basis

737
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:37,256
for this five story video game place

738
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:39,576
and didn't get past the hole.

739
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,716
And the hole was there for many, many years

740
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:45,036
and was referred to as the Disney Hole.

741
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:47,736
It has now been paved over and is a parking lot.

742
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:48,456
It's a parking lot.

743
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,816
But there's supposed to be apartment towers

744
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,016
being built in the Market East neighborhood

745
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:53,816
that they call this.

746
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:56,036
I don't know if it's going on top of that,

747
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,636
but that would seemingly make the right place.

748
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:02,096
Building towers in cities takes years.

749
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,096
Disney doesn't own the land still, do they?

750
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:04,996
I don't think so.

751
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:05,596
I don't think so, no.

752
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,376
Or they never maybe owned it.

753
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,016
They were just gonna.

754
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:11,316
But you know the idea there, so yeah,

755
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,476
so as I said, the first one opened in Orlando in 98,

756
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:17,336
followed by Chicago in 99, I believe.

757
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,696
Yeah, in June 99.

758
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:20,936
And then they were going to open Philadelphia in 2000

759
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:23,136
and they were trying to get this location open

760
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,556
in time for the Republican National Convention.

761
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,536
Yes, the Republican National Convention.

762
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:32,016
For the event at which George W. Bush

763
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,396
was confirmed as the Republican nominee

764
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:36,796
and the gates of hell opened.

765
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:37,316
Oh yeah.

766
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:39,936
All of these people were all going to,

767
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:43,256
Strom Thurmond was gonna be hanging out at Disney Quest.

768
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,496
He was gonna be strapping on a helmet.

769
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,696
He was gonna be designing his own roller coaster.

770
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,376
Oh yeah, Dick Shady.

771
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:52,516
Dick Shady exploring, riding the comics.

772
00:29:53,816 --> 00:29:54,636
Riding the comics.

773
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:58,396
My memory of the Republican Convention in Philadelphia

774
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,196
is that I wasn't there.

775
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:02,796
I was at Boy Scout camp for the week.

776
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:04,256
Why would you?

777
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,776
I'm sure you would have been there.

778
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:06,556
Were you invited?

779
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,716
No, but I remember being very mad

780
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:10,976
because I was like. You wanted to go?

781
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,456
No, I wanted to watch the Daily Show

782
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:14,876
without the Republican Convention.

783
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:17,316
So I made my dad take the Daily Show all week

784
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,956
and he was like, yeah, I went down.

785
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:23,896
At the time, you could just walk around the convention.

786
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:24,896
He was like, yeah, I went down.

787
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:25,596
I walked around.

788
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:27,216
Whatever.

789
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:30,016
You're sure your dad went to the Republican National Convention

790
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:31,256
and hung around?

791
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:34,396
Yeah, because you could just do that back then, I guess.

792
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,696
Before 9-11, you could just walk through.

793
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:38,516
Or they had like, maybe they had an area,

794
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:40,996
the visitor center area or something set up for it.

795
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:42,576
But he like went around and walked around.

796
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:44,056
I think he bought a companion.

797
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:45,936
But you were very much a, you were very much a liberal.

798
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:49,556
No, none of us were like jazz for George W. Bush.

799
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:51,156
So he was going to be like,

800
00:30:51,156 --> 00:30:52,416
I'm going to check out the opposition

801
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,136
just because it was a historical moment in the city.

802
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:58,256
I don't really know how either of my parents

803
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,836
felt about George W. Bush.

804
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:02,956
I think pretty quickly we're like, oh, this guy's an idiot.

805
00:31:04,216 --> 00:31:07,496
Yeah, it was a thing to do because me and my brother

806
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:08,576
were out of town.

807
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,056
So it was like it was a thing.

808
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:11,956
As if a fair rolled into town.

809
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,916
He'd be like, go check out that fair over there.

810
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:16,836
Oh, there's a bunch of evil people in a convention center.

811
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,056
Go check out the evil people in the convention center.

812
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,636
Yeah.

813
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:20,216
Yeah, right.

814
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,496
I mean, I guess it was close.

815
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,296
I guess it was in the Burbank.

816
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,076
It was over here in the Burbank Hotel.

817
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:28,156
I'd go check out the Republican National Convention.

818
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:30,336
Yeah, I think they were like at the time,

819
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:33,436
I think people really didn't give a shit about politics.

820
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:34,936
And it was just kind of like, oh, look,

821
00:31:35,016 --> 00:31:35,256
it's something to do.

822
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:36,276
It was a different time, you're right.

823
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:37,176
Yeah.

824
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:41,456
So the Disney Quest.

825
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:42,336
The Disney Quest, yeah.

826
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,236
That's the thing we were talking about.

827
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:48,416
The, okay, so first things first, as we said,

828
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:51,436
big, tall, it's essentially just a blue box.

829
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:55,296
There is the big words Disney Quest on it.

830
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:57,976
And there's kind of Mickey ears,

831
00:31:58,076 --> 00:31:59,856
but done kind of a little more,

832
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,276
little more hip, a little bit.

833
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:03,016
It's like a big scribble.

834
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:06,816
And that's the only decor on the outside of this thing.

835
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:11,776
Otherwise it is such a kind of murky, unpleasant behemoth.

836
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,496
I find that building to be hideous.

837
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:20,096
And to me, Disney Quest typifies

838
00:32:20,096 --> 00:32:25,856
what I'm going to call the Disney 90s aesthetic dive.

839
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:30,096
In the 80s, especially Epcot Center,

840
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:33,916
I think Disney was like leading the charge of cool design

841
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:39,556
and stuff that I think still is neat

842
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:41,196
and what people's vision of the future is.

843
00:32:41,196 --> 00:32:43,636
And then you start around the 90s.

844
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:47,136
I mean, I think a lot of design got shitty in the 90s,

845
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:51,496
but this entire place and all the signage within it,

846
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:52,416
it just reminds me of,

847
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:54,936
I remember my yearbooks around that time.

848
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:55,356
Oh yeah.

849
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,216
Starting to become this weird where everything's

850
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,176
in lowercase for no reason.

851
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:03,276
And every letter is in a different font

852
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:05,716
and a different color and things are scribbly.

853
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:09,016
And an O is a CD.

854
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:11,916
And Disney starts getting into this kind of thing.

855
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,316
And I think in the lead up you have

856
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:16,156
when they switched from Epcot,

857
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:18,356
which was sleek and cool and I'm biased

858
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:19,576
because I love that aesthetic so much.

859
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:22,256
But when it became Epcot 94

860
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:24,036
and all the signage got you.

861
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:27,336
And in inventions, I find really aesthetically unpleasant.

862
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:27,716
Yeah.

863
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:29,336
Oh, I loved all of this shit as a kid.

864
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:29,936
Really, really?

865
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:31,216
Well, as a kid I did.

866
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:33,476
But I see that it looks gaudy as shit now.

867
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:34,296
It is not aged super well.

868
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:35,516
It is not aged super well.

869
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,616
I regret not going to Disney Quest a couple of times

870
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,856
the last few years that I was in Florida.

871
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:43,396
I was like, oh, I could have still gone.

872
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,816
It's crazy, I couldn't wrap my head around

873
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,596
that it was still there until last year.

874
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:49,556
Really strange.

875
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:52,256
It seems like such a product of its time.

876
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:56,416
And it would have been exactly what I liked at the time.

877
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:58,696
And it is a way, I mean, there's a lot of things.

878
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,056
There's corners of Epcot Center

879
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:01,376
that haven't changed since 82

880
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:04,056
and it's a little time travel you get to do.

881
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,716
But especially that in 2017,

882
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:11,276
you could have really literally taken a leap into 1998

883
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:13,696
and some of the worst aesthetic indulgences,

884
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:16,516
the exact same computer technology

885
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:18,916
that was powering everything in 98.

886
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:21,256
You see just compact computers.

887
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:21,916
Oh yeah.

888
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:25,936
It's so out of date and they made no effort to keep it up.

889
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:29,136
And aesthetics are a big part of that.

890
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:32,856
I hate every sign that I saw delving into all this stuff.

891
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:35,596
There's like 12 circles in the queue,

892
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,096
the Disney Quest queue.

893
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:39,916
It's like this like just squiggly circle

894
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,656
and his ears are squiggly circles.

895
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:44,016
And it's like, ugh.

896
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:45,396
You know what's another aesthetic

897
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:46,236
I wanna bring up really fast?

898
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:50,836
Do you remember when ABC switched to that yellow,

899
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,496
the black on yellow?

900
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:57,076
This isn't something that struck you or didn't bother you.

901
00:34:57,316 --> 00:34:58,156
They were all, I mean, I just like.

902
00:34:58,156 --> 00:34:58,476
Let me look.

903
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:02,036
There was this particular campaign they did around like 96,

904
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:04,876
97 when they would have been promoting like two guys,

905
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:07,816
a girl in a pizza place and these kinds of shots.

906
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:10,256
I just, I find it like hideous.

907
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:11,776
Look at maybe see yellow.

908
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,756
That might give it to you.

909
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:14,796
That's the one now.

910
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:15,396
Oh yeah.

911
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,856
And that's fairly clear.

912
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:17,896
It was just like bad.

913
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:21,056
I don't know why everything became like hideous,

914
00:35:21,256 --> 00:35:25,276
scratchy fonts and all lowercase with a lot of attitude.

915
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:26,916
Yeah, you're in that neck of the woods.

916
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:27,996
Anyway, I don't.

917
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:28,936
Something like that.

918
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:31,316
I'll post what I'm talking about.

919
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:33,556
I just remember seeing these awful ABC posters

920
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:35,136
starting to go up around Disneyland.

921
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:36,856
Aesthetics just got so off.

922
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:38,416
Red Rockets pizza port.

923
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,156
That's an aesthetic nightmare.

924
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:40,816
Yeah.

925
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,816
All of Tomorrowland 98 in general.

926
00:35:42,936 --> 00:35:45,136
I just don't know what happened.

927
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:48,736
Everything just got so sloppy and like kooky

928
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:49,596
and in your face.

929
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:52,016
I mean, the city walk Lego is kind of an example of that too.

930
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,236
So like the map, the map of Disney Quest.

931
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,456
That's pretty icky.

932
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:57,856
Yes, what you're showing me right there is pretty icky.

933
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:03,156
And the score zone, the replay zone,

934
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:07,516
the create zone and food quest.

935
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,976
Food Quest is my favorite.

936
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,816
Like there's no way the food quest was good.

937
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:13,636
What a lazy.

938
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:15,516
Food Quest is so lazy.

939
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:18,916
I, god, there's so much.

940
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:19,776
This is a lot.

941
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:21,496
I loved the research for this.

942
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:24,116
It reminded me of researching for Hard Rock Park

943
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:26,956
where I would just peel back one layer of the onion.

944
00:36:26,956 --> 00:36:27,736
Yeah, this might be.

945
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,736
And find a new layer of the onion.

946
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:32,176
This might not be the only Disney Quest.

947
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,556
Yeah, we might not get to.

948
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:36,816
Well, but here to keep us on track

949
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:39,536
and to help us get through it all is the zone keeper.

950
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:40,336
All right, I'm gonna.

951
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:41,796
No, absolutely not.

952
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:43,876
I think we could use that.

953
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,576
I think that's the only way.

954
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:47,956
I think we need somebody to guide us through this.

955
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:52,976
Okay, so let me, then let's take it a little orderly.

956
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:55,816
Let's at least, you know, once you're inside Disney Quest,

957
00:36:56,016 --> 00:36:58,396
you can go to any of the four zones that you want.

958
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,516
But the first, but to get in,

959
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,556
there's an experience that you have to have.

960
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:05,616
You have to walk in to this rotunda.

961
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:07,076
And I'm looking at this photo.

962
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,116
When I talk about crazy,

963
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:10,276
I actually don't mind this that much.

964
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:15,456
I'm looking at a room that is a bunch of gold pillars

965
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:19,296
that have gold busts of Disney characters,

966
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:22,136
all your favorite characters, like, you know,

967
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:27,116
Pinocchio, Pocahontas, and one of the Mighty Ducks

968
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:29,716
from the 90s Mighty Ducks cartoon.

969
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:35,096
And then there's a black and white zebra striped ring

970
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:39,196
above that that shows a fake indoor sky rotunda,

971
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:40,736
like the Caesar's Palace Mall.

972
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,276
And then around the ring,

973
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:45,896
it says the full word supercalifragilistic ex-fialidocious.

974
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:52,276
The vibe of this room is extremely 90s cyber lawnmower man

975
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:53,116
disclosure.

976
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,036
This is a 90s ass endeavor.

977
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:57,336
All of this is a 90s ass endeavor.

978
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:59,176
It feels like you were, especially this room,

979
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,556
it feels like you were entering a CD-ROM

980
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:03,136
and walking around a CD-ROM.

981
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:05,656
Any listeners who are into that CD-ROM aesthetic,

982
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,896
please look up some Disney Quest photos.

983
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:08,776
You won't be disappointed.

984
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:12,356
I remember going into, like, this may be,

985
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:15,256
maybe I'm misremembering or I'm trying to, like,

986
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:16,516
act like I knew what I was doing,

987
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:19,156
or act like I knew something was good or not

988
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:19,896
by just seeing it.

989
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:22,836
But I remember walking into there and knowing,

990
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:25,296
feeling, it didn't feel good to me.

991
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:28,776
I just remember the feeling of the place.

992
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:30,896
It immediately let me down a little bit.

993
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:33,676
There was no way I would express that when I was that age,

994
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,636
but I do remember the feeling that I did not have on,

995
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:38,556
as this is like Tower of Terror, all that stuff.

996
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:39,636
You would see the building go,

997
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:40,896
oh my God, this looks great.

998
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,956
There was a vibe in there from the start

999
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:46,516
that you are not going to like this.

1000
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:48,876
You feel like you're walking into some weird sex club

1001
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:49,696
or something. Yes.

1002
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,196
It's something shady, for sure.

1003
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:54,296
It's like, there's a cheapness to it.

1004
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:54,816
Absolutely.

1005
00:38:55,076 --> 00:38:57,676
I bet there was a big old-lunch crunch

1006
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,176
during the building of this thing.

1007
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:01,016
Because even if you're not a nerd for this,

1008
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:02,516
you can feel when something's cheap.

1009
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:05,816
Have you guys seen, there was a rendering of the,

1010
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:09,616
what the outdoor, what the exterior of DisneyQuest

1011
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:11,736
was going to look like that is a lot more impressive

1012
00:39:11,736 --> 00:39:12,796
than what it ended up being,

1013
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,796
which is kind of like four walls,

1014
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,196
sorta painted on and scribbled on.

1015
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,276
But the concept art was so much better.

1016
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:21,876
And I think there's a lot of things in DisneyQuest

1017
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:24,716
on the inside as well that, with infinite budget,

1018
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:25,616
could have been cool as hell,

1019
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,216
but I bet it got stepped down.

1020
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,236
Sure, yeah.

1021
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:29,256
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1022
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,796
Here's my thing.

1023
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:35,916
I know aesthetically, a lot of this is not great design,

1024
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:40,256
but I associate it with a very happy childhood.

1025
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:44,916
And happy, I have a hard time untangling, like-

1026
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:45,876
But you never went.

1027
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:49,756
I never went, but I liked the brochures about it.

1028
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:52,156
In your head, it's like the blue sky version of it.

1029
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,536
And you'll never get to go there, so you can imagine-

1030
00:39:54,536 --> 00:39:55,856
But also, I mean, that's kind of an appeal

1031
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:56,836
of Hard Rock Park, too.

1032
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:58,496
You know what this reminds me of now to think about?

1033
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:00,196
This whole aesthetic reminds me of when they introduced

1034
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:03,716
those Pop Tarts that had the blue and purple frosting on them.

1035
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:04,516
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1036
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:05,656
Like just the like-

1037
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,136
Oh yes, the Wild Berry?

1038
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:10,496
Thank you, Wild Berry Pop Tarts, which I do like,

1039
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,576
but it's an ugly look.

1040
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:14,596
It doesn't look attract, it doesn't look appealing.

1041
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:15,896
It looks like it's for-

1042
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:19,596
I think part of it, too, is, and Mike,

1043
00:40:19,596 --> 00:40:20,796
I know you will get this,

1044
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:22,896
and it actually comes up in DisneyQuest,

1045
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:26,616
but when digital coloring really started to catch on in comics-

1046
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:29,956
Like when you saw the change from like the dots,

1047
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:32,856
the colored dots where you'd have to lay on,

1048
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,756
I honestly don't know how they-

1049
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:38,616
It's still very confusing to me how they used to color comics.

1050
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:42,436
But in the way that it was brighter and more pastel-y,

1051
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,256
and then it just got a lot more sleek.

1052
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:48,816
And you're saying you're comparing this how to DisneyQuest?

1053
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:54,456
That trend in the 90s runs concurrent with this trend

1054
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:56,996
of everything getting digitally colored

1055
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,816
or digitally designed, like all of that.

1056
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:01,336
And I think a lot of things have,

1057
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:04,736
like obviously most things are done digitally these days,

1058
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,056
and I think people have figured out

1059
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:08,256
cool aesthetics within that.

1060
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:11,216
But I think what DisneyQuest in general suffers from

1061
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:14,076
is the awkward slide into digital,

1062
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:17,676
and especially Disney having no idea

1063
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,496
how to play it or work within that.

1064
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:22,276
Because you used to just have like red, what was it?

1065
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,976
Black, yellow, red, blue.

1066
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:28,376
And that's how you would color the newspaper comics.

1067
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,376
And you could combine them to make greens

1068
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:33,876
and purples and stuff, but you were limited.

1069
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:35,776
I will say, I feel like there was a,

1070
00:41:36,176 --> 00:41:39,776
people loved teal and purple specifically.

1071
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:43,796
I don't know why those colors seem like in the late 90s.

1072
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,816
GameCube was purple in 2001, which I guess is now 90s,

1073
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:49,376
but around that same time.

1074
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:50,896
Tomorrowland 94.

1075
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:52,636
I know what you're saying is as far as just like

1076
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:55,156
the colors of it, it does feel like of a time.

1077
00:41:55,576 --> 00:41:58,296
And it's not that I hate the color scheme of it,

1078
00:41:58,296 --> 00:41:59,916
but when you look at the pictures inside,

1079
00:42:00,396 --> 00:42:04,096
I remember feeling just let down, I felt sad.

1080
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:07,636
It was very dark, it was very, well here, let's get inside.

1081
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:09,276
But how do we get inside, guys?

1082
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:12,076
We're on the bottom floor, how do we get up to the top?

1083
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:15,796
Is there a special type of device that would take you up

1084
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,436
to the top floor? Is there like a fucking

1085
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:19,436
cyberlater, do they got a cyberlater?

1086
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,276
Oh, do they have a cyberlater?

1087
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,376
They have a cyberlater?

1088
00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:23,496
Wait, it wasn't just a regular elevator,

1089
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:25,956
it was like a, it was a full on cyberlater.

1090
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:27,776
It was a full cyberlater, yeah.

1091
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:31,636
Seeing the sign, cyberlater, cyberlater,

1092
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:35,036
cyberlater two venture port is what the sign says.

1093
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:38,836
Cyberlater for sure has to have appeared on Deadly Games

1094
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:41,616
as a villain or something, like that seems like such a cheap

1095
00:42:41,616 --> 00:42:42,876
name. Oh, a man named the cyberlater?

1096
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:47,016
Yeah, like a bad game, cyberlater played by, you know,

1097
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,996
I was gonna say Jean-Claude Van Damme,

1098
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:50,936
but that's, they didn't have the money for him in the 90s.

1099
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:52,756
Robert Davi. Okay.

1100
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:55,176
I forget who he is, but he was in a,

1101
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:57,476
he was an 80s actor who was in a Funny or Die video once

1102
00:42:57,476 --> 00:43:00,696
who was very mean and very bad to the women

1103
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:04,356
and promoted his, relentlessly promoted his

1104
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:06,036
Davi Singh Sinatra album.

1105
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:09,156
All right, Robert Davi played cyberlater on the UPN show

1106
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:11,856
Deadly Games starring Christopher Loy as Sebastian Jackal.

1107
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:13,716
That's a fact, that's canon now.

1108
00:43:13,816 --> 00:43:15,616
Yep, yeah, as far as I know.

1109
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:21,596
So you get into the cyberlater, which even once you're inside

1110
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:24,936
still feels like a regular elevator and you're looking at a

1111
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,576
mirror of yourself.

1112
00:43:26,576 --> 00:43:28,956
Yeah, it's me, what's, I see me all the time,

1113
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:29,856
what's the big deal?

1114
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:34,396
Then the doors close, the lights short out and you are gone.

1115
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:39,076
You are in pure black and replay it, the mirror is replaced

1116
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:43,936
with a big animated digital presentation starring the Genie.

1117
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:45,436
Our friend, the Genie. From Aladdin.

1118
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:49,336
Who of course famously is voiced by beloved comedian.

1119
00:43:49,976 --> 00:43:50,976
Dan Castellana.

1120
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,276
Who although a lot of the articles and videos about

1121
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:58,996
Disney Quest fail to acknowledge it is not Robin Williams.

1122
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:01,896
For sure you can listen, Dan Castellana, the voice of Homer

1123
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:06,636
was the alternate Robin Williams in all of the other things,

1124
00:44:06,656 --> 00:44:07,556
Return of Jafar.

1125
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:09,416
But not the third one where he returned.

1126
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:10,316
Oh, he came back.

1127
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:13,856
He sorted out his Disney issues, which is why he's also

1128
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,796
the timekeeper in whatever that was called.

1129
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:18,516
Why is that not coming to me?

1130
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:20,356
Oh boy, I'm losing it.

1131
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:21,516
I know what you're talking about.

1132
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:23,216
The visionary or something.

1133
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:24,076
Something like that.

1134
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,416
Sure, the cypher later.

1135
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:29,556
So a little thing and he impersonates,

1136
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:33,356
he does all his Genie hijinks and then lets you out.

1137
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:37,416
He does Mo, he does Barney Gumbel,

1138
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:40,576
he does all the impressions that we know the Genie loves to do.

1139
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,076
And then you land.

1140
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:45,576
I said Mo by the way, that's Castellana.

1141
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:47,556
I screwed up that's Anka's area.

1142
00:44:47,996 --> 00:44:48,716
Oh right.

1143
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,356
Barney is Castellana.

1144
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:51,936
Strike it from the dad is not canon.

1145
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:52,416
Grandpa.

1146
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:54,136
See, yes, there you go.

1147
00:44:54,336 --> 00:44:59,896
So you arrive at Ventureport and you walk into another

1148
00:44:59,896 --> 00:45:06,376
big rotunda that has a big telescope or something.

1149
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:08,696
Here's something I want to say.

1150
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:12,616
A lot of, especially people were tweeting this at us,

1151
00:45:12,616 --> 00:45:14,696
I think earlier in the year when this was going around,

1152
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:19,736
there was a fantastic Twitter thread explaining Disney Quest

1153
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:24,036
beat by beat done by a real video game expert named

1154
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:25,176
Max Krieger.

1155
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,656
And his Twitter handle is at MaxKriegerVG.

1156
00:45:30,976 --> 00:45:33,496
And I think it just Googled Disney Quest Twitter thread

1157
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:36,956
and it's excellent and it breaks down a lot of this stuff

1158
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:40,456
in a very concise way that doesn't take two and a half hours.

1159
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:42,896
It's a really good Twitter thread.

1160
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:45,416
But I do disagree with him on one point,

1161
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:48,076
which I think he's maybe more into this place aesthetically

1162
00:45:48,076 --> 00:45:51,356
than me and he shows a picture of the Ventureport

1163
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:51,796
and it says,

1164
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,496
guests would disembark at the heart of this massive

1165
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:54,936
five floor complex Ventureport.

1166
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:57,896
It was breathtaking all caps.

1167
00:45:57,896 --> 00:45:58,436
What?

1168
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:01,036
Full of design flourishes often overlooked.

1169
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:02,356
I don't know.

1170
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:03,796
I'm gonna show you guys a photo.

1171
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:05,176
Does this take your breath away?

1172
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:06,036
Do you still have breath?

1173
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:06,916
That's a picture.

1174
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,896
Okay, so I was looking at the picture of this

1175
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,796
and then the picture, I go, that's okay.

1176
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:12,876
I don't hate that.

1177
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:14,236
No, that's like interventions.

1178
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:15,556
But it's like interventions.

1179
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:19,396
And I have no memory of being wowed.

1180
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:22,556
I didn't walk in and go, now I've arrived at Disney Quest.

1181
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,656
I remember just like being not being able to see it.

1182
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,276
It's not lit.

1183
00:46:25,436 --> 00:46:27,996
I feel like that is just a well lit photo of it too.

1184
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:28,396
Yeah.

1185
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:30,696
My memory of it is like, it was much murkier.

1186
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:34,016
All of this was a dark place.

1187
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,056
It was so dark.

1188
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:36,096
It was bizarre.

1189
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:37,596
This is depressing and scary.

1190
00:46:38,016 --> 00:46:40,136
I think the Ventureport is good.

1191
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:43,896
But you, it's not a great experience.

1192
00:46:44,456 --> 00:46:45,616
But I've only experienced these well lit pictures.

1193
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:48,676
In theory, the Cyberlator is a magical elevator.

1194
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:49,096
That's true.

1195
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:50,856
In theory, the Ventureport is unbelievable.

1196
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:54,396
The Walt Disney Family Museum has a great themed elevator.

1197
00:46:54,716 --> 00:46:55,156
And I don't wanna tip it.

1198
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:56,056
But it's not a Cyberlator.

1199
00:46:56,056 --> 00:46:59,216
It's not a Cyberlator, but it's a very cool experience.

1200
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:00,176
Pretty disappointing.

1201
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:04,016
I'll say this, I think I'm a sucker for color delighting.

1202
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:05,336
Sure, who isn't?

1203
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,356
Yeah, I know all the videos,

1204
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:09,376
but all the walkthroughs of Disney Quest,

1205
00:47:09,456 --> 00:47:12,316
I'm like, do you like how much colored lighting is in here?

1206
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:15,376
But there's a whole course of darkness.

1207
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:17,976
It was not enough light.

1208
00:47:18,396 --> 00:47:21,316
It is so much, I think it is so much like

1209
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:22,756
Disneyland interventions.

1210
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,556
And they opened around the same time.

1211
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:26,436
I think that's some of my problem with it.

1212
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,876
I actually, Disney World interventions,

1213
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:30,596
I'm more okay with.

1214
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:32,916
It's kind of kooky or more open air.

1215
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,436
The attractions I remember and enjoy.

1216
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:37,736
Still, this is the only other thing I can remember

1217
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:40,216
from going to Disney World that I was very let down by

1218
00:47:40,216 --> 00:47:41,016
was interventions.

1219
00:47:41,476 --> 00:47:43,456
Because I remember reading all about interventions,

1220
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:44,796
so excited about it.

1221
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,296
And you get down there and it's like,

1222
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:48,096
you can play Sonic the Hedgehog.

1223
00:47:48,696 --> 00:47:50,136
Yeah, but there's a lot of them.

1224
00:47:50,596 --> 00:47:51,596
There were so many.

1225
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:53,116
You loved interventions in Florida.

1226
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,696
I loved those free video games, I sure did.

1227
00:47:57,356 --> 00:48:00,076
Here's another weird Disney Quest thing.

1228
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,836
This is a quote from the Orlando Sentinel.

1229
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:07,176
Each year, 20% to 30% of Disney Quest attractions

1230
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,396
will be replaced with something new.

1231
00:48:09,696 --> 00:48:12,436
So that was never going to fucking happen.

1232
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:15,516
Never, and whenever Disney says that, it is a trap.

1233
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:16,336
It is not.

1234
00:48:16,336 --> 00:48:17,856
There will never be the change of order.

1235
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,836
Except it's only happened with the new Star Tours.

1236
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:23,776
Sure, because that is a high profile.

1237
00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:24,516
That's true.

1238
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:25,256
There's multiple properties.

1239
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:28,616
There's a lot of financial incentive, I feel,

1240
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:29,876
to keep updating that.

1241
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:32,556
But why would they change up interventions every year?

1242
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,856
Plus, the Illuminati's given them extra funding

1243
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:37,976
to get the multiculturalism in there.

1244
00:48:38,276 --> 00:48:39,176
Because of Star Wars?

1245
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:40,196
Because of Star Wars.

1246
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:42,096
It's all propaganda now.

1247
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:45,236
I'm worried Russian bots are gonna hack

1248
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:46,756
Star Tours at some point.

1249
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:49,356
They're the ones that are sending us off

1250
00:48:49,356 --> 00:48:51,136
on that horrible collision course

1251
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,876
with the evil First Order and Crait.

1252
00:48:54,176 --> 00:48:54,756
That's true.

1253
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,796
Hey, did you guys know they did a study

1254
00:48:57,556 --> 00:49:00,716
and 51% of people who did not like the City Walk saga

1255
00:49:00,716 --> 00:49:02,356
turned out to be Russian bots.

1256
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,856
I had a feeling.

1257
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:05,076
I had a feeling, yeah.

1258
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:09,156
Because what reasonable American would not have loved

1259
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,196
every step of that.

1260
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,356
So we've now arrived at Ventureport,

1261
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:18,096
and it's in our hands.

1262
00:49:18,116 --> 00:49:19,396
We can go wherever we want.

1263
00:49:19,476 --> 00:49:20,936
We can go to the replay zone.

1264
00:49:20,976 --> 00:49:22,156
We can go to the score zone.

1265
00:49:22,456 --> 00:49:23,496
We can go to the create zone.

1266
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:25,456
We can go to the explore zone.

1267
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,716
Those are all completely different,

1268
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:30,116
as different as Tomorrowland and Frontierland.

1269
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:32,416
Very clear delineations.

1270
00:49:33,256 --> 00:49:35,336
So, I don't know, guys, where do you wanna go?

1271
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:35,996
Pick a zone.

1272
00:49:36,096 --> 00:49:39,056
Well, I think when you have five levels of entertainment

1273
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:42,656
and four worlds without limits, it's hard to choose.

1274
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:43,476
It's hard to choose.

1275
00:49:43,496 --> 00:49:46,836
So already, yeah, that is a helpful thing to remember.

1276
00:49:46,976 --> 00:49:48,916
So it's five levels, but four.

1277
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,816
Five levels, four zones.

1278
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,596
And the Cyberlator's not one of the zones.

1279
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:56,436
That just gets you to the Ventureport.

1280
00:49:56,716 --> 00:49:59,056
Did the Cyberlator would take you to the fifth,

1281
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:00,696
to the score zone first, right?

1282
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:02,496
Well, no, it would take you to the third.

1283
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:04,516
It would take you into the middle of the bay.

1284
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:05,456
It would, is that right?

1285
00:50:05,556 --> 00:50:05,896
Yes.

1286
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:07,976
And it's a 45 second elevator line

1287
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:11,116
that takes you from floor one to, well, floor three.

1288
00:50:11,156 --> 00:50:11,696
Oh, you're right, you're right.

1289
00:50:11,696 --> 00:50:13,116
It's the world's slowest elevator.

1290
00:50:13,356 --> 00:50:15,456
Well, you wanna go to the fifth floor

1291
00:50:15,456 --> 00:50:17,816
if you got hungry for FoodQuest.

1292
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:18,756
I might just kill it.

1293
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:20,376
Okay, let's just go to FoodQuest.

1294
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:20,936
Yeah.

1295
00:50:21,356 --> 00:50:23,376
So why wouldn't you start on four?

1296
00:50:24,056 --> 00:50:24,996
I don't know.

1297
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:25,936
Why wouldn't you start on five

1298
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:28,036
and work down like the Sid and Marty Croft?

1299
00:50:28,136 --> 00:50:30,276
But what was, oh, it is like Sid and Marty Croft.

1300
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:32,136
Except they deliver you to the middle.

1301
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:35,016
You know what I'd like to say really fast?

1302
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:37,136
If you're, this is all, I'm confused

1303
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:39,016
as we're saying all this out loud.

1304
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,676
I don't know if I know where I am.

1305
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,536
And if you're feeling a little lost to the listener,

1306
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:46,596
a way to get acquainted with all of the zones

1307
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:48,596
and with DisneyQuest in general might be

1308
00:50:48,596 --> 00:50:52,216
to go to YouTube and type in DisneyQuest B-roll.

1309
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,556
And once you do, you will find 18 minutes

1310
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:59,256
of raw footage that was shot to be condensed

1311
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,496
into an ad, into a shorter ad for DisneyQuest.

1312
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:02,636
Which you can also find

1313
00:51:02,636 --> 00:51:04,376
if you search DisneyQuest commercial.

1314
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:06,056
You can also see it edited down

1315
00:51:06,056 --> 00:51:08,356
or you can watch all of the raw footage

1316
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,836
in which an overacting family runs around

1317
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,856
and explores DisneyQuest.

1318
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:15,296
And this is a notable video

1319
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:17,936
because the daughter of said overacting family

1320
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:20,296
is a young Mandy Moore.

1321
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:21,056
What?

1322
00:51:21,216 --> 00:51:23,476
Yes, did you realize that watching it?

1323
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:24,016
No.

1324
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:24,836
That was Mandy Moore.

1325
00:51:24,836 --> 00:51:26,696
I really got my reaction, I did not.

1326
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:28,776
Uh-huh, I wasn't sure if you guys knew

1327
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:29,276
when I brought it up.

1328
00:51:29,276 --> 00:51:29,796
I didn't know.

1329
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:33,276
So you get to see Mandy Moore running around.

1330
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:34,276
You know, a lot of people,

1331
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:36,776
I know people are fond of her work on This Is Us,

1332
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,976
but to me, her most crucial work was saying,

1333
00:51:40,376 --> 00:51:43,216
whoa, wow, and I want that slice

1334
00:51:43,216 --> 00:51:46,976
at the Cheesecake Factory Express at FoodQuest.

1335
00:51:47,296 --> 00:51:49,596
I think she peaked a long time ago.

1336
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:52,536
Well, while we're talking about that,

1337
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,956
one of my favorite things in that commercial,

1338
00:51:54,996 --> 00:51:56,256
which I was a little disappointed

1339
00:51:56,256 --> 00:51:57,796
there wasn't more of in the B-roll,

1340
00:51:58,336 --> 00:52:01,516
is the family picking out their cheesecake treats

1341
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:04,136
and the mother who is experiencing agony

1342
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:08,376
and ecstasy simultaneously at this quarter.

1343
00:52:08,756 --> 00:52:11,156
And then like two shots later,

1344
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:14,656
she's in the butt of your bumper car things

1345
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:17,036
and she is similar look.

1346
00:52:17,036 --> 00:52:20,596
And I can't tell if she's experiencing pleasure or pain.

1347
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:23,516
It's amazing gesticulating and acting.

1348
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:26,216
And throughout this, as we cover the individual things,

1349
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:29,676
I have written down what the father of the family said

1350
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:31,016
while going into the attraction.

1351
00:52:31,256 --> 00:52:32,076
So I'll throw those in.

1352
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,216
I will say this in general,

1353
00:52:33,476 --> 00:52:35,156
that at the start of the B-roll,

1354
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:37,096
we were zooming into DisneyQuest

1355
00:52:37,096 --> 00:52:39,296
and the families pointed the wrong way,

1356
00:52:39,316 --> 00:52:41,516
looking around to see if they can find it.

1357
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,976
Then they turn around and see it was right behind them

1358
00:52:43,976 --> 00:52:44,756
the whole time.

1359
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:48,056
And the dad goes, there it is, woo!

1360
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:52,776
It's fantastic, just improvised dialogue

1361
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:54,056
by people including Mandy Moore.

1362
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:55,836
What's fascinating too is about that B-roll,

1363
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:58,876
they use it in one of the commercials for,

1364
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,256
I don't know if you guys saw this,

1365
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:02,416
there's a commercial for DisneyQuest

1366
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,776
and they use some of the footage, it's only two minutes.

1367
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,776
And they first like use some like Disney-ish music

1368
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:10,076
and then all of a sudden 15 seconds in,

1369
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:13,676
semi-charm life by the third eye blind starts playing.

1370
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:17,516
A song about heroin addiction or something, right?

1371
00:53:17,676 --> 00:53:18,296
Something like that.

1372
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:18,636
Isn't it?

1373
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,196
Well, there's like bump again and then a bump again.

1374
00:53:21,716 --> 00:53:23,156
I've heard a lot of theories about what it is.

1375
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:26,956
Yeah, so yeah, probably heroin, let's say heroin.

1376
00:53:26,976 --> 00:53:30,656
And then a hard cut to Zero to Hero from Hercules.

1377
00:53:30,896 --> 00:53:32,136
Yes, yes, yes.

1378
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:35,156
That also, when I talk about unpleasant aesthetics,

1379
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:37,456
that this place, because of when it opened,

1380
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:40,476
had to be hyping Hercules,

1381
00:53:40,996 --> 00:53:42,796
which is sort of rough in general.

1382
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:47,556
We got to remember Hercules came out in 95 or 96.

1383
00:53:47,576 --> 00:53:48,776
So it's hyping.

1384
00:53:48,876 --> 00:53:49,256
97 a little later.

1385
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:50,756
Wait, 97?

1386
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:51,216
I'm pretty sure.

1387
00:53:51,216 --> 00:53:52,156
Yeah, it's 97.

1388
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:53,116
Really?

1389
00:53:53,376 --> 00:53:54,456
I think Tarzan's 98.

1390
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:55,436
Tarzan's 98.

1391
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:58,456
And I, no, Tarzan's 99, Mulan is 98.

1392
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:01,476
Oh, Hercules in 96.

1393
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,856
It was Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1394
00:54:05,096 --> 00:54:07,096
I know all this because these are the only things

1395
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:09,096
I had to think about or do in these years.

1396
00:54:09,596 --> 00:54:10,636
Yeah, it is, okay.

1397
00:54:11,256 --> 00:54:13,316
Yeah, I must have transposed it with the other.

1398
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:14,696
I guess you went from Hero to Zero.

1399
00:54:14,776 --> 00:54:15,636
I guess so.

1400
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:19,096
I liked the Disney, the brief action,

1401
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:22,516
action animated Hercules, Mulan,

1402
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:25,016
and I really don't have much memories of it.

1403
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:25,676
It's not like you liked everything

1404
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:26,916
at this period of your life.

1405
00:54:27,116 --> 00:54:27,516
I think you did.

1406
00:54:27,796 --> 00:54:28,356
No, I did not.

1407
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:29,156
I think you would have been a better,

1408
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:31,516
you had a better late 90s than we did, I wanna say.

1409
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:32,116
Yeah, probably.

1410
00:54:32,116 --> 00:54:33,396
I was pretty sure we'll look around then.

1411
00:54:33,576 --> 00:54:34,796
I was getting grumpier.

1412
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,456
Yeah, I didn't like Hunchback.

1413
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:39,536
I did not at all.

1414
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,476
No one likes Hunchback.

1415
00:54:41,556 --> 00:54:42,356
No one likes Hunchback.

1416
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:46,916
Yeah, hell fire, hell fire.

1417
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:47,496
Unpleasant.

1418
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,096
Very depressing song.

1419
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:50,916
They're too mean to that poor Hunchback.

1420
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:53,176
Why don't we start here?

1421
00:54:53,196 --> 00:54:56,456
Let's go to floor five and work our way down

1422
00:54:56,456 --> 00:55:00,036
as Sid and Marty Croft intended, and on floor five,

1423
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:01,776
I don't know, what is floor five?

1424
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:02,556
Well, it's Food Quest.

1425
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:03,596
Can I ask a question?

1426
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:03,876
It's Food Quest.

1427
00:55:04,016 --> 00:55:06,296
Let's get, let's lead up our journey.

1428
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,336
Food Quest is, from what I can tell,

1429
00:55:08,336 --> 00:55:09,596
maybe you guys did better research.

1430
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:12,976
The only Cheesecake Factory Express that ever existed

1431
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,376
was in Food Quest.

1432
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,796
Potentially, it was mostly a freezer case

1433
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:18,136
of Cheesecake Factory.

1434
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:20,956
But they also had cheese steaks, I read.

1435
00:55:22,016 --> 00:55:23,636
It was also a cheese steak factory?

1436
00:55:23,736 --> 00:55:25,296
There was a cheese steak factory as well.

1437
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:27,096
They could just take the cheese from the cake

1438
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:28,636
and put it over on a sandwich.

1439
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:30,096
There was food and people, like, there were,

1440
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:31,916
I mean, you know, the Cheesecake Factory

1441
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,016
has a bevy of options.

1442
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,096
A giant menu. A giant menu.

1443
00:55:34,196 --> 00:55:34,716
As did this place.

1444
00:55:34,776 --> 00:55:36,796
There was also something called the Wonderland Cafe.

1445
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:40,236
Well, the Wonderland Cafe was the Cheesecake Factory.

1446
00:55:40,356 --> 00:55:41,436
Oh, it changed.

1447
00:55:42,396 --> 00:55:44,756
Or I think, I saw a picture that said

1448
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:46,656
the Cheesecake Factory Express logo

1449
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:49,496
and then it said Wonderland Cafe.

1450
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:52,336
And there was another thing too.

1451
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:54,876
Here's one thing I know is that the Wonderland Cafe

1452
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:57,076
had a big blocky font that says Cafe

1453
00:55:57,076 --> 00:56:00,656
and then on top of that, hand scribbled Cafe

1454
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:03,276
on top, writing on top of the other.

1455
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:05,896
So where Cafe is written twice, one on top of the other,

1456
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:09,196
that's that kind of aesthetic shit that makes me upset.

1457
00:56:09,196 --> 00:56:12,156
It gives me a headache as we talk about it.

1458
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:14,736
No good. But Cheesecake Factory Express.

1459
00:56:15,096 --> 00:56:18,636
Did it look good from the, I don't know,

1460
00:56:18,896 --> 00:56:22,276
from your vague catching of it in B-roll?

1461
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:23,956
You think, I mean, is it a good spot?

1462
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:25,576
It looked like that probably the cheesecake

1463
00:56:25,576 --> 00:56:26,676
was probably delicious.

1464
00:56:26,776 --> 00:56:28,576
It probably was. Yeah, everything else,

1465
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,396
whatever it was, whether it was connected

1466
00:56:30,396 --> 00:56:31,356
to the Wonderland Cafe.

1467
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:32,596
What was the other thing called?

1468
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:34,056
There was like, it was a food court,

1469
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:34,996
essentially a food court.

1470
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:39,016
So it was like two or three stalls that you went up to.

1471
00:56:39,156 --> 00:56:40,476
And then eventually it all got.

1472
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:42,456
Steamer trays of pizza and pasta and that sort of stuff.

1473
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:44,816
Yeah, then it all just got named Burgers, Dogs and Raps

1474
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:46,216
and Pizza, Pasta and Panini.

1475
00:56:46,256 --> 00:56:49,096
And whenever the deal with the Cheesecake Factory was done,

1476
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:51,396
the food apparently got markedly worse.

1477
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:55,836
So this miserable arcade is rotting and losing games

1478
00:56:55,836 --> 00:56:58,756
and the food has gotten much, much more unpleasant.

1479
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,576
So that's where we're starting.

1480
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:04,316
But from there, what zone is, I think,

1481
00:57:04,316 --> 00:57:05,836
I think it's the score zone.

1482
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:07,776
Yeah, let's go to the score zone.

1483
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:11,416
Because the top floor of this building had exactly,

1484
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:13,396
it's crazy that I did not go there

1485
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:17,536
because it had my two interests in the late 90s exactly.

1486
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:20,156
Comic books and alien encounter shit.

1487
00:57:20,476 --> 00:57:22,136
All right, let's go in the order you said.

1488
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:24,536
Ride the comics with an X. Ride the comics.

1489
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:28,036
This one is the, this is the one I'm so interested, like.

1490
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:29,896
I want. I didn't do this, actually.

1491
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:31,076
What was it?

1492
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:33,496
It was a VR, this was one of the VR things.

1493
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,436
So you're putting on the big blocky helmet

1494
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:39,896
and in it you are doing battle with comic book characters.

1495
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:41,816
And it seems like you have like a little rod

1496
00:57:41,816 --> 00:57:43,456
that ends up serving as a sword.

1497
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:44,496
It was a laser sword.

1498
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:46,296
It's a laser sword. It's a laser sword.

1499
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:50,136
And you're fighting against not Disney character.

1500
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:51,716
They're kind of like a made up,

1501
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:54,216
they feel like the villains from Nick Arcade,

1502
00:57:54,456 --> 00:57:57,296
where they're reminiscent of what real characters

1503
00:57:57,296 --> 00:57:58,776
from a comic or video game would be,

1504
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:00,616
but you've never heard of them until right now.

1505
00:58:00,696 --> 00:58:03,056
Yeah, you're fighting against, you know,

1506
00:58:03,176 --> 00:58:05,176
Miss Skinner and the devil dogs.

1507
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:10,096
You're fighting against the Toymaker.

1508
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:14,776
You're fighting against Mistress Khan and Z-Bub.

1509
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:15,996
So play on BLZubub.

1510
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:17,956
It's weird that they would call it like comics,

1511
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:19,716
but these aren't comics.

1512
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:21,796
Oh, I beg to differ, Michael.

1513
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:24,476
This was a popular 90s thing.

1514
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:25,576
Don't you remember?

1515
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:27,676
Oh, you mean like Comic Zone and stuff?

1516
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:29,356
Yeah, like Comic Zone and the.

1517
00:58:29,356 --> 00:58:30,916
That's dumb too, though, I'm saying.

1518
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:32,616
Yeah, it was just.

1519
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:34,696
But you know what makes that different

1520
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:36,576
is that that had a whole aesthetic in the,

1521
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:38,936
we're talking about Comic Zone, a Sega Genesis game.

1522
00:58:39,256 --> 00:58:40,576
Oh. Available for iOS.

1523
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:42,456
Is that right? Yeah, I have it on my phone.

1524
00:58:42,456 --> 00:58:42,956
Oh, that's fun.

1525
00:58:43,196 --> 00:58:45,856
But that used, that had a whole mechanism

1526
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,036
that you would go to different levels

1527
00:58:47,036 --> 00:58:49,336
by turning the page, and it was like a whole,

1528
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:50,556
it set the whole thing up.

1529
00:58:50,576 --> 00:58:52,056
You're inside a comic book,

1530
00:58:52,216 --> 00:58:54,976
and that's a big part of the play mechanics.

1531
00:58:55,556 --> 00:58:58,776
This, yeah, all this stuff is just like

1532
00:58:58,776 --> 00:58:59,956
they made up characters and they're like,

1533
00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:02,056
this is a comic, but it's not a comic.

1534
00:59:02,056 --> 00:59:02,596
It's just aesthetics.

1535
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,696
It's just the aesthetics of 90s,

1536
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:08,816
like hyper stylized, hyper violent comics.

1537
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:12,176
What if you were, what if you strapped on a helmet

1538
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:17,816
and you got to do battle with the X-Men except unbranded

1539
00:59:17,816 --> 00:59:20,256
and rendered in a less memorable fashion?

1540
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,816
And also they are not comics, they are not flat.

1541
00:59:22,996 --> 00:59:24,896
They are CGI characters.

1542
00:59:25,056 --> 00:59:27,096
So the characters you saw on the sign on the way in

1543
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,196
are not who you are fighting.

1544
00:59:28,256 --> 00:59:30,976
That's what Ride the Comics is.

1545
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:33,796
I Ride the Comics follows the find

1546
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:37,116
early video game tradition of the box art

1547
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,916
being more interesting than the game itself.

1548
00:59:40,096 --> 00:59:41,236
Oh yeah, yeah.

1549
00:59:41,236 --> 00:59:43,756
The ET video game tradition.

1550
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:46,476
I'm trying to figure out,

1551
00:59:46,476 --> 00:59:48,496
because I was trying to zoom in on these pictures,

1552
00:59:48,576 --> 00:59:50,496
which I found scattered about the internet.

1553
00:59:51,516 --> 00:59:55,216
Like, did they just have artists copy the style

1554
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,796
of like image of like Jim Lee, Mark Silvestri type of comics,

1555
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:00,876
or did they commission them to do this?

1556
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,356
Because the one thing that's missing

1557
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:03,936
from these kinds of comics, these drawings

1558
01:00:03,936 --> 01:00:06,016
is a little artist signature in the corner,

1559
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,256
which I'm sure Disney is like.

1560
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:08,436
They made them sign away.

1561
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:10,396
Or the people didn't want to do it.

1562
01:00:10,516 --> 01:00:11,896
Maybe they did it anonymously.

1563
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:13,056
Yeah, they could have.

1564
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:14,996
But I mean, it looks like.

1565
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:16,856
You showed them to me yesterday.

1566
01:00:17,056 --> 01:00:18,896
They look like Mark Silvestri drawings,

1567
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:20,196
if you know who that is.

1568
01:00:20,276 --> 01:00:21,596
He's a comic guy, you know?

1569
01:00:21,636 --> 01:00:22,136
Yeah.

1570
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:25,916
And and and I would say like the style of the time,

1571
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,396
but that style never really went away in comics.

1572
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:32,096
Like Jim Lee still sells a ton of comics when he draws a comic.

1573
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:32,716
So, sure.

1574
01:00:33,456 --> 01:00:35,676
Yeah, very generic.

1575
01:00:36,016 --> 01:00:39,216
Like, but again, I probably would have been very.

1576
01:00:39,256 --> 01:00:41,816
I was a sucker for anything branded comics.

1577
01:00:42,016 --> 01:00:42,676
Let me say this.

1578
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:46,636
I we were so confused by the layout of this place, too.

1579
01:00:46,716 --> 01:00:49,236
I don't think I knew this existed in there.

1580
01:00:49,256 --> 01:00:50,736
And I think we missed it somehow.

1581
01:00:50,736 --> 01:00:52,436
Yeah, I didn't go anywhere near this.

1582
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,916
Like I yeah, if this was hidden, maybe.

1583
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:58,456
And I was obviously like comic comics with an X.

1584
01:00:58,476 --> 01:00:59,996
That's all you had to say to me at that age.

1585
01:00:59,996 --> 01:01:01,436
And I would have been like, yes, please.

1586
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:05,316
Well, they was located on the inside all of the spaceships

1587
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:08,176
that were jutting out over the the the atrium.

1588
01:01:08,516 --> 01:01:10,916
So, you know, the comic characters live in the spaceships.

1589
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,356
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

1590
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:16,296
Now that you say it in the score zone, Mike, get with the program.

1591
01:01:16,316 --> 01:01:17,256
The score zone.

1592
01:01:17,816 --> 01:01:20,436
And you're like writing like you're what you say.

1593
01:01:20,436 --> 01:01:23,816
I was going to say it is funny that they use the X

1594
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:27,736
because like X got used as a lot of like extreme shit in the 90s.

1595
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:31,476
But in terms of comic book, like the spelling with comics

1596
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:36,256
usually refers to like the alt comics like your Art Spiegelman,

1597
01:01:36,396 --> 01:01:39,776
Dan Clowes, Robert Crumb sort of world of comics.

1598
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:42,176
That is not at all this world of comics.

1599
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:43,656
Was a Robert Crumb

1600
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:46,756
V.R. right now would be now I'm interested.

1601
01:01:47,376 --> 01:01:47,896
Jesus.

1602
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:52,716
It's like a Fritz the cat style VR experience.

1603
01:01:52,736 --> 01:01:57,336
What about is there like a leisure suit, Larry V.R. these days?

1604
01:01:57,336 --> 01:01:59,696
Oh, someone's got to be working on that.

1605
01:01:59,876 --> 01:02:00,456
Right. Right.

1606
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:03,996
Do you leisure shoot leisure suit Larry where it was like a dirty game,

1607
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,136
but like nothing ever happened.

1608
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:06,216
Did you ever play that? No.

1609
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:06,976
You know, I'm talking about.

1610
01:02:07,036 --> 01:02:11,336
No, I was like a pervy cartoon man and you would play a computer game

1611
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:14,616
and he would like go talk to girls and like bathing suits.

1612
01:02:14,616 --> 01:02:19,156
It was on like the adults only shelf at CompUSA or something.

1613
01:02:19,176 --> 01:02:21,136
Yeah. And it was a dirty game.

1614
01:02:21,756 --> 01:02:22,836
They're an adult game.

1615
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,656
It was like three dirty games.

1616
01:02:25,656 --> 01:02:29,516
Yeah. And one of the improv team we used to play on was called Leisure Suit Jason.

1617
01:02:29,896 --> 01:02:30,536
Oh, yeah.

1618
01:02:30,656 --> 01:02:35,176
So I think that was just me, you and past guest, Marissa Strickland.

1619
01:02:35,476 --> 01:02:35,876
Right. Yeah.

1620
01:02:35,876 --> 01:02:37,996
And she used a childhood photo of you to promote it.

1621
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:39,936
And it's my favorite picture I've ever seen.

1622
01:02:39,976 --> 01:02:41,716
Let's post that. We will post it.

1623
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:42,356
Ride the comics.

1624
01:02:42,636 --> 01:02:43,816
I'm looking at the video of this.

1625
01:02:43,896 --> 01:02:48,016
It's just like a guy on a jet ski and you're just like wiggling a thing.

1626
01:02:48,956 --> 01:02:51,356
You're like wiggling a laser sword.

1627
01:02:51,656 --> 01:02:55,936
And one of those watching a bunch of dads do this and pretend to enjoy it

1628
01:02:55,936 --> 01:02:58,156
and pretend they know how to do it.

1629
01:02:58,396 --> 01:02:59,956
You put my dad in this thing.

1630
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,496
It's a disaster. Yeah.

1631
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:05,856
And now like dads these days, if we were dads, we'd kind of know how to do it

1632
01:03:05,856 --> 01:03:07,476
because we grew up on video games and stuff.

1633
01:03:07,516 --> 01:03:11,616
But yeah, I can't imagine the learning curve on the headset

1634
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:13,796
because my parents checked out at Mario one.

1635
01:03:13,796 --> 01:03:17,156
They tried to play Mario one and they did for a little bit.

1636
01:03:17,216 --> 01:03:18,616
And then I think it was like that was it.

1637
01:03:18,616 --> 01:03:19,936
They never played a game again.

1638
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:21,696
They never tried any of the other systems.

1639
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,376
Like Wii, they tried a little of the Wii.

1640
01:03:23,636 --> 01:03:24,416
They did Gwi bowling.

1641
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,276
There was a little bit.

1642
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:27,356
They almost got the parents back.

1643
01:03:27,396 --> 01:03:29,956
And I think that was a big reason that Wii sold so well.

1644
01:03:30,356 --> 01:03:31,656
But yeah, they were out.

1645
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:36,256
So, yeah, imagining now that that being said, would I like a video of my dad

1646
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:39,296
waving a laser sword at a guy on a jet ski?

1647
01:03:39,296 --> 01:03:42,836
Of course, the B-roll footage of people swinging the swords.

1648
01:03:42,836 --> 01:03:46,416
I mean, like, oh, yeah, you don't get on him.

1649
01:03:46,516 --> 01:03:48,956
You don't look cool doing VR.

1650
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:50,476
Any VR, you don't know.

1651
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,796
And those helmets are so gigantic.

1652
01:03:52,796 --> 01:04:00,036
I wish it was the like unedited B-roll where the people are obviously being coached.

1653
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,656
Like, hey, you really wave your arm more or like really here.

1654
01:04:03,656 --> 01:04:07,016
Like, because obviously, commands all of those things that people are saying

1655
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:08,916
and exclaiming are so unnatural.

1656
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:11,096
Yeah. So I would love the full.

1657
01:04:11,096 --> 01:04:15,256
If anyone has a copy of that fighting the toy maker, go for it.

1658
01:04:15,256 --> 01:04:16,956
Get after it. He's the toy maker.

1659
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:21,696
So number two, and this is a pretty notable thing.

1660
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:23,176
Here's here's one thing overall.

1661
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:28,076
I would like to say about Disney Quest and something I think is admirable about it

1662
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:33,156
and sort of presaging the future is that this was a weird instance

1663
01:04:33,156 --> 01:04:37,596
of trying to take properties from the parks and do other things with them.

1664
01:04:37,596 --> 01:04:40,256
As we'll get into, there was a Pirates of the Caribbean thing.

1665
01:04:40,256 --> 01:04:41,456
There was a Jungle Cruise thing.

1666
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:43,016
There was a Space Mountain thing.

1667
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:49,636
And we have here up in the score zone, the other iteration of beloved attraction,

1668
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:52,316
extraterrestrial alien encounter.

1669
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:56,276
But it's specifically called Invasion, an extraterrestrial alien encounter.

1670
01:04:56,596 --> 01:04:57,396
Yes. Yes.

1671
01:04:58,316 --> 01:05:01,136
Colonists on a planet are being attacked by aliens.

1672
01:05:01,736 --> 01:05:06,516
Earth needs to enlist the help of Chairman Clench and access tech.

1673
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:07,936
It's so ideal.

1674
01:05:07,936 --> 01:05:09,136
You have here.

1675
01:05:09,436 --> 01:05:11,856
Sexual predator Jeffrey Jones is back.

1676
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:13,636
He's back. Our favorite creep.

1677
01:05:14,676 --> 01:05:17,656
Yeah, this is the other piece of media containing

1678
01:05:17,656 --> 01:05:20,936
original alien encounter character Chairman Clench.

1679
01:05:21,176 --> 01:05:24,676
And he holds a joint press conference

1680
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:29,176
with the president of the United States, Joseph Reed.

1681
01:05:29,776 --> 01:05:33,256
I love generic presidents and things,

1682
01:05:33,256 --> 01:05:37,296
especially as we as a society step very far away

1683
01:05:37,296 --> 01:05:39,436
from just like a dull man in a suit.

1684
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:40,256
And that's the president.

1685
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:42,576
The president's name is Mark Morris.

1686
01:05:42,876 --> 01:05:44,256
Like that never happens.

1687
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:48,896
And he but I love that's I love President Whitmore and Independence Day so much.

1688
01:05:49,056 --> 01:05:53,116
And you get President Joseph Reed and he's in Chairman Clench

1689
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,716
makeup for approximately 10 seconds of footage.

1690
01:05:57,056 --> 01:06:00,016
I wonder if they film this concurrently with Alien Encounter.

1691
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:03,016
Do they like possibly have the knowledge to know they were going to do

1692
01:06:03,016 --> 01:06:06,056
something else? But that was there's a long distance between those things.

1693
01:06:06,056 --> 01:06:07,976
I don't know. Anyway, I love President Joe.

1694
01:06:08,136 --> 01:06:09,536
That's another podcast, right?

1695
01:06:09,536 --> 01:06:12,916
Patreon promise a full episode about President Joseph Reed,

1696
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,376
a character of all of 15 seconds in fiction.

1697
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:20,796
Uh huh. This one looked the game itself, I'll say, like looks maybe fun.

1698
01:06:20,796 --> 01:06:22,956
Kind of. Yeah. Right.

1699
01:06:23,036 --> 01:06:23,876
Fun kind of.

1700
01:06:23,936 --> 01:06:26,736
I think this is among the more well received elements

1701
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:28,976
because it was like kind of just a video game.

1702
01:06:29,176 --> 01:06:32,796
Yeah. I don't we keep we were running out of time already, probably.

1703
01:06:33,296 --> 01:06:36,396
But like Gameworks was open, which is a place like Dave and Buster's.

1704
01:06:36,536 --> 01:06:39,276
And just everything in Gameworks to me at the time was like, this is awesome.

1705
01:06:39,276 --> 01:06:40,636
I want to do all of these things.

1706
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:45,476
And all of these things are so boring and not inspiring for a child.

1707
01:06:45,716 --> 01:06:49,076
And didn't and by Gameworks was a Sega property.

1708
01:06:49,316 --> 01:06:49,776
Is that correct?

1709
01:06:50,096 --> 01:06:51,496
Dave and Buster's.

1710
01:06:51,576 --> 01:06:55,776
What I'm saying is these places all had the big, good video games

1711
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:59,676
at these other indoor video game entertainment centers.

1712
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:03,616
They had like the legitimate best video games being made

1713
01:07:03,616 --> 01:07:06,996
by professional video game makers, not original weird.

1714
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,856
Disney has to conjure up all of these things from scratch.

1715
01:07:11,016 --> 01:07:14,736
Well, that came first and Disney was like, oh, we can't let them have.

1716
01:07:15,036 --> 01:07:17,736
We got to get into this entertainment sort of thing.

1717
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:22,356
Right. Theory in the defunct land video is that it was all all of this was Eisner

1718
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:24,656
trying to strike back against Katzenberg.

1719
01:07:24,656 --> 01:07:28,296
Oh, right. Right. Out of vested interest in Gameworks.

1720
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:29,896
Maybe I don't know.

1721
01:07:30,036 --> 01:07:33,496
That seems I mean, this seems like a thing Disney wanted would have wanted to do

1722
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:36,896
anyway. And as I said, it was their way to like, let's get into other cities

1723
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:41,296
without having to build a full magic kingdom in Toronto or whatever it is.

1724
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:43,416
But I don't know. Yeah, this seems fine.

1725
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:44,896
This isn't the worst thing.

1726
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:47,656
Yeah, it seems like you could enjoy playing it.

1727
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:51,456
Some level you steer the ship or you're the gunner.

1728
01:07:51,456 --> 01:07:53,056
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1729
01:07:53,076 --> 01:07:55,756
Looks like a stand-alone video game rescue colonists.

1730
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:56,956
It doesn't OK.

1731
01:07:56,956 --> 01:08:00,536
Inspiring about the like the graphics or the characters in it.

1732
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:04,956
But you know who's really excited about it is the dad in the Mandy Moore

1733
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:10,876
B roll, who is walking up to this attraction and yells, this is it, baby.

1734
01:08:11,056 --> 01:08:12,996
Amazing.

1735
01:08:13,336 --> 01:08:17,436
So that's that's that's covers the score zone, doesn't it?

1736
01:08:17,496 --> 01:08:19,456
I think we're out of the score zone already.

1737
01:08:19,456 --> 01:08:23,976
Let's get out of the score zone into the fire into the replay zone.

1738
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:27,356
Let's go down to wait.

1739
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,936
Some of the zones, this zone straddles several floors.

1740
01:08:30,936 --> 01:08:31,996
I don't know where to go next.

1741
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:33,216
Four and five.

1742
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:36,376
It was like a half score zone and half replays.

1743
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:39,856
Let's go replay midway on the moon.

1744
01:08:40,056 --> 01:08:41,616
I don't have this one.

1745
01:08:41,876 --> 01:08:42,856
Just made way on the moon.

1746
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:43,996
Looks like it's on five.

1747
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:45,716
Five. It's on both.

1748
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:47,416
Oh, it's on. I think it's a two floor arcade.

1749
01:08:47,436 --> 01:08:48,456
What the hell?

1750
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,216
Some of the attractions straddle the floor.

1751
01:08:51,216 --> 01:08:51,636
I see what you're saying.

1752
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,816
Can be more than one floor.

1753
01:08:53,956 --> 01:08:56,236
Now it does. I have I'm seeing midway on the moon as well.

1754
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:59,176
For a replay zone and they're both on the OK.

1755
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:03,696
It's a multi floor midway that's on the moon and in the score zone.

1756
01:09:03,716 --> 01:09:08,516
And on the fifth floor, it's connected by Food Quest and the Wonderland Cafe.

1757
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:12,336
And on the fourth floor, it's connected by Wonderland Web Adventures.

1758
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:17,256
A thing I'm realizing I didn't really find much out on, but I'm assuming was

1759
01:09:17,256 --> 01:09:18,616
Internet Cafe.

1760
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:19,356
Yes.

1761
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:22,956
Now, what you could do there was send an E postcard

1762
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:27,956
telling people what a good time you're having at Disney Quest on a compact computer.

1763
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:32,276
Disney Quest is full of stuff that you would just do at the end of Spaceship Earth.

1764
01:09:32,476 --> 01:09:33,876
Yes. You would just go through.

1765
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:37,416
Everything like in Epcot and stuff where you just go at the end

1766
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:40,096
and that whatever they have in at the end of Journey into Imagination

1767
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:41,176
or whatever it's called.

1768
01:09:41,476 --> 01:09:43,856
Oh, because they have that kind of thing where you let bullshit.

1769
01:09:44,176 --> 01:09:48,336
You make your eyes big and you put it seems like you could put on a little monitor.

1770
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:51,316
You put scars snout over your face.

1771
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:53,436
Yeah. And they print out a photo of that.

1772
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:55,276
It's probably miserable quality.

1773
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:57,076
Yeah. A big waste of time.

1774
01:09:57,176 --> 01:10:00,056
It's just some idea that they could like suck people into the ride

1775
01:10:00,056 --> 01:10:02,736
for an extra 10 minutes, like some number cruncher was like,

1776
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:06,656
if we keep everyone there 15 more minutes, then we'll have there.

1777
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:10,236
Like the pathways will be much more clear for the rest of the day.

1778
01:10:10,236 --> 01:10:14,036
And spend this whole thing feels like a strategy to get people out of the parks.

1779
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:17,356
Like, how can we hide people in a corner for a couple hours

1780
01:10:17,356 --> 01:10:19,716
so we reduce the line of big thunder?

1781
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:24,356
Three hours specifically, which was the estimated amount of time.

1782
01:10:24,796 --> 01:10:28,436
Yeah, they said the ideal Disney Quest experience is two to three hours,

1783
01:10:28,476 --> 01:10:31,196
which is not a lot, not a lot for thirty dollars.

1784
01:10:31,336 --> 01:10:34,656
My memory is that we were so confused how to navigate it.

1785
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:38,516
We were so confused at like the wait times that there were things

1786
01:10:38,516 --> 01:10:42,056
that seemed inaccessible that we just were so lost.

1787
01:10:42,096 --> 01:10:44,636
And we kind of wandered to a couple things.

1788
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:47,616
And we were like, I guess we did it all.

1789
01:10:47,736 --> 01:10:50,476
We were so unsure and uncertain of what was happening.

1790
01:10:50,636 --> 01:10:54,316
You missed entire things and things like I don't think I went on Cyberspace

1791
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:57,256
Mountain because you walk up to it and like, where's the line?

1792
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:00,896
And then you have to wait, get in line, I recall your own ride.

1793
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:02,096
And then, right.

1794
01:11:02,496 --> 01:11:05,416
Is this jumping around if we talk about cyberspace mountain?

1795
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,676
Who cares? Doesn't matter.

1796
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,076
From the Create Zone?

1797
01:11:08,956 --> 01:11:10,356
We might as well go to the Create Zone.

1798
01:11:10,796 --> 01:11:12,736
What zone we're in if we jump around, I think.

1799
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:15,316
OK, so now we're we'll get back to the replay zone.

1800
01:11:15,456 --> 01:11:17,956
But I will let's talk about the Create Zone zone.

1801
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:22,096
Because we had already talked about living easels in which you give yourself

1802
01:11:22,096 --> 01:11:23,436
a scar snout. Yes.

1803
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:25,496
And there's also a thing where you can make

1804
01:11:25,496 --> 01:11:30,996
the kind of Frankenstein toy that Sid from Toy Story makes,

1805
01:11:31,116 --> 01:11:33,256
where it's a bunch of toys fused together in a freakish way.

1806
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:37,596
Create a toy, which I saw one one or two websites say

1807
01:11:37,596 --> 01:11:40,756
you would create the toy and then you could buy the toy at the end.

1808
01:11:40,856 --> 01:11:43,716
I saw no proof that you could buy the toy.

1809
01:11:43,956 --> 01:11:45,236
I read that something like was broken.

1810
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:48,676
Somebody was like the toy, create a toy was broken the day I went.

1811
01:11:49,136 --> 01:11:50,976
Yeah, every day. Like every day.

1812
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:55,416
It's like the lie at McDonald's when they say the milkshake machine is broken.

1813
01:11:55,716 --> 01:11:57,656
Oh, well, that's such a that's a that happened a lot.

1814
01:11:58,176 --> 01:12:00,856
I've had happen, you know, 10 times probably in my life.

1815
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:03,476
And it's always at 1am or it's always at 12.

1816
01:12:03,976 --> 01:12:05,356
I don't want to. Oh, yeah, it's not working.

1817
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:08,516
It's not working. And it's always like you can tell he's like the kid is lying.

1818
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:11,016
This disc just getting lazy.

1819
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:12,476
So there's that.

1820
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:17,136
But then the big thing that you can create is your own rollercoaster.

1821
01:12:17,256 --> 01:12:20,076
I'm sick of Space Mountain telling me what to do.

1822
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:22,256
It's a new era. It's the digital era.

1823
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,876
I want a cyber space mountain.

1824
01:12:25,316 --> 01:12:28,916
So this is we just I feel like there must be listeners who don't know this,

1825
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:31,956
that there's a thing called Cyber Space Mountain.

1826
01:12:32,156 --> 01:12:36,056
And you get in a line to stand at a computer and you pick out

1827
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:37,696
the pieces of your track.

1828
01:12:38,196 --> 01:12:41,636
People were seemingly fond of this attraction a little bit.

1829
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:45,316
This is the roller coaster tycoon fondness.

1830
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:49,656
Right. It's like making a roller coaster tycoon ride that you you can actually ride.

1831
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:54,856
And your host for this experience is Bill Nye, the science.

1832
01:12:54,856 --> 01:12:58,116
Why wouldn't it be the coaster guy?

1833
01:12:58,536 --> 01:13:02,396
Is this he does say, Bill Nye, the coaster guy.

1834
01:13:02,396 --> 01:13:03,316
Oh, man.

1835
01:13:03,316 --> 01:13:08,256
I got to say, I was impressed by how much you could customize a coaster.

1836
01:13:09,256 --> 01:13:12,796
Sure. Because they would have had to program all those.

1837
01:13:12,896 --> 01:13:17,096
That you can immediately go on a thing that you built and in a good idea.

1838
01:13:17,096 --> 01:13:18,716
Yeah. That's pretty advanced.

1839
01:13:18,816 --> 01:13:22,856
This was a like it's like a little mini simulator, just two people

1840
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:27,696
that flips around, it goes upside down and then it seems like I saw

1841
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:32,216
actual ride video, non posed, non Mandy Moore ride video

1842
01:13:32,216 --> 01:13:37,416
where people were having a good time and you see people's hair go upside down.

1843
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:41,456
And but we should say this is different than the roller

1844
01:13:41,456 --> 01:13:45,376
designed and ride your own roller coaster in a in inventions

1845
01:13:45,376 --> 01:13:49,396
that lasted for a while called the sum of all thrills.

1846
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:50,516
Really? What was that?

1847
01:13:50,596 --> 01:13:52,936
That was there when I was there in 2014.

1848
01:13:53,176 --> 01:13:54,216
There was the same idea.

1849
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:55,236
You would get an idea.

1850
01:13:55,316 --> 01:13:57,096
Looked like the same technology.

1851
01:13:57,096 --> 01:13:59,776
Oh, I don't remember that might have been a kooka arm.

1852
01:13:59,956 --> 01:14:01,956
Somewhat. Maybe it was a kooka arm.

1853
01:14:01,956 --> 01:14:05,556
It was well, but it was the same thing as this simulator.

1854
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:07,556
Yeah, I don't even remember that.

1855
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,636
It was a roller coaster.

1856
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:14,876
We did go on Cyberspace Mountain and I remember being like, OK, pretty fun.

1857
01:14:14,976 --> 01:14:18,536
I think we went upside down maybe once and it was fine.

1858
01:14:18,616 --> 01:14:22,996
I think the graphics are still like like, again, they're like

1859
01:14:22,996 --> 01:14:26,216
not as good as what you have in home and your video game.

1860
01:14:26,376 --> 01:14:31,936
Well, in 1998, potentially it is up to snuff with what you have at home.

1861
01:14:32,256 --> 01:14:35,496
Maybe maybe by a year later, it is not right.

1862
01:14:35,496 --> 01:14:38,416
This PlayStation 2 is better than anything here.

1863
01:14:38,756 --> 01:14:40,596
GameCube is in every iteration.

1864
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:45,216
So it only gets exponentially worse every year that this thing was open up through 2017.

1865
01:14:45,316 --> 01:14:47,536
Ninety eight has like GoldenEye.

1866
01:14:48,056 --> 01:14:50,116
Mm hmm. So so better looking than GoldenEye,

1867
01:14:50,136 --> 01:14:52,656
but no one likes any of this more than GoldenEye.

1868
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:54,836
No, GoldenEye. Yeah.

1869
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:57,376
But you do again.

1870
01:14:57,436 --> 01:14:59,156
Space map, boring space mountain.

1871
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:00,636
They just take me to space.

1872
01:15:00,636 --> 01:15:01,816
Where even am I?

1873
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:03,416
It's not named where you are.

1874
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,736
I want mythology.

1875
01:15:05,016 --> 01:15:08,596
And that's why Bill Nye tells you your space

1876
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:12,376
mountain experience can take you either to Moltonia, which is hot,

1877
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:19,916
Broopa, Broopa, which is cold and Grumba 12, which is moderate.

1878
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:23,236
I don't know. One for Grumba 12, please.

1879
01:15:24,156 --> 01:15:28,036
Jason wants a one way ticket to Grumba 12.

1880
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:29,896
Leave me there tonight.

1881
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:32,736
You have a summer home.

1882
01:15:33,816 --> 01:15:35,976
I summer in Grumba 12.

1883
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:38,476
Me and Sherman Clinch are going to go hang in Grumba.

1884
01:15:38,516 --> 01:15:41,076
No, don't. Jason, no.

1885
01:15:41,196 --> 01:15:44,296
Standing on the edge of my dock in Grumba 12,

1886
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:47,436
looking at the green light across the way at the house.

1887
01:15:48,316 --> 01:15:50,956
Slowly, we move on boats in a current.

1888
01:15:52,156 --> 01:15:53,916
You write novels in Grumba 12.

1889
01:15:54,436 --> 01:15:56,076
The Hemingway of Grumba 12.

1890
01:15:56,576 --> 01:16:02,116
You watch the four moons of Grumba 12 set each night, each dusk.

1891
01:16:02,636 --> 01:16:04,836
And there's a magic mirror where you mess up your own eyes.

1892
01:16:04,956 --> 01:16:06,716
It's like photo booth filters.

1893
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:08,836
And that's the great zone.

1894
01:16:09,076 --> 01:16:09,776
Yeah, hold on.

1895
01:16:09,796 --> 01:16:11,536
We got to talk about the magic mirror thing.

1896
01:16:11,576 --> 01:16:16,656
They eventually it's the magic mirror surrounded a giant Pinocchio head.

1897
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:22,116
Yeah. But eventually they took out the magic mirrors

1898
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:27,556
and put in a seating so you could just sit next to a giant,

1899
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:31,296
like six foot by six foot Pinocchio head.

1900
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:34,716
Unwrapped, lingering behind your wrench.

1901
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:37,096
You're bad at it.

1902
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:38,856
It looks so unnerving.

1903
01:16:39,176 --> 01:16:41,936
Feel what Geppetto feels after Pinocchio leaves the house

1904
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:46,276
and only can think about is his lost boy over his shoulder in his brain.

1905
01:16:46,556 --> 01:16:47,356
A new dimension of horror.

1906
01:16:48,816 --> 01:16:49,456
My boy.

1907
01:16:50,576 --> 01:16:52,656
Um, so that's that.

1908
01:16:52,656 --> 01:16:56,196
Here, let's backtrack over to the replay zone.

1909
01:16:56,316 --> 01:16:58,216
Why replay? What do you mean?

1910
01:16:58,636 --> 01:17:00,476
The other ones are replays.

1911
01:17:00,676 --> 01:17:04,496
So the yeah, I know this will replay is on.

1912
01:17:04,656 --> 01:17:08,216
OK, so replay is five, four and three levels, five, four and three.

1913
01:17:08,296 --> 01:17:09,636
And it's like a lot of.

1914
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:14,456
Yeah. So on my map of Disney Quest, you guys have.

1915
01:17:14,556 --> 01:17:15,496
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1916
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:18,996
And three all have replay zones and it's all like the right side of the building.

1917
01:17:18,996 --> 01:17:20,856
And three also all have score zones.

1918
01:17:21,356 --> 01:17:24,016
Yes. So score zone is also on five, four and three as well.

1919
01:17:24,116 --> 01:17:25,136
The other hand, those are blue.

1920
01:17:25,136 --> 01:17:28,156
OK, so that left side of my map, those are blue.

1921
01:17:28,196 --> 01:17:31,056
So the score zones are blue and the red are the replay zones.

1922
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:35,336
So this zone straddle the levels and one floor can be more than one zone.

1923
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:36,396
Right. What are you getting?

1924
01:17:36,956 --> 01:17:38,916
I take the cyber later to get there.

1925
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:39,936
You take the cell.

1926
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:45,316
You're seemingly if you go up, if you eventually go all the way up,

1927
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:49,456
like there's a lot of stuff on one and two you want to do there.

1928
01:17:49,476 --> 01:17:54,036
OK, so let's I guess let's talk about Buzz Lightyear, Astro Blaster,

1929
01:17:54,276 --> 01:17:56,576
singular, singular, Astro Blaster.

1930
01:17:56,576 --> 01:17:58,976
And it's not the ride.

1931
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:01,756
It's not the right now from the parks.

1932
01:18:02,256 --> 01:18:04,536
It's something else. But this I like.

1933
01:18:04,936 --> 01:18:07,396
Yes, this is cool. I didn't do it.

1934
01:18:07,396 --> 01:18:08,836
I don't remember why.

1935
01:18:09,136 --> 01:18:10,896
Probably a long line.

1936
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:14,556
There's a bunch of no good Knicks who were wanted, you know,

1937
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:18,056
who would have bumped you and throw cannonballs at you extra.

1938
01:18:18,056 --> 01:18:20,696
Yeah, these were like soup.

1939
01:18:21,016 --> 01:18:22,896
Something that fire in here.

1940
01:18:23,796 --> 01:18:24,836
Somebody smell like fire.

1941
01:18:24,996 --> 01:18:25,996
I smell food.

1942
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:28,756
OK, it's probably next door then. Sorry.

1943
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:30,936
Thanks. So we'll keep it.

1944
01:18:31,096 --> 01:18:32,116
Just keep your nose up.

1945
01:18:32,136 --> 01:18:35,656
I think it's probably just probably food coming through. But I think so.

1946
01:18:35,856 --> 01:18:38,296
Like at first I'd be like, is that steak?

1947
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,536
And then I was like, wait, no, that's OK.

1948
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:41,676
Anyway, that's pretty Bernie.

1949
01:18:42,236 --> 01:18:43,936
But Bernie. Well, OK.

1950
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:49,056
So Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster glorified bumper cars with cannons on them

1951
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:52,896
that would shoot like foam balls at other cars.

1952
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:54,516
Yeah, this is fun.

1953
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:57,756
This looks like some game show, some fun.

1954
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:01,016
Never made Nickelodeon show or some high concept.

1955
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:04,276
Like there's there's a lot like to like about this.

1956
01:19:04,296 --> 01:19:06,796
Just really aesthetically something. Yeah.

1957
01:19:06,836 --> 01:19:09,796
And you fire the cannonballs cannonball.

1958
01:19:09,836 --> 01:19:12,276
What is it? Asteroid mini?

1959
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,416
That's space rocks.

1960
01:19:13,596 --> 01:19:14,116
I don't know.

1961
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:18,476
You fire them at a little splat on the side of your opponent's cars.

1962
01:19:18,476 --> 01:19:22,116
And if you hit the target, their car spins around.

1963
01:19:22,536 --> 01:19:23,296
But that's cool.

1964
01:19:23,876 --> 01:19:25,296
A very small room.

1965
01:19:25,816 --> 01:19:27,216
Yeah, it looks so small.

1966
01:19:27,456 --> 01:19:29,716
I'm sure that's why we didn't go on it, because it was so small.

1967
01:19:29,796 --> 01:19:31,996
And like the right capacity had to be terrible.

1968
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:34,096
And cars look like they could barely move.

1969
01:19:34,196 --> 01:19:37,216
I mean, bumper cars, you need space to like move.

1970
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:39,516
Yeah. And they're not going particularly fast.

1971
01:19:39,656 --> 01:19:40,596
They're going very slow.

1972
01:19:41,116 --> 01:19:43,256
Everyone's clumped up and spinning.

1973
01:19:43,656 --> 01:19:46,076
Yeah. So in theory, it's a cool idea.

1974
01:19:46,316 --> 01:19:51,476
Idea. But yeah, it looks like a like an electric football game.

1975
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:54,816
Like where they all like kind of goes around and fall over.

1976
01:19:54,996 --> 01:19:56,336
It's this pathetic little display.

1977
01:19:56,596 --> 01:19:59,116
They aren't evenly spread out amongst the field.

1978
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:02,136
They all like all stay in a corner and spin. Right.

1979
01:20:02,576 --> 01:20:03,776
Yeah, it's weird.

1980
01:20:04,156 --> 01:20:05,496
It's pretty it's pretty dopey.

1981
01:20:05,576 --> 01:20:09,576
But I bet of all the things we can hear, maybe we can establish it.

1982
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:11,356
Let's let's at the end say what we think.

1983
01:20:11,496 --> 01:20:14,476
I did very few of the experiences, but we could say what we think.

1984
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,156
If you had to pick one, what was like the best?

1985
01:20:17,616 --> 01:20:18,696
Sure. Maybe in the running.

1986
01:20:18,936 --> 01:20:22,096
And then there's also a

1987
01:20:22,096 --> 01:20:26,516
video game, like an arcade area called the underground.

1988
01:20:26,796 --> 01:20:32,756
And it looks like where Chris O'Donnell in whichever Batman this is

1989
01:20:32,756 --> 01:20:34,616
meets Coolio.

1990
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,056
It's like it's that level forever.

1991
01:20:38,256 --> 01:20:39,676
Right. Yeah, forever.

1992
01:20:39,676 --> 01:20:44,136
But that's how that's the kind of underground it seems like to me.

1993
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:46,256
Like it's edgy for a 13 year old.

1994
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:50,036
Yeah. Now you're now I'm stuck on which where's Coolio, which movie?

1995
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,176
I think he might be in Batman and Robin, right?

1996
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:54,576
There's similar sequences in there.

1997
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:56,636
That's what I'm misremembering.

1998
01:20:56,816 --> 01:21:01,176
With the weird the the Gotham, like underground street racing scene.

1999
01:21:01,296 --> 01:21:04,176
Hold on. I just found a rumor I've never heard before

2000
01:21:04,176 --> 01:21:06,996
from Hollywood Reporter 2017.

2001
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:11,436
Coolio was courted to play Scarecrow in scrapped Batman and Robin sequel.

2002
01:21:11,676 --> 01:21:15,016
So you ever heard that has been courted to play Scarecrow?

2003
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:16,156
And then we've heard Jeff Goldblum.

2004
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:20,416
I have never heard Coolio courted to play Scarecrow courted.

2005
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:21,756
They were trying.

2006
01:21:22,456 --> 01:21:24,596
This is Hollywood Reporter was courted.

2007
01:21:24,596 --> 01:21:29,036
This is not like a comic book fan site from 1999.

2008
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:32,196
His hair is exactly like a scarecrow's hair.

2009
01:21:32,456 --> 01:21:34,076
How could any other actor do it?

2010
01:21:34,076 --> 01:21:39,216
Someone get me Coolio's bleeping people on the phone now, Roger.

2011
01:21:39,596 --> 01:21:41,736
It was Batman and Robin Coolio's in.

2012
01:21:42,056 --> 01:21:42,276
All right.

2013
01:21:42,276 --> 01:21:47,056
So after that and that the way he landed, the force he was in that film,

2014
01:21:47,356 --> 01:21:50,016
you want to yeah, you want to give him the lead in the next one.

2015
01:21:50,236 --> 01:21:50,656
For sure.

2016
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:54,716
I think actually speaking, I think Mr.

2017
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,476
Mr. Free is Schwarzenegger's Mr.

2018
01:21:56,596 --> 01:21:59,036
Free's, I think drives around a little weird ice buggy.

2019
01:21:59,036 --> 01:22:02,096
Yes, kind of like the Buzz Lightyear, Astro Blaster cars.

2020
01:22:02,196 --> 01:22:02,756
Yeah, that's true.

2021
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:03,656
I think that's right.

2022
01:22:03,756 --> 01:22:04,056
That's right.

2023
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:06,116
Just a couple of spikes on the outside.

2024
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:06,716
That's fun.

2025
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:08,416
So where do we leave off?

2026
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:09,936
Are we the underground?

2027
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:10,256
The underground?

2028
01:22:10,736 --> 01:22:11,176
I don't know.

2029
01:22:11,476 --> 01:22:12,336
We're almost done with this.

2030
01:22:12,776 --> 01:22:15,256
Where's we're done with the replay zone, as far as I know.

2031
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,556
We're OK, but we can go to the score zone on level three.

2032
01:22:19,576 --> 01:22:21,156
That's in the explore zone.

2033
01:22:21,656 --> 01:22:21,996
I know.

2034
01:22:22,316 --> 01:22:23,016
It's in the score zone.

2035
01:22:23,016 --> 01:22:23,736
It's in blue.

2036
01:22:24,056 --> 01:22:25,596
It is. It's in my score zone.

2037
01:22:25,616 --> 01:22:27,376
Yeah, I think it's in the score zone.

2038
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:28,276
Oh, you're right.

2039
01:22:28,496 --> 01:22:31,636
Oh, so we I skipped way past Mighty Ducks.

2040
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:32,496
Yeah, right.

2041
01:22:32,496 --> 01:22:33,656
No, that's OK.

2042
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,736
We're getting all the arcade stuff.

2043
01:22:35,976 --> 01:22:37,376
Visitor of the Disney Quest.

2044
01:22:37,556 --> 01:22:38,936
Like all the arcade stuff,

2045
01:22:38,936 --> 01:22:41,796
they didn't seem like there was any fighting games or shooting games.

2046
01:22:41,816 --> 01:22:43,636
So I would have been disappointed by that.

2047
01:22:43,796 --> 01:22:44,916
But I like this.

2048
01:22:44,996 --> 01:22:46,616
You were shooting really funny.

2049
01:22:47,016 --> 01:22:49,736
Yeah, the shooting game is the alien encounter kind of.

2050
01:22:49,836 --> 01:22:51,196
Well, no. Oh, sorry.

2051
01:22:51,296 --> 01:22:53,336
The VR, the experiences.

2052
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:58,196
But in terms of like the midway, kind of like the the arcade arcade.

2053
01:22:58,656 --> 01:23:01,356
Oh, I see that they had seemed very like driving.

2054
01:23:02,296 --> 01:23:03,876
And mostly driving games.

2055
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:08,716
I've missed something, which is one of these dull men who ran

2056
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:13,336
Disney regional entertainment was interviewed.

2057
01:23:13,836 --> 01:23:15,316
Yes, I love it.

2058
01:23:15,556 --> 01:23:18,436
Yeah, I believe this that was this guy and he is being interviewed

2059
01:23:18,436 --> 01:23:20,356
and he's asked, what is score zone?

2060
01:23:20,376 --> 01:23:23,316
And he says it's literally competition city.

2061
01:23:23,316 --> 01:23:25,896
Literally, literally.

2062
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:27,976
It's literally a city.

2063
01:23:28,056 --> 01:23:29,956
Is it? What do you mean?

2064
01:23:29,956 --> 01:23:34,396
And then and then goes on to say, you know, such as the Mighty Ducks.

2065
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:37,256
Well, I don't remember the name of it, but he might do

2066
01:23:37,256 --> 01:23:40,616
this thing where you actually become a living pinball.

2067
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:44,016
The dream, which is like the city of Mardi Croft.

2068
01:23:44,236 --> 01:23:45,896
Yes, that is exactly what it is.

2069
01:23:45,996 --> 01:23:47,496
Indoor multi level.

2070
01:23:47,696 --> 01:23:49,456
Oh, my God. That's so strange.

2071
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:53,076
That's crazy claustrophobic pinball rides, except this one

2072
01:23:53,076 --> 01:23:54,416
in the city, Mardi Croft, right?

2073
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,616
You really are inside a pinball.

2074
01:23:56,616 --> 01:23:58,856
Yeah. And here you're just like

2075
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:00,176
you're on.

2076
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:03,236
I think you're sort of on a big joystick.

2077
01:24:03,736 --> 01:24:07,336
It's like it like pivots like a segue would, where you put your weight

2078
01:24:07,336 --> 01:24:09,116
forward or back or left or right.

2079
01:24:09,276 --> 01:24:14,276
And then you're controlling where a ball goes on a screen

2080
01:24:14,276 --> 01:24:16,016
and you're against 14 other people.

2081
01:24:16,336 --> 01:24:17,516
But you are being

2082
01:24:17,516 --> 01:24:22,816
the goalie of the Mighty Ducks is fending off the balls.

2083
01:24:22,956 --> 01:24:26,816
The goalie, whose name is Wild Wing Flash Blade.

2084
01:24:26,976 --> 01:24:29,276
Well, Wild Wing's leader, the Mighty Ducks.

2085
01:24:29,676 --> 01:24:33,796
This is, we should say, themed to the late 90s Mighty Ducks cartoon,

2086
01:24:33,996 --> 01:24:38,056
a team of adventurers who are all ducks and have hockey based powers.

2087
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:40,336
Were you into it? Yeah, you were.

2088
01:24:41,096 --> 01:24:41,916
Yeah, because I was not.

2089
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:45,156
It feels like I should have been, but I actually don't know any of them.

2090
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:47,756
I can't say any of the names like that to be funny or anything

2091
01:24:47,756 --> 01:24:48,816
like I do with other stuff.

2092
01:24:48,816 --> 01:24:50,756
I don't know anything about that Mighty Ducks cartoon.

2093
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,296
I didn't know anything about it until today.

2094
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:56,376
And I discovered one fact that I really enjoy,

2095
01:24:56,376 --> 01:24:59,916
which is that the theme song of the show was called Ducks Rock.

2096
01:25:00,276 --> 01:25:05,816
And the singer of the theme song was Mickey Thomas, singer of Starship.

2097
01:25:05,816 --> 01:25:08,796
Yeah. Singer of Elvin Bishops, Fooled Around and Fell in Love.

2098
01:25:08,796 --> 01:25:10,516
I saw him this year.

2099
01:25:10,716 --> 01:25:15,436
You saw Epcot. Epcot Center, a frequent participant

2100
01:25:15,436 --> 01:25:19,996
in theme park concert events, because now you go see Starship

2101
01:25:19,996 --> 01:25:23,136
and it's called Starship featuring Mickey Thomas.

2102
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:28,356
So this is the guy who's saying, you know, Jane and well, half of

2103
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,756
we built this city.

2104
01:25:29,756 --> 01:25:31,636
And I don't do you know them?

2105
01:25:31,856 --> 01:25:34,416
I don't want to I don't want to destroy the melody of the song

2106
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:36,796
because you might have it in your head more because you watch the show.

2107
01:25:36,936 --> 01:25:40,816
But if I could just kind of sing my favorite passage of the song,

2108
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:45,276
here come the money burning up the ice,

2109
01:25:45,876 --> 01:25:47,556
try and stop the Mighty Ducks.

2110
01:25:47,756 --> 01:25:49,456
You are going to pay the price.

2111
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,936
And then he keeps saying like Ducks Rock.

2112
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:53,876
Yeah, Ducks Rock.

2113
01:25:54,556 --> 01:25:55,996
Crazy song. That's great.

2114
01:25:56,136 --> 01:26:02,156
I will say that the 90s have the best cartoon theme songs for like late 80s,

2115
01:26:02,316 --> 01:26:05,916
early 90s, mid 90s. Fantastic theme songs these days.

2116
01:26:06,256 --> 01:26:07,396
Don't touch them.

2117
01:26:07,976 --> 01:26:09,236
It's even the bad cartoon.

2118
01:26:09,816 --> 01:26:11,056
They don't really do it anymore.

2119
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:13,276
The cartoons, though, went for it.

2120
01:26:13,296 --> 01:26:17,456
Even the terrible stuff have like very fun, interesting

2121
01:26:17,456 --> 01:26:19,376
something something to them songs.

2122
01:26:19,376 --> 01:26:22,896
It really, I think, influenced my music taste in general,

2123
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:27,336
because I like a lot of stuff that sounds like the Ducktales theme,

2124
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:29,016
because like the horn players on it,

2125
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:33,016
I got a lot of stuff I like the West and Al Jarreau and Toto and all this.

2126
01:26:33,136 --> 01:26:36,796
The ducktales. I'm trying to find more sauce so I can just be listening to

2127
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:38,896
basically the Ducktales song all day.

2128
01:26:38,956 --> 01:26:41,856
The Ducktales theme is like one of the best songs ever written.

2129
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:43,356
Really? Oh, yeah.

2130
01:26:44,016 --> 01:26:46,036
Sure. Top 50 songs ever written.

2131
01:26:46,336 --> 01:26:49,176
But it's also kind of a rip of, you know,

2132
01:26:49,256 --> 01:26:50,036
Don't Forget.

2133
01:26:50,056 --> 01:26:53,676
Don't you make my dreams come true.

2134
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:57,336
It even has woos just like so you got to talk to the couple of points for that.

2135
01:26:57,396 --> 01:26:58,016
Can I say something?

2136
01:26:58,316 --> 01:27:00,436
I think it's add them as writers to it and we're on the clear.

2137
01:27:00,836 --> 01:27:03,376
Oh, yeah. They should have added credit and then it's fine.

2138
01:27:03,376 --> 01:27:04,796
It's also karmic.

2139
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:08,616
Oh, wait, no, this was also Michael Jackson at the We Are The World Recording said,

2140
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:10,316
hey, sorry, I kind of bit.

2141
01:27:11,176 --> 01:27:14,776
I can't go for that for Billy Jean. Right. Right.

2142
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:17,296
Yeah. So they're getting they're getting ripped off left and right.

2143
01:27:17,296 --> 01:27:18,876
All in notes, better lawyers.

2144
01:27:19,796 --> 01:27:23,856
It is crazy to me that there was a I guess you'd call it an attraction

2145
01:27:23,856 --> 01:27:27,076
about the short lived Mighty Ducks cartoon,

2146
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:32,476
which also done in conjunction with Disney briefly owning the hockey team.

2147
01:27:32,636 --> 01:27:34,336
Well, they started the hockey team.

2148
01:27:34,456 --> 01:27:35,816
Wait, they started it. Yeah.

2149
01:27:35,816 --> 01:27:38,736
And they built the pond, which is now on the floor.

2150
01:27:39,036 --> 01:27:41,776
And for yeah, it was Eisner's idea.

2151
01:27:41,776 --> 01:27:46,116
And I found just the beginning it was it was behind the Atlantic paywall.

2152
01:27:46,116 --> 01:27:47,136
So I didn't go.

2153
01:27:47,296 --> 01:27:48,876
Hey, thanks for being behind our paywall.

2154
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:52,936
Please, if you're subscribing to the Atlantic, cancel it and stick with us.

2155
01:27:52,936 --> 01:27:53,896
Yeah, there's so much.

2156
01:27:54,156 --> 01:27:55,356
I'm a little bit of a wall.

2157
01:27:55,356 --> 01:27:57,716
God, yeah, the Atlantic's full of crap.

2158
01:27:57,956 --> 01:27:58,696
Oh, yeah. Garbage.

2159
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:03,076
And plus I can read you the free paragraph before the paywall

2160
01:28:03,076 --> 01:28:04,716
behind this paywall.

2161
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:08,836
Eisner apparently just like in that he said out of like,

2162
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:11,436
I wanted to start a hockey team to be a good neighbor.

2163
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:13,616
I was thinking about the city of Anon.

2164
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:15,156
What can we do?

2165
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,376
Can we help the spirit of Anaheim?

2166
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:21,156
And they built this and it was all synergy because they had the movie

2167
01:28:21,156 --> 01:28:22,776
and a cartoon film, the Mighty Deck.

2168
01:28:22,816 --> 01:28:24,776
Well, the cartoon came after the.

2169
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:25,996
Oh, it did. It did.

2170
01:28:26,276 --> 01:28:30,696
And this is a show that has like space stuff.

2171
01:28:31,096 --> 01:28:34,176
It has like warlords and magic amulets.

2172
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:36,996
It's got a. However, also,

2173
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:41,936
the base of it still is the pond of Anaheim.

2174
01:28:42,136 --> 01:28:43,456
There are. I did not know.

2175
01:28:43,856 --> 01:28:47,636
That's crazy building that is literally in Anaheim.

2176
01:28:47,716 --> 01:28:53,036
And while refer to Anaheim in the show, I looked up really.

2177
01:28:53,336 --> 01:28:58,276
Yeah. Anaheim exists in my space cartoon, which also partially is set

2178
01:28:58,276 --> 01:28:59,896
in a place called Puck World.

2179
01:28:59,896 --> 01:29:03,876
Yes, actually set in Anaheim and a character named Mindbender

2180
01:29:03,876 --> 01:29:07,096
says the line My Ingenious New Thermal Bomb

2181
01:29:07,096 --> 01:29:09,956
will turn Anaheim into Hollandaise sauce.

2182
01:29:09,976 --> 01:29:11,776
Wow, that's awesome. Jason's.

2183
01:29:11,776 --> 01:29:12,856
That's. I mean.

2184
01:29:14,276 --> 01:29:20,296
I like it. I think I should mention their gunshot hockey pucks.

2185
01:29:20,296 --> 01:29:22,656
Or actually buck.

2186
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:26,536
Wild Wings, like he had wrist blasters that shot hockey pucks.

2187
01:29:26,856 --> 01:29:28,316
Do you know and can you name

2188
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:32,156
Wild Wings brother also of the Flashblade family?

2189
01:29:32,736 --> 01:29:36,636
I think he was the thief who had like a grappling hook and a sword.

2190
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:40,436
And I cannot, but I can picture him was Nose Dive.

2191
01:29:40,436 --> 01:29:42,556
And I would know maybe that was someone else.

2192
01:29:42,556 --> 01:29:46,136
And then there was a character whose his actual name.

2193
01:29:46,316 --> 01:29:49,616
And I don't know his name, but he the character was voiced by Dennis Frans.

2194
01:29:49,736 --> 01:29:52,556
And he was the police chief of Anaheim.

2195
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:53,496
That's so good.

2196
01:29:53,616 --> 01:29:55,116
I did not know any of this.

2197
01:29:55,316 --> 01:30:00,176
So weird. I didn't realize even to that that the team starts in 93.

2198
01:30:00,536 --> 01:30:03,316
That's why I was getting all screwed up with my first film.

2199
01:30:03,316 --> 01:30:05,696
Right. Because I didn't realize it was that fast.

2200
01:30:05,716 --> 01:30:08,976
And by the time they did the second film, they were able to use

2201
01:30:08,976 --> 01:30:13,056
the first thing that ever happened in the pond slash today, the Honda Center

2202
01:30:13,056 --> 01:30:16,096
was the filming of the finale of Mighty Ducks.

2203
01:30:16,576 --> 01:30:17,276
Wow. I didn't know.

2204
01:30:17,896 --> 01:30:21,636
Those kid actors, including Keenan Thompson, skated on the ice.

2205
01:30:21,736 --> 01:30:24,876
They were the first people ever to be in that venue.

2206
01:30:25,196 --> 01:30:27,936
The first event ever to happen was not a hockey game,

2207
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:30,436
but rather a Barry Manilow concert.

2208
01:30:30,856 --> 01:30:32,756
Barry Manilow opened the pond.

2209
01:30:33,096 --> 01:30:37,696
I'm looking here and Jim Belushi played Phil Palmfeather

2210
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:40,796
and Tim Curry played Lord Jorganis.

2211
01:30:41,596 --> 01:30:42,776
What was the what was the bad guy?

2212
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,636
It's incredible.

2213
01:30:43,876 --> 01:30:44,896
I know the list is crazy.

2214
01:30:44,936 --> 01:30:46,636
What was the bad guy you were saying before?

2215
01:30:46,856 --> 01:30:49,276
I was saying Mindbender, but I couldn't find any more info.

2216
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:50,776
I can't find anything about mind.

2217
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:51,976
I can find Hookerman.

2218
01:30:52,336 --> 01:30:55,496
I can find Dr. Wally Pretorius,

2219
01:30:56,036 --> 01:30:58,916
voiced by Matt Fruer, who was

2220
01:30:58,916 --> 01:31:03,476
the character on that generation X X-Men movie.

2221
01:31:03,516 --> 01:31:06,796
Oh, yeah. He was also one of these on other stuff.

2222
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:12,676
I think he's one of Zeus's henchmen in

2223
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,836
Hercules, which is which in these characters,

2224
01:31:15,956 --> 01:31:18,156
their names are like chaos or what are they called?

2225
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:20,016
They're in this they're in.

2226
01:31:20,276 --> 01:31:21,096
We we in panic.

2227
01:31:21,096 --> 01:31:24,116
We got to cut this out right now, because obviously this is an episode.

2228
01:31:24,116 --> 01:31:26,516
Full Mighty Ducks episode.

2229
01:31:26,656 --> 01:31:27,516
Look how much you're getting.

2230
01:31:28,176 --> 01:31:29,496
The Atlantic would never do this.

2231
01:31:29,736 --> 01:31:31,196
Fuck the Atlantic. Fuck Jeffrey Goldberg.

2232
01:31:32,016 --> 01:31:33,656
The Jewel Thief

2233
01:31:34,236 --> 01:31:35,756
character that I liked.

2234
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:38,496
His name was Duke Larrange.

2235
01:31:38,696 --> 01:31:41,416
All right. That's not we got.

2236
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:45,656
Let's watch the entire series and we'll come back to an episode.

2237
01:31:45,996 --> 01:31:49,276
So that's Mighty Ducks.

2238
01:31:49,596 --> 01:31:54,496
And I think what we have missed the most now is the Explorer Zone.

2239
01:31:54,696 --> 01:31:58,336
Yes. And that's the important part of my teased story.

2240
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,976
OK, the Explorer Zone,

2241
01:32:01,096 --> 01:32:04,136
because that has said we're virtual jungle cruise.

2242
01:32:04,136 --> 01:32:04,976
Yeah, of course.

2243
01:32:04,976 --> 01:32:06,156
It's Aladdin's magic carpet.

2244
01:32:06,436 --> 01:32:08,276
And we did.

2245
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:11,176
I remember doing Jungle Cruise and fine.

2246
01:32:11,436 --> 01:32:14,536
Oh, it's moving a little bit, but there you're such you're watching a TV.

2247
01:32:14,536 --> 01:32:16,036
It's not like you're that immersed.

2248
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:21,016
You're on a raft that is on like a big water bed and you're fake.

2249
01:32:21,016 --> 01:32:23,716
You're paddling. Yeah, paddling would be the word.

2250
01:32:23,776 --> 01:32:26,556
They had to know when they were developing this and they were like,

2251
01:32:26,556 --> 01:32:28,956
all right, we're putting this like they had to know this sucks, right?

2252
01:32:28,956 --> 01:32:31,136
It doesn't look it doesn't look good.

2253
01:32:31,136 --> 01:32:33,376
It's not even with the with the goggles.

2254
01:32:33,476 --> 01:32:35,136
You can say, well, now you look to the right and left.

2255
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:36,876
You see, you know, the jungle, you see difference.

2256
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:39,116
This is not that kid like you look to.

2257
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:41,356
There's like flats. There's nothing there.

2258
01:32:41,776 --> 01:32:45,176
But unlike the regular jungle cruise, it is dinosaurs.

2259
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:47,596
Yes, you go back in time, right?

2260
01:32:47,636 --> 01:32:48,636
That's the big thing at the start.

2261
01:32:48,636 --> 01:32:52,176
You go back in time or there's a guy who's like to go back.

2262
01:32:52,436 --> 01:32:57,196
I mean, you start the start screen is a weird magic kingdom world

2263
01:32:57,196 --> 01:33:01,916
with the has the Cinderella castle, the big castle, but also a Matterhorn,

2264
01:33:02,396 --> 01:33:05,356
which is not right. Disney Park has that.

2265
01:33:05,636 --> 01:33:06,316
So that's wrong.

2266
01:33:06,436 --> 01:33:09,396
Why is Disney not branding properly? Very strange.

2267
01:33:09,576 --> 01:33:12,316
The biggest error up until the point when Ryan Reynolds

2268
01:33:12,316 --> 01:33:14,676
tweeted that photo of Deadpool getting arrested.

2269
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:18,316
And you remember this and you you tweeted at him

2270
01:33:18,316 --> 01:33:19,756
that he had used the wrong picture.

2271
01:33:19,976 --> 01:33:23,936
I think he said, you know, for dead, I think it was.

2272
01:33:24,316 --> 01:33:25,916
Tweeted, he got arrested at Disney World

2273
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:27,616
and the Matterhorn was in the background and you were like,

2274
01:33:27,616 --> 01:33:28,856
this is not the right park.

2275
01:33:29,016 --> 01:33:31,136
Get with it, Deadpool. Yeah. Anyway.

2276
01:33:31,816 --> 01:33:33,436
Yeah. So that's inaccurate.

2277
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:37,776
Yeah. But I will say this plus up for the main jungle cruise,

2278
01:33:37,976 --> 01:33:39,236
adding dinosaurs, not the worst.

2279
01:33:39,236 --> 01:33:40,596
Oh, no, not at all.

2280
01:33:40,876 --> 01:33:43,296
Time travel component way into that. Cool.

2281
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:45,616
Hopefully that happens in that rock movie.

2282
01:33:45,736 --> 01:33:51,036
So yeah. But then you have Aladdin's carpet.

2283
01:33:51,276 --> 01:33:52,816
We have Aladdin's magic carpet ride.

2284
01:33:52,816 --> 01:33:57,456
And this was the ride, funny enough, that I was the most excited about.

2285
01:33:57,616 --> 01:34:00,916
Sure. Whenever whatever media stuff I looked at or whatever

2286
01:34:00,916 --> 01:34:04,936
article I was reading, this was touted as your ride in the carpet.

2287
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:08,036
Three, your virtual world looked to your left or right.

2288
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:09,876
You're in Agrabah. So excited.

2289
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:11,376
So we knew we had to do this.

2290
01:34:11,516 --> 01:34:13,916
So I don't remember how long the wait was, but I was this was

2291
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:15,576
this was the main event for me.

2292
01:34:15,636 --> 01:34:19,616
I got on it within 30 to 45 seconds.

2293
01:34:20,056 --> 01:34:21,996
I felt so ill.

2294
01:34:22,236 --> 01:34:24,916
I felt so dizzy and ill

2295
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:27,976
that I didn't even enjoy a sec.

2296
01:34:28,156 --> 01:34:29,216
Like I didn't.

2297
01:34:29,496 --> 01:34:31,456
30 seconds, probably now they think about it too long.

2298
01:34:31,536 --> 01:34:33,096
15 seconds. Yeah.

2299
01:34:33,496 --> 01:34:37,396
I felt so ill that I just wanted this thing off my head.

2300
01:34:37,396 --> 01:34:40,716
And I was fucked up like the rest of the day.

2301
01:34:40,736 --> 01:34:43,076
I never threw up, but I was woozy.

2302
01:34:43,576 --> 01:34:47,596
I felt weird. We had to leave Disney Quest. Oh.

2303
01:34:47,836 --> 01:34:50,036
It because I'm never like that on rides, right?

2304
01:34:50,316 --> 01:34:54,196
Even rides sometimes, even if like you eat and I go on a roller coaster,

2305
01:34:54,316 --> 01:34:55,496
I feel like, oh, I shouldn't have done that.

2306
01:34:55,516 --> 01:34:57,096
But it's not like a dire situation.

2307
01:34:57,256 --> 01:34:59,016
I was not good.

2308
01:34:59,296 --> 01:35:02,876
We left because I was just like when we had to get on a plane that day,

2309
01:35:03,356 --> 01:35:07,636
I just I think before that is when I bought Blood Sugar Sex Magic

2310
01:35:07,636 --> 01:35:09,136
from the Virgin Megastore.

2311
01:35:09,356 --> 01:35:11,136
So like, I don't think we went anywhere else.

2312
01:35:11,316 --> 01:35:12,216
Something to listen to.

2313
01:35:12,336 --> 01:35:13,616
Like that's a late buy.

2314
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:17,636
Very late buy. Yes, I was just getting into the red hot chili peppers

2315
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,376
at the time.

2316
01:35:20,656 --> 01:35:21,536
Uh huh. Yikes.

2317
01:35:21,896 --> 01:35:22,756
Hey, I don't know.

2318
01:35:22,756 --> 01:35:26,476
But that seems like that is a Aladdin problem, not a you problem.

2319
01:35:26,576 --> 01:35:27,716
No, I that's right.

2320
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:31,576
So so going through all this Disney Quest stuff, I just

2321
01:35:31,576 --> 01:35:35,496
first of all, have that feeling of like this thing letting me down so bad

2322
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:38,876
and then just fucking me up real bad on the way out.

2323
01:35:38,996 --> 01:35:42,556
And then I remember we got on the plane and I still felt weird on the plane.

2324
01:35:42,776 --> 01:35:45,076
And then there's a problem with the plane and they made us

2325
01:35:45,076 --> 01:35:46,776
de-bored, which is terrifying.

2326
01:35:47,156 --> 01:35:48,456
And then we had a voucher.

2327
01:35:48,456 --> 01:35:51,356
We got a voucher for like a sandwich and I ate a sandwich.

2328
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:54,156
And I fucking nice, man.

2329
01:35:54,576 --> 01:35:57,296
I remember I ate the sandwich and then I felt a little better

2330
01:35:57,296 --> 01:35:58,396
and the plane was OK.

2331
01:35:58,636 --> 01:35:59,776
The plane ride was OK.

2332
01:36:00,116 --> 01:36:03,816
But man, I have never been screwed up from a ride

2333
01:36:03,816 --> 01:36:07,596
more than I have at Disney Quest on this Aladdin ride.

2334
01:36:07,696 --> 01:36:09,856
Wow. So that is damning.

2335
01:36:09,876 --> 01:36:12,336
Colors my whole Disney Quest feeling.

2336
01:36:12,736 --> 01:36:13,816
Yeah, you did.

2337
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:15,396
And how long were you there before that?

2338
01:36:15,596 --> 01:36:17,536
I'm not sure. Probably a couple hours.

2339
01:36:17,716 --> 01:36:20,296
OK. Well, so you did get your your your ideal.

2340
01:36:20,296 --> 01:36:24,196
We got the two hours and we went through all the different zones

2341
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:26,316
and did in childhood nausea.

2342
01:36:26,436 --> 01:36:29,876
But yeah, childhood nausea never threw up, which was maybe even the problem.

2343
01:36:29,876 --> 01:36:33,616
Like I just never it was just like I think my head was screwed up.

2344
01:36:33,616 --> 01:36:36,096
Like I was woozy. Jason's laughing.

2345
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,916
I don't know why.

2346
01:36:37,276 --> 01:36:38,956
I was going to say so.

2347
01:36:39,036 --> 01:36:40,256
So you did eat the sandwich.

2348
01:36:40,276 --> 01:36:42,296
You didn't give it away. Give it away. Give it away.

2349
01:36:42,476 --> 01:36:42,976
Now.

2350
01:36:44,556 --> 01:36:49,376
I was going to say that all the dizziness made you feel like you lost some blood.

2351
01:36:49,376 --> 01:36:52,396
That's good. Yeah, we both had one.

2352
01:36:52,596 --> 01:36:56,656
I did a good check just to make sure like that that give it away was on

2353
01:36:56,656 --> 01:37:01,156
the album and I was like, it's like I felt like I won the lottery

2354
01:37:01,156 --> 01:37:03,076
when I was like it was got real.

2355
01:37:03,296 --> 01:37:09,876
Yes. Also, I guess also we could say that maybe my blood sugar sex magic was low.

2356
01:37:09,936 --> 01:37:11,656
Low. Yeah.

2357
01:37:12,036 --> 01:37:15,336
Got a ride called the treasure of the Incas.

2358
01:37:15,336 --> 01:37:20,196
Well, yes, that so that one didn't last very long

2359
01:37:20,196 --> 01:37:24,176
because it stopped working because of cell phone interference.

2360
01:37:24,176 --> 01:37:28,956
Yeah, the thing where you navigated little toy cars through ruins,

2361
01:37:28,956 --> 01:37:32,376
but they were controlled with radio waves and once they were in a cell

2362
01:37:32,376 --> 01:37:34,656
phones around and then one of them exploded.

2363
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:39,456
I heard once one lights on fire, which is the phone plan points out

2364
01:37:39,696 --> 01:37:43,176
a fire within a windowless

2365
01:37:43,176 --> 01:37:46,156
five story building, not an ideal situation.

2366
01:37:46,156 --> 01:37:47,936
I want to show this real quick back to the Aladdin.

2367
01:37:48,136 --> 01:37:50,996
Doesn't this look like something that you would when you go to a shoe store,

2368
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:52,636
they would try shoes on.

2369
01:37:53,396 --> 01:37:57,656
Well, you sit on you're straddling kind of a bench

2370
01:37:57,656 --> 01:38:00,036
that gives you like the motorcycle vibe, right?

2371
01:38:00,056 --> 01:38:01,016
Like you're in a saddle.

2372
01:38:01,156 --> 01:38:05,356
But yes, it's tan and it just looks like a like a shoe trying mechanism.

2373
01:38:05,356 --> 01:38:08,436
And there's a really funny part also of this Mandy Moore video where she

2374
01:38:08,436 --> 01:38:11,836
you follow her in and she goes and puts on the helmet,

2375
01:38:12,056 --> 01:38:16,296
but she's already wearing like a partial helmet that then somebody then

2376
01:38:16,296 --> 01:38:20,076
one of the helpers who are called navigators, by the way,

2377
01:38:20,256 --> 01:38:22,976
all of the really in Disney Quest are called navigators.

2378
01:38:22,976 --> 01:38:25,656
And they have a little stripe on their sleeve that says that.

2379
01:38:25,796 --> 01:38:29,556
And I found a Disney Quest Mickey Toy where he's in a Disney

2380
01:38:29,556 --> 01:38:33,416
Quest uniform with his name says Mickey and then on the sleeve navigator.

2381
01:38:33,536 --> 01:38:35,036
What kind of toy are we talking about?

2382
01:38:35,196 --> 01:38:37,096
Plush. Nice. Pretty good.

2383
01:38:37,096 --> 01:38:39,656
I found like a nice figure of it, but that's pretty good.

2384
01:38:40,036 --> 01:38:44,276
Now, this pin, a pin trading pin of Mickey in like kind of a

2385
01:38:44,276 --> 01:38:46,936
nondescript amorphous like tech suit.

2386
01:38:47,216 --> 01:38:50,076
I call this was another thing of kids cartoons, like characters

2387
01:38:50,076 --> 01:38:55,416
wearing armor where you're not quite sure what it does or what it's protecting them from.

2388
01:38:55,776 --> 01:38:57,896
So then so the navigators, though, would be like either

2389
01:38:57,896 --> 01:38:59,456
navigating you on your quest.

2390
01:39:00,196 --> 01:39:01,576
Is that the idea? Disney Quest.

2391
01:39:01,576 --> 01:39:05,436
You control your own quest, but the navigators help in case

2392
01:39:05,436 --> 01:39:06,456
you don't know where to go.

2393
01:39:06,456 --> 01:39:09,996
OK, I don't know if I go is Aladdin's

2394
01:39:09,996 --> 01:39:16,716
magic carpet ride on the third level of the explore zone

2395
01:39:16,716 --> 01:39:19,376
or is it on the fifth level of score zone?

2396
01:39:19,556 --> 01:39:22,076
The navigators know.

2397
01:39:22,176 --> 01:39:24,036
Oh, this is a mess.

2398
01:39:24,476 --> 01:39:27,516
So as all right. So Jungle Cruise with dinosaurs.

2399
01:39:27,736 --> 01:39:29,976
Mike gets nausea.

2400
01:39:29,976 --> 01:39:31,496
Yeah, the Incas explodes.

2401
01:39:31,896 --> 01:39:34,156
Then you've got a Hercules in the underworld.

2402
01:39:34,156 --> 01:39:35,496
Hercules in the underworld

2403
01:39:35,496 --> 01:39:42,276
starring the Hades played by everyone's favorite star.

2404
01:39:42,516 --> 01:39:43,736
It's still for this day.

2405
01:39:43,736 --> 01:39:45,236
James Woods.

2406
01:39:47,016 --> 01:39:48,476
Yeah, if only if Disney

2407
01:39:48,476 --> 01:39:51,596
Quest had the technology to keep him from being locked out of his own Twitter.

2408
01:39:52,256 --> 01:39:53,296
That's something that happened.

2409
01:39:53,996 --> 01:39:54,696
I don't know.

2410
01:39:55,516 --> 01:39:57,256
Twitter problems sucks.

2411
01:39:57,756 --> 01:39:59,056
Pain and panic are there.

2412
01:39:59,096 --> 01:40:02,536
I think one of one of whom is the person you mentioned, Bobcat Goldthwait, one of them.

2413
01:40:02,536 --> 01:40:04,716
I don't know if they did voices for this.

2414
01:40:05,336 --> 01:40:08,576
Oh, should mention, by the way, the Aladdin thing does have this appearance

2415
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,536
by John Ennis for Mr.

2416
01:40:10,756 --> 01:40:11,696
Show, which we talked about.

2417
01:40:12,156 --> 01:40:14,016
Yeah, say any lines, apparently.

2418
01:40:14,036 --> 01:40:15,856
He's in kind of like a Hawaiian shirt.

2419
01:40:15,856 --> 01:40:17,176
He's a vacationer.

2420
01:40:17,316 --> 01:40:20,956
He is like Ken Marino in Rock and Rollercoaster.

2421
01:40:21,056 --> 01:40:24,916
And I found an article pointing out the this blight of

2422
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:29,136
talented skits, comedians given no lines in 90s Disney attractions.

2423
01:40:29,376 --> 01:40:31,376
1998 Disney attractions, in fact.

2424
01:40:31,596 --> 01:40:32,376
Oh, strange.

2425
01:40:32,816 --> 01:40:33,376
That's weird.

2426
01:40:33,756 --> 01:40:36,516
What do you anything to say about Hercules in the underworld?

2427
01:40:36,756 --> 01:40:39,076
I think you collect lightning bolts.

2428
01:40:39,076 --> 01:40:44,316
Oh, yes. And I heard the the Manny Moore dad says, give me the lightning bolts.

2429
01:40:44,356 --> 01:40:49,096
And then I think Hades also yells, give me back the lightning bolts.

2430
01:40:49,116 --> 01:40:50,296
So maybe that was what I read.

2431
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:52,176
That might have been his line. Yes.

2432
01:40:52,196 --> 01:40:56,256
Oh, no, I'm sorry. The dad says, oh, yeah, they're walking

2433
01:40:56,256 --> 01:40:58,236
under the sign that has Hercules on it.

2434
01:40:58,236 --> 01:41:01,256
And then the dad says, oh, there he is.

2435
01:41:02,996 --> 01:41:03,876
My favorite guy.

2436
01:41:03,876 --> 01:41:05,856
Like he just saw his college roommate.

2437
01:41:06,096 --> 01:41:06,996
Like he just saw his buddy.

2438
01:41:07,136 --> 01:41:08,836
Hey, there you are, Hercules.

2439
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,236
You old son of a bitch.

2440
01:41:11,636 --> 01:41:14,776
This one might have like the best graphics

2441
01:41:14,776 --> 01:41:17,536
of like the ones that use any character.

2442
01:41:17,756 --> 01:41:18,376
And I don't know.

2443
01:41:18,596 --> 01:41:19,796
I mean, the bar is low.

2444
01:41:19,816 --> 01:41:21,456
You might be right, but that might be right.

2445
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:25,916
Yeah, that's why I'm trying to be like, this one also was fulfilled

2446
01:41:25,916 --> 01:41:29,216
its destiny and was eventually replaced. Right.

2447
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,556
The only thing ever added to the Disney quests

2448
01:41:32,556 --> 01:41:37,036
was an attraction called Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for Buccaneer

2449
01:41:37,036 --> 01:41:41,996
Gold, notable for being before the films and the first other thing

2450
01:41:41,996 --> 01:41:44,196
besides the ride about Pirates of the Caribbean.

2451
01:41:44,616 --> 01:41:47,556
And people kind of liked this one and attribute

2452
01:41:47,556 --> 01:41:53,676
the technology that today powers Midway Mania is having a precedent in this ride.

2453
01:41:54,236 --> 01:41:59,116
This ride made me laugh because the the the skeleton,

2454
01:41:59,116 --> 01:42:01,256
there's a pirate skeleton who talks to you.

2455
01:42:01,476 --> 01:42:06,676
He trains you and he turns out to be the boss at the end.

2456
01:42:06,976 --> 01:42:10,416
And he also looks like the admin,

2457
01:42:10,556 --> 01:42:14,456
the skeleton in charge of at the share zone.

2458
01:42:14,856 --> 01:42:18,376
The funny Twitter account with skeleton.

2459
01:42:18,476 --> 01:42:24,116
It's like the like memes that look like very intense, like, you know,

2460
01:42:24,316 --> 01:42:26,696
the the Carpe the fuck out of the DM,

2461
01:42:27,336 --> 01:42:29,496
like kind of like 3D skeleton.

2462
01:42:29,496 --> 01:42:31,576
But is this like a youth thing?

2463
01:42:32,056 --> 01:42:32,736
Is this one of your?

2464
01:42:32,976 --> 01:42:34,296
No, no, I think this is an older.

2465
01:42:34,556 --> 01:42:35,876
This is more like a drill.

2466
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:37,136
So it's weird for later.

2467
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:41,156
I think it's been around that long, but it's but all the so all of them.

2468
01:42:41,156 --> 01:42:45,516
But instead of saying like, you know, guns and beer, all the memes say like,

2469
01:42:45,776 --> 01:42:50,496
I'm sorry, I fucked up again or like depression, anxiety.

2470
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:53,736
But it's like a real intense skeleton riding a motorcycle.

2471
01:42:53,936 --> 01:42:55,196
This is very complicated.

2472
01:42:55,196 --> 01:42:57,476
And you have to look into this.

2473
01:42:58,536 --> 01:42:59,476
So it looks like all right.

2474
01:42:59,536 --> 01:43:00,836
So it's graphics. It looked like a meme.

2475
01:43:00,956 --> 01:43:01,696
It's a skeleton man.

2476
01:43:01,796 --> 01:43:03,976
People did kind of like this, but still not very good.

2477
01:43:04,456 --> 01:43:06,076
And this all of the attractions.

2478
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:07,996
I have we made it through the zones.

2479
01:43:08,136 --> 01:43:08,976
I think so.

2480
01:43:09,356 --> 01:43:12,176
Do we get the snow? Do we get all the zone stone in the zone stone?

2481
01:43:12,476 --> 01:43:16,716
I think a thing that stuck out to me about the Pirates of the Caribbean ride

2482
01:43:16,716 --> 01:43:20,916
was that it was hard to do, and sometimes you could lose it.

2483
01:43:20,916 --> 01:43:23,076
Like you could not accomplish your task.

2484
01:43:23,116 --> 01:43:23,896
Good. I like that.

2485
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:25,216
But that has to make people upset.

2486
01:43:25,236 --> 01:43:25,856
That's the problem.

2487
01:43:25,936 --> 01:43:28,376
Supposedly, they're running into with the Millennium Falcon ride

2488
01:43:28,376 --> 01:43:29,536
that will be coming next year.

2489
01:43:29,616 --> 01:43:31,176
Oh, yeah. Now, that's one thing.

2490
01:43:31,196 --> 01:43:34,556
This is all the beginnings of this is the first

2491
01:43:34,556 --> 01:43:38,396
that I think I consider maybe Disney Quest was all experimenting

2492
01:43:38,396 --> 01:43:43,236
in a way of to get kinds of rides that are more interactive into the parks.

2493
01:43:43,336 --> 01:43:45,176
I think Disney was starting to freak out in the 90s.

2494
01:43:45,176 --> 01:43:48,476
People have experiences at home that they can control.

2495
01:43:48,496 --> 01:43:52,256
And we need to start doing things like that, which they did far more successfully

2496
01:43:52,256 --> 01:43:55,256
with Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster's plural.

2497
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:57,996
And obviously Midway Mania.

2498
01:43:58,036 --> 01:43:59,276
And now the Falcon is coming.

2499
01:44:00,376 --> 01:44:02,856
But all of these things or I don't know.

2500
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:05,416
I don't mind a not interactive experience.

2501
01:44:05,896 --> 01:44:07,916
I know. Sometimes it's better. Yeah.

2502
01:44:07,976 --> 01:44:11,696
But I it's funny to me that this closes in 97.

2503
01:44:11,956 --> 01:44:13,696
Excuse me. 2017.

2504
01:44:14,496 --> 01:44:15,856
Jesus. 2017.

2505
01:44:16,196 --> 01:44:21,356
Right as legit satisfying VR experiences are showing up everywhere.

2506
01:44:21,816 --> 01:44:23,936
Yeah, it's like that whole time.

2507
01:44:23,936 --> 01:44:28,196
The void is coming out months or is already out probably when this closes,

2508
01:44:28,716 --> 01:44:30,376
whatever the first version of it was.

2509
01:44:30,776 --> 01:44:34,556
Money and Falcon Ride is going to be awesome, probably very satisfying.

2510
01:44:34,756 --> 01:44:38,956
So they close it right when the technology has finally gotten to the point

2511
01:44:38,956 --> 01:44:40,256
where people like this stuff.

2512
01:44:40,856 --> 01:44:41,516
That's true.

2513
01:44:41,636 --> 01:44:44,336
And if they had just gone in and replaced all of it.

2514
01:44:44,556 --> 01:44:47,756
Right. It feels like they could have taken even maybe some of the same ideas

2515
01:44:47,756 --> 01:44:49,836
and done the same thing.

2516
01:44:49,836 --> 01:44:53,196
Like I don't it's just weird because when Lindsay and I were in Japan,

2517
01:44:53,196 --> 01:44:55,916
we went to a VR zone and it was certainly not themed at all.

2518
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:57,356
It was very kind of utilitarian.

2519
01:44:57,756 --> 01:45:00,276
You go up to nothing that was that themed.

2520
01:45:00,356 --> 01:45:03,416
But they had like 12 different experiences and you'd go over to the

2521
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:04,536
especially the Mario Kart one.

2522
01:45:04,556 --> 01:45:06,736
But you go to the Mario Kart one and there's a little like cart,

2523
01:45:06,736 --> 01:45:10,696
a design like cart you would sit in and it's not like nothing fancy around it.

2524
01:45:10,696 --> 01:45:13,336
But the VR itself is awesome.

2525
01:45:14,256 --> 01:45:18,056
So like there exists now to have all this really cool VR stuff

2526
01:45:18,056 --> 01:45:22,136
and they close it right like literally within the year,

2527
01:45:22,156 --> 01:45:26,396
probably when this stuff starts coming into its own, like with home VR use

2528
01:45:26,396 --> 01:45:31,636
is all like 2016, 2017 with Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR.

2529
01:45:31,776 --> 01:45:35,496
In the same way that they close Stitch's Great Escape right before they announce

2530
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:40,276
a Stitch live action film, they close Country Bears right before

2531
01:45:40,276 --> 01:45:42,416
the Country Bears movie is released.

2532
01:45:42,956 --> 01:45:45,696
Some of this timing is very, some of their timing is very bad.

2533
01:45:45,696 --> 01:45:48,796
And let's not forget that we're going.

2534
01:45:49,076 --> 01:45:52,076
Oh, no, I was going to say talking about crazy timing.

2535
01:45:52,516 --> 01:45:55,776
The Chicago one closed September 4th, 2001.

2536
01:45:55,776 --> 01:45:59,096
The very month that the first Strokes record.

2537
01:45:59,656 --> 01:46:04,176
No, never forget.

2538
01:46:04,336 --> 01:46:07,216
No wonder September 2001 looms so large.

2539
01:46:07,476 --> 01:46:08,576
And I knew it was something.

2540
01:46:08,856 --> 01:46:10,156
This is it. Never forget.

2541
01:46:10,476 --> 01:46:12,816
So all right. Here's.

2542
01:46:13,136 --> 01:46:17,116
So this enterprise is in theory thriving.

2543
01:46:17,436 --> 01:46:21,256
The Disney World one opens and probably does fine for a little bit.

2544
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:24,216
Enough to not change the plans of opening Chicago.

2545
01:46:24,556 --> 01:46:28,036
They opened Chicago in a lavish ceremony.

2546
01:46:28,276 --> 01:46:31,336
And oh, yeah, the stars, including Melissa Joan Hart,

2547
01:46:31,796 --> 01:46:34,196
Joan Cusack and no other stars.

2548
01:46:34,556 --> 01:46:36,756
I'm sorry, John. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2549
01:46:36,976 --> 01:46:41,036
And Amir and Chicago's favorite mayor, Richard Daly was there.

2550
01:46:41,036 --> 01:46:41,876
Oh, is that right?

2551
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:42,796
That's interesting.

2552
01:46:42,856 --> 01:46:44,616
The only way it happened.

2553
01:46:45,276 --> 01:46:46,136
Daily gave it the OK.

2554
01:46:46,396 --> 01:46:48,836
Richard Daly, somehow a better mayor than Rahm Emanuel.

2555
01:46:49,256 --> 01:46:51,916
Incredible. So much better somehow.

2556
01:46:52,276 --> 01:46:55,996
Anyway, so crazed by the opening ceremony.

2557
01:46:56,256 --> 01:46:58,796
I love it, by the way, you get to see everybody in Chicago.

2558
01:46:59,216 --> 01:47:02,896
Got to see Buzz Lightyear flying around on a jetpack to the fan.

2559
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:04,736
Yes, yes, that's fantastic.

2560
01:47:04,976 --> 01:47:08,116
I wrote that down. Yeah, that's that's very cool.

2561
01:47:08,396 --> 01:47:10,576
So we're we're hopping now.

2562
01:47:10,576 --> 01:47:12,216
We got two Disney quests.

2563
01:47:12,336 --> 01:47:13,576
We're building the third.

2564
01:47:13,936 --> 01:47:16,916
And then it just all falls apart.

2565
01:47:17,636 --> 01:47:21,816
And and it's you know, I think they could have started to change them out.

2566
01:47:22,796 --> 01:47:26,396
And like all of the all of the locations, one that was doing less well

2567
01:47:26,396 --> 01:47:28,516
could have sustained others that were I'm sorry,

2568
01:47:28,796 --> 01:47:31,356
one Disney quest are doing better, could have sustained ones

2569
01:47:31,356 --> 01:47:34,056
that weren't doing as much business, but they only got to the two.

2570
01:47:34,436 --> 01:47:35,876
And the Chicago one was tanking.

2571
01:47:35,976 --> 01:47:39,856
And I think all of the rest of Disney regional entertainment club, Disney,

2572
01:47:39,876 --> 01:47:43,916
this like kids, this little kids experience did really badly.

2573
01:47:44,116 --> 01:47:45,376
ESPN never did great.

2574
01:47:45,636 --> 01:47:47,156
It just all kind of collapsed.

2575
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:48,296
This whole thing.

2576
01:47:48,516 --> 01:47:50,116
Yeah. Philadelphia never opened.

2577
01:47:50,416 --> 01:47:51,676
There was going to be a Toronto.

2578
01:47:51,856 --> 01:47:54,956
They even picked a location, which today is kind of a little fake

2579
01:47:54,956 --> 01:47:56,916
Times Square in Toronto.

2580
01:47:57,016 --> 01:47:58,776
It's just that's like movie theaters and stuff.

2581
01:47:58,776 --> 01:48:01,196
Now there was going to be one in Anaheim, potentially.

2582
01:48:01,196 --> 01:48:04,216
I couldn't find where they intended to put that,

2583
01:48:04,416 --> 01:48:06,936
but probably somewhere in downtown Disney.

2584
01:48:07,256 --> 01:48:12,276
They were going to, you know, demolish the pirates and put it there.

2585
01:48:13,356 --> 01:48:15,996
So it all just started to collapse.

2586
01:48:16,396 --> 01:48:20,076
Chicago closes in 2001, canceled Philadelphia.

2587
01:48:20,896 --> 01:48:24,756
And then so presumably the closure of Disney World would be to follow.

2588
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:28,176
But it doesn't. It stays open, but never updates.

2589
01:48:28,376 --> 01:48:31,176
They just lose elements piece by piece.

2590
01:48:31,516 --> 01:48:33,336
The price gets kind of cheaper and cheaper.

2591
01:48:33,456 --> 01:48:35,576
There's more like weird deals to get in there,

2592
01:48:35,576 --> 01:48:37,796
but there's less and less to do there.

2593
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:42,016
It just becomes like, I don't know, here's a bunch of arcade games or it.

2594
01:48:42,116 --> 01:48:45,836
It all like it just was they put like their decay.

2595
01:48:45,856 --> 01:48:47,776
Yeah, strangely for so long.

2596
01:48:47,816 --> 01:48:50,516
I don't think I realized when we went in 20.

2597
01:48:50,516 --> 01:48:51,836
What do we go for 2014?

2598
01:48:51,996 --> 01:48:55,196
I think I don't think I realized it was there like you still.

2599
01:48:55,196 --> 01:48:57,516
I didn't think I was like, oh, my God, why?

2600
01:48:57,776 --> 01:49:00,116
It felt like it was gone for 10 years before that.

2601
01:49:00,196 --> 01:49:01,536
There there is an article.

2602
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:05,556
There's a Chicago Tribune article that is so it's so crazy.

2603
01:49:05,556 --> 01:49:09,336
To me, because it's before or right around when it was opening.

2604
01:49:09,436 --> 01:49:13,736
And I've never seen a news article be like an like an omen.

2605
01:49:13,956 --> 01:49:18,096
Like it's right. Yeah, it's not going to work like all.

2606
01:49:18,256 --> 01:49:21,496
Here's the quote from Art Levitt himself.

2607
01:49:21,996 --> 01:49:26,336
By the nature of it, location based entertainment is difficult to succeed in.

2608
01:49:27,016 --> 01:49:30,336
We've got to learn the hard way and see what we do.

2609
01:49:31,376 --> 01:49:35,896
Like they already knew like this is going to be hard to accomplish.

2610
01:49:35,896 --> 01:49:38,756
And there's stuff in the dimension, the defunct land.

2611
01:49:38,996 --> 01:49:43,616
But it's in a bunch of articles to that, like for it to have been profitable,

2612
01:49:43,676 --> 01:49:48,856
that would have had to run full capacity 17 hours a day or so.

2613
01:49:49,216 --> 01:49:51,116
And yeah, that's never going to.

2614
01:49:51,196 --> 01:49:54,616
And if they're your ideal amount of time is two hours.

2615
01:49:54,696 --> 01:49:56,876
The numbers never made sense on this.

2616
01:49:57,116 --> 01:49:58,716
And also just the base.

2617
01:49:58,876 --> 01:50:04,496
How did they not realize people don't want to go to downtown Chicago,

2618
01:50:04,796 --> 01:50:11,276
go to a windowless building and play already out of the arc?

2619
01:50:11,296 --> 01:50:13,136
Things that suck. Yeah. Yeah.

2620
01:50:13,396 --> 01:50:14,676
Like, I don't understand how.

2621
01:50:14,676 --> 01:50:17,636
Yeah, even I understand that you invested a bunch of money.

2622
01:50:17,636 --> 01:50:20,796
And the certain points are like, well, just open in Orlando.

2623
01:50:20,896 --> 01:50:23,036
And let's see if we can get them make the money back that we spend.

2624
01:50:23,436 --> 01:50:25,676
But it does seem like you're going to lose more money

2625
01:50:25,676 --> 01:50:29,856
opening a full another one in Chicago, which is a weird market to do it.

2626
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:32,856
You have like most of these people had to know this stuff sucked.

2627
01:50:32,856 --> 01:50:37,416
The novelty of like they had to be like, we have Disney World.

2628
01:50:37,716 --> 01:50:41,096
We know what an experience is that satisfying feels like.

2629
01:50:41,296 --> 01:50:43,676
But what almost none of this feels like that.

2630
01:50:43,756 --> 01:50:47,036
What if I were to tell you about one very special night

2631
01:50:47,036 --> 01:50:51,956
where all the stars in the 1990 sky got to experience Disney Quest?

2632
01:50:52,156 --> 01:50:54,016
Not in Chicago. No, in Orlando.

2633
01:50:54,016 --> 01:50:56,216
You say to what you refer, Jason.

2634
01:50:56,456 --> 01:50:59,596
Oh, why? There's an Orlando Sentinel article

2635
01:50:59,596 --> 01:51:03,836
about how one night Ian's earring

2636
01:51:03,836 --> 01:51:06,756
I am hearing I am hearing the voice of the.

2637
01:51:06,816 --> 01:51:08,576
He's in the Mighty Ducks.

2638
01:51:08,656 --> 01:51:10,216
The main one wild wing.

2639
01:51:10,276 --> 01:51:15,956
Uh, Lacey Shebert, Shebert, Shebert, Party by Me girls.

2640
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:17,996
Jody Lynn O'Caffey.

2641
01:51:18,136 --> 01:51:19,256
I forget what show she was.

2642
01:51:19,396 --> 01:51:20,076
Star is coming.

2643
01:51:20,336 --> 01:51:22,216
Keep the stars coming in sync.

2644
01:51:22,216 --> 01:51:22,976
Uh huh.

2645
01:51:23,016 --> 01:51:24,376
Well, they're a manager.

2646
01:51:25,016 --> 01:51:26,076
Nicky Lipnicki.

2647
01:51:26,076 --> 01:51:28,136
What about Nsync's manager?

2648
01:51:28,356 --> 01:51:30,216
I don't know if he was there.

2649
01:51:30,216 --> 01:51:33,236
He shouldn't be allowed in Disney Quest without a child.

2650
01:51:33,416 --> 01:51:33,916
To see it.

2651
01:51:34,076 --> 01:51:36,396
And they also all enjoyed it.

2652
01:51:36,436 --> 01:51:38,256
If you can believe that I can.

2653
01:51:38,756 --> 01:51:41,636
The first place I saw the celebrities taking part

2654
01:51:41,636 --> 01:51:45,516
in the Disney Quest activity was at the Mighty Ducks pinball slam game.

2655
01:51:45,736 --> 01:51:49,776
I got a good glimpse of Justin, Joey, Lance, J.C.

2656
01:51:49,776 --> 01:51:51,756
and Chris of Nsync, Jonathan,

2657
01:51:51,756 --> 01:51:57,456
like Mickey from Jerry Maguire and Ziering as they played a life size pinball game.

2658
01:51:57,816 --> 01:51:58,736
Lipnicki what?

2659
01:52:00,016 --> 01:52:01,276
That's for the reporter.

2660
01:52:02,096 --> 01:52:02,956
You mean Justin?

2661
01:52:03,536 --> 01:52:05,956
Yeah, they all they're all professional dancers.

2662
01:52:06,036 --> 01:52:07,956
They should know how to pivot better than anybody.

2663
01:52:08,196 --> 01:52:08,456
Yeah.

2664
01:52:08,836 --> 01:52:09,316
Wow.

2665
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:12,996
Well, I guess that proves that Nsync sucks.

2666
01:52:12,996 --> 01:52:14,756
They're idiots.

2667
01:52:14,756 --> 01:52:15,996
Lipnicki rules.

2668
01:52:16,096 --> 01:52:22,736
But I guess it also shows that for one magical night in 1998 or so,

2669
01:52:23,376 --> 01:52:24,956
everything at Disney Quest was perfect.

2670
01:52:25,196 --> 01:52:29,436
And that's really what you were able to do until 2017 is go experience

2671
01:52:29,436 --> 01:52:32,016
the vibe of a perfect 1998 night.

2672
01:52:32,176 --> 01:52:38,796
I found a review of this place from 11 years ago on WDW Magic.

2673
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:43,616
And it sounds like it was written by a person in the company for PR purposes.

2674
01:52:44,116 --> 01:52:46,236
But it supposedly was from a fan.

2675
01:52:46,956 --> 01:52:50,456
And there must be people that did have a good time is what I'm

2676
01:52:50,456 --> 01:52:51,496
is where I'm getting at with this.

2677
01:52:52,016 --> 01:52:54,036
This headline of this review is OMG.

2678
01:52:54,376 --> 01:52:58,336
I loved this written by a person named Mouse Worshipper.

2679
01:52:59,576 --> 01:53:00,776
Although I guess that's suspicious.

2680
01:53:01,436 --> 01:53:04,016
Me and my bro were teens, adored this.

2681
01:53:05,076 --> 01:53:10,556
The flashing lights, noisy games, being a teen and virtual technology rock hard.

2682
01:53:11,536 --> 01:53:15,336
But when I took my mom and 20 something aunt at their own request,

2683
01:53:15,496 --> 01:53:18,316
despite all my warnings, they freaked out with overstimulation.

2684
01:53:18,576 --> 01:53:20,456
Both of them were totally exhausted by the end.

2685
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:23,856
But for teens, trustworthy enough to be released from parental supervision,

2686
01:53:24,296 --> 01:53:27,616
even if the adults are just somewhere else in downtown Disney, it's not to be missed.

2687
01:53:28,036 --> 01:53:30,636
Contrary to popular belief, almost everything comes with cost of

2688
01:53:30,636 --> 01:53:33,656
admission aside from food, go Cheesecake Factory Express.

2689
01:53:34,896 --> 01:53:37,876
That does sound fake, but like, what would be the point of a fake

2690
01:53:37,876 --> 01:53:43,796
like a bot, a Russian bot posting on WDW Magic 11 years ago under the name Mouse Worshipper?

2691
01:53:43,976 --> 01:53:45,076
I had so much fun.

2692
01:53:45,116 --> 01:53:48,396
It really distracted me from the pressure of my balls dropping.

2693
01:53:49,136 --> 01:53:52,716
Anyway, signed off me a real teen.

2694
01:53:52,996 --> 01:53:54,956
Me and my sister, ages 12 to 15.

2695
01:53:55,716 --> 01:54:02,376
I found a video on YouTube from like 2012 where a kid is very sarcastically reading

2696
01:54:03,876 --> 01:54:09,296
the synopsis of the Ride the Comics, like outside of the building, like by the box office.

2697
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:13,976
And then he turns the camera around and goes, sounds great for 1994.

2698
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,596
And that's great.

2699
01:54:16,736 --> 01:54:18,896
Slam. It's very caustic to watch.

2700
01:54:19,256 --> 01:54:20,636
It's very unpleasant to watch.

2701
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:24,536
Me after this, I have yet to debut that footage that exists of me

2702
01:54:24,536 --> 01:54:27,936
goofing on University of Energy after I went on it when I was like 10.

2703
01:54:28,176 --> 01:54:30,236
Oh, yeah. Is that a Patreon exclusive?

2704
01:54:30,236 --> 01:54:32,196
That's a Patreon exclusive, I think.

2705
01:54:32,456 --> 01:54:34,516
Mike own University of Energy.

2706
01:54:34,796 --> 01:54:38,136
While Death Comedy Jam music plays in the background.

2707
01:54:39,576 --> 01:54:40,636
Oh, shit.

2708
01:54:41,876 --> 01:54:45,316
So that's the tale of Disney Quest.

2709
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:46,376
Yeah, I know.

2710
01:54:46,436 --> 01:54:49,036
Look, we've been talking for a while and I don't I don't think I

2711
01:54:49,036 --> 01:54:54,856
I don't feel like we should do a full like plus it up, but I do have a very quick plus it up idea,

2712
01:54:54,996 --> 01:54:56,676
which is Windows.

2713
01:54:57,636 --> 01:55:04,696
I truly think the entire business changes with two windows in Chicago.

2714
01:55:04,696 --> 01:55:09,476
You can look out a window on the fifth floor and probably see a cool view of something in Chicago.

2715
01:55:09,876 --> 01:55:11,536
What are we do? Why would this?

2716
01:55:11,656 --> 01:55:14,776
I think that's all it would take a little bit of natural light.

2717
01:55:15,036 --> 01:55:16,636
There's nothing central to the premise.

2718
01:55:17,036 --> 01:55:22,496
The windows would have disrupted my plus it up is keep it open for another year.

2719
01:55:22,936 --> 01:55:27,976
Redo it to make it look nicer and then put all the stuff you're making for other things into it.

2720
01:55:28,276 --> 01:55:30,196
Put the Millennium Falcon right into it.

2721
01:55:30,216 --> 01:55:33,316
Put the Wreck-It Ralph ride that's coming to Florida into it.

2722
01:55:33,316 --> 01:55:36,376
Put two levels of different void experiences into it.

2723
01:55:36,796 --> 01:55:40,456
Great. People will be like, oh, wow, that all the stuff is very cool.

2724
01:55:40,556 --> 01:55:41,676
We really like that.

2725
01:55:41,896 --> 01:55:45,916
Do you think that somebody like hit a demolition button

2726
01:55:45,916 --> 01:55:50,416
like and boom, it imploded and then like checked their phone

2727
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:53,496
and saw a headline that says VR all the rage.

2728
01:55:53,756 --> 01:55:55,596
No, god damn it.

2729
01:55:55,736 --> 01:55:57,776
It's too late. Yes, that's what I think happened.

2730
01:55:58,056 --> 01:56:02,556
Jason, bring it back just as is.

2731
01:56:03,176 --> 01:56:07,176
But put an Atlantis game in it where you get to play as Milo.

2732
01:56:07,396 --> 01:56:10,356
He said that looking to the ceiling longingly.

2733
01:56:10,636 --> 01:56:14,356
I'm surprised you didn't say bring it back, but get rid of everything

2734
01:56:14,356 --> 01:56:16,516
except for the Cheesecake Factory Express.

2735
01:56:16,516 --> 01:56:18,216
I mean, it's crazy.

2736
01:56:18,316 --> 01:56:21,476
There has not been a cheesecake factory at any of the downtown Disney.

2737
01:56:21,716 --> 01:56:25,256
That is an odd oversight, I believe, as a cheese.

2738
01:56:25,736 --> 01:56:27,196
Oh, really? Smart. Oh, smart.

2739
01:56:27,496 --> 01:56:30,816
Yes. That's why the Chinese will eventually rule us.

2740
01:56:31,056 --> 01:56:35,896
Yeah. And for and and for the donors who give us

2741
01:56:35,896 --> 01:56:39,536
three thousand dollars a month, we will have dinner with you

2742
01:56:39,536 --> 01:56:42,036
at the Shanghai Disneyland Cheesecake Factory.

2743
01:56:42,036 --> 01:56:44,236
Pay for us to fly out, though. Yeah.

2744
01:56:44,916 --> 01:56:48,616
We're asking a lot here, but you're getting a lot.

2745
01:56:48,916 --> 01:56:52,836
You're getting a meal encounter that will take less time

2746
01:56:52,836 --> 01:56:54,636
than the podcast you just listened to.

2747
01:56:56,296 --> 01:57:00,336
So anyways, that you've with that,

2748
01:57:00,436 --> 01:57:03,876
you survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

2749
01:57:05,116 --> 01:57:06,976
Should there be some way to sequelify it?

2750
01:57:07,156 --> 01:57:10,296
Like it's too you too vived.

2751
01:57:10,816 --> 01:57:12,556
I'll figure out how to make it.

2752
01:57:12,736 --> 01:57:15,096
Well, for this specific one, I do want to survive.

2753
01:57:15,096 --> 01:57:18,516
I could throw that through the vocoder like it's if it was a cyber

2754
01:57:18,516 --> 01:57:20,976
sign off or something, but that would be specific to this.

2755
01:57:21,156 --> 01:57:21,696
Yeah. All right.

2756
01:57:21,696 --> 01:57:23,936
Let's get the whiteboard out, put a pot of coffee on.

2757
01:57:24,056 --> 01:57:25,076
We got to figure this out.

2758
01:57:25,076 --> 01:57:27,516
We got to figure out how to change the catchphrase.

2759
01:57:27,516 --> 01:57:32,716
But for now, we will take the cyber later back down to the bottom floor

2760
01:57:32,716 --> 01:57:33,536
and let you out.

2761
01:57:33,636 --> 01:57:37,176
But seriously, thank you for listening to the first episode of this thing.

2762
01:57:37,236 --> 01:57:39,576
I want to say the people who have

2763
01:57:39,576 --> 01:57:42,136
presumably followed us here, unless no one did.

2764
01:57:42,216 --> 01:57:43,716
It's possible you're talking to no one.

2765
01:57:43,896 --> 01:57:44,576
Yes, could be.

2766
01:57:44,696 --> 01:57:46,836
But that's the risk you run with any podcast.

2767
01:57:47,976 --> 01:57:50,836
But the people who have like been into this support of this,

2768
01:57:50,916 --> 01:57:52,376
you've wanted this kind of thing.

2769
01:57:52,516 --> 01:57:54,556
I've just been especially through the city walk saga.

2770
01:57:54,616 --> 01:57:56,196
People were so nice.

2771
01:57:56,536 --> 01:57:57,736
Yes. All of that.

2772
01:57:57,956 --> 01:57:59,196
And this podcast in general.

2773
01:57:59,336 --> 01:58:02,996
And thanks for wanting more and encouraging us to do more.

2774
01:58:03,456 --> 01:58:04,136
Y'all are great.

2775
01:58:04,196 --> 01:58:05,776
We're going to give you some fun stuff here.

2776
01:58:05,816 --> 01:58:09,636
Yeah. And we're we're sometimes we're a little cynical, you know,

2777
01:58:09,636 --> 01:58:11,496
but we would like to say thank you.

2778
01:58:11,496 --> 01:58:14,396
That's like the best I can do because people think I'm always joking

2779
01:58:14,396 --> 01:58:17,276
when I'm saying something sincerely, but I am saying thank you for doing this.

2780
01:58:17,736 --> 01:58:20,236
Yeah. You said something right before recording.

2781
01:58:20,236 --> 01:58:21,276
And I meant it sincerely.

2782
01:58:21,516 --> 01:58:22,516
It's not like I was trying to own.

2783
01:58:22,796 --> 01:58:24,876
We'll do that. So weird.

2784
01:58:25,376 --> 01:58:27,876
Yeah. It was like a problem.

2785
01:58:28,236 --> 01:58:30,816
And you would just usually toss it off.

2786
01:58:30,856 --> 01:58:32,076
But it came out so weird.

2787
01:58:32,196 --> 01:58:34,376
Even I was like, what the fuck was that?

2788
01:58:34,376 --> 01:58:35,676
Kind of a stare of daggers.

2789
01:58:35,676 --> 01:58:39,276
It was weird, too, because I remember going like I remember

2790
01:58:39,716 --> 01:58:41,636
coming out and going, man, what was that?

2791
01:58:41,876 --> 01:58:44,416
Like it was we were all shocked is what I'm saying.

2792
01:58:44,756 --> 01:58:46,536
We were all surprised at what I said.

2793
01:58:46,696 --> 01:58:48,816
Yeah. Or how I said it.

2794
01:58:49,256 --> 01:58:52,076
Boy, the pre-show jitters, I think, just made

2795
01:58:52,076 --> 01:58:54,816
unnecessary sarcasm explode out of you.

2796
01:58:54,816 --> 01:58:55,796
It happened. I'm sorry.

2797
01:58:55,796 --> 01:58:58,236
Because we felt a lot of pressure because this was the first.

2798
01:58:58,236 --> 01:58:59,416
Right. Second gate.

2799
01:58:59,436 --> 01:59:01,636
And we wanted to deliver and we hope you enjoyed it.

2800
01:59:01,656 --> 01:59:06,436
Forcing Mike to relive his childhood tummy troubles, you know, and brain trouble

2801
01:59:06,436 --> 01:59:07,536
and brain.

2802
01:59:07,716 --> 01:59:08,996
All that's so true.

2803
01:59:09,576 --> 01:59:12,296
It's just our every podcast is a brain trouble.

2804
01:59:12,716 --> 01:59:14,496
Yeah. Revealing their brain troubles.

2805
01:59:14,596 --> 01:59:17,496
There's a lot of weird psychosis in all of these experiences,

2806
01:59:17,496 --> 01:59:19,396
and we'll delve into all that.

2807
01:59:19,816 --> 01:59:23,396
So as always, follow us to podcast the right on Twitter

2808
01:59:23,396 --> 01:59:25,716
and email us to podcast the right at Gmail.

2809
01:59:25,796 --> 01:59:29,096
But with the with the specific thing, seriously, if there's things that you

2810
01:59:29,096 --> 01:59:30,716
want to hear us do

2811
01:59:30,716 --> 01:59:36,176
with the second gate, send us mailbag questions, send us lost and found ideas.

2812
01:59:36,176 --> 01:59:38,276
And put that stuff in the subject line.

2813
01:59:38,436 --> 01:59:39,976
That always helps. Lost and found.

2814
01:59:40,716 --> 01:59:42,096
Or organized. Yeah.

2815
01:59:42,656 --> 01:59:47,716
It's we want you to put the the topics into different zones

2816
01:59:47,716 --> 01:59:52,116
so that we can very cleanly organize them in our mind.

2817
01:59:52,356 --> 01:59:54,836
Right. So remember, the zones are different than the levels.

2818
01:59:54,876 --> 01:59:59,516
Right. So right what level it is and right what zone it is and what color it is as well,

2819
01:59:59,516 --> 02:00:02,836
because there's also color that corresponds to the zones, but not the levels.

2820
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:04,476
The levels don't have a specific color.

2821
02:00:04,596 --> 02:00:09,016
Yes. And our tag colors, we're tagging email.

2822
02:00:09,136 --> 02:00:10,736
That's actually different than the colors.

2823
02:00:10,836 --> 02:00:12,616
But you don't have to worry about that.

2824
02:00:12,736 --> 02:00:15,176
That's our burden to bear. Yeah, we'll take care of that.

2825
02:00:15,196 --> 02:00:19,556
But we can't we have a lot on our plates and we can't be the navigators to navigate

2826
02:00:19,556 --> 02:00:23,816
for us, would you? Yeah. All right. Well, we'll see you.

2827
02:00:23,816 --> 02:00:25,836
See you in the next zone. Bye.
