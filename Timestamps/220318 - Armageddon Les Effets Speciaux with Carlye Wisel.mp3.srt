00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning, the following podcast contains

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
sad French burgers

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
lightning McQueen's digestive system

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
face fire

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and an attraction that strains relationships

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that attraction being Disneyland Paris's

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Armageddon, Les Effets Spatiaux

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We drill into this massive

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
asteroid of a topic

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
with a returning Carly Weisel

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on today's podcast

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Ride

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Intro Music

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the theme park podcast where because of

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
today's attraction we say go ahead

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and close your eyes

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
go ahead and fall asleep

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because we assure you, you won't miss a

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
thing. My name is Mike Carlson

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
joining me as always Jason

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sheridan. Hi.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm just soaking that all in

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because I was going to respond to whatever

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you were saying with ah the

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
French, the French theme parks

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
have always been celebrated for their

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
excellence.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There is a certain attraction

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that is very terrible.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Walt Disney Studios Park has always

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
knows a thing or two about excellence.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well we should, I really should have worked on a

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
French accent for this. But Scott Garner

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
do you have a French accent? Do you have?

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well I did look up how to pronounce

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the attraction

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
which if this is the place

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
for that. Well and there's

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
another French pronunciation that might

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
come into play later but today we

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
are talking about Armageddon

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Les Effets Spatiaux

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There we go. So I wanted to get

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that right. I'm sure it was still wrong in some way.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wait, with less?

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I probably said less didn't I?

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You said less, yes.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No that's completely correct.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Effets Spatiaux.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay so I, alright. I did screw it up.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's not the part I thought I would.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
12 words from high school French. I'm sure I've repeated them on the show before.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
an Orangina, the Orangina

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
drink. That counts?

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh yeah, yes of course.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a French drink.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know, it's hard to say what time

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is it. Ask what time it is.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Kelerateel? That's how, what time is it?

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And you need to say that

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as American as possible.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Kelerateel?

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Kelerateel?

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Like an American nerd

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
would say it is how I'm saying it.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Kelerateel!

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's the

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
did I do that pronunciation.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, so we'll be doing

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know, there's not that much French stuff

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I guess. Well if we talk about Disneyland Paris

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I guess there is but

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
specifically like French stuff.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well it is where we are today.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are talking, but then this one probably requires

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
explanation from the ground up

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that at the Walt Disney

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Studios park

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in Paris, that for a long time

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
there was an attraction based on Armageddon

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and we'll explain why this

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
came up recently on Twitter

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
with our guest today who I'm so happy

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is returning. I believe your fifth

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
podcast The Ride appearance.

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Long overdue. I think so.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I got you to punch car. Welcome to five.

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We got something to give you

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
on your sixth. Five

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
timers club. I know. Five timers club.

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is much more fun than doing

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SNL I'm sure. Yeah.

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For sure. I think you're in this breezy

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
garage. For our podcast, very amusing

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it's Carly Weisel. Hi. Hello, hi!

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I am both thrilled

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and mildly upset that we have to

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
discuss this attraction.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
At length. Sorry

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to everyone listening. It's

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh boy. We're really going to polish

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
a turd here. It's going to make

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
us as cantankerous as a late in

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
life drunk horse and wells trying to

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
read commercial copy.

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, you're absolutely

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
right. Well, yeah, you walked in. I mean, we've

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
been trying to figure out the right thing to have you and did we

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
find it? I don't know. Maybe it's not it.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's a horrible reason to have you. Who is

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
this? I feel like I come on here a lot

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and I'm yelling about things and some people

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
agree and some people don't. Sometimes in this very

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
room or garage. And this

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is something that I don't believe I've ever

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
heard a single person stan.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know anybody who's like

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that thing was cool.

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, unless

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know. Let's do the check.

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is there a secret? Is there a hidden

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
stan in this room?

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In the room? In today's attraction, yeah.

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've got a surprise. Oh no.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, I'm just kidding. This

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
one sucks.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm pretty forgiving.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I try to find like, well, but I did like

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
this. I there's

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
one little odd moment where I was

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
like, well, that's an interesting

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
there's a lot of interesting stuff.

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think it's the most forgiving word you

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
could use. It's all interesting.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'd say confusing is the more frank way

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
of putting it. Oh, absolutely.

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Literally, because even going back and watching

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it, I couldn't view the translation

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
screen in portions of it

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and did not know what they were saying. Oh, yeah.

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean, the translation screen alone is

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
very, very much your

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
choice. A lot of choices

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
made, a lot of very confusing choices.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Even the premise, I was like, that can't be

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
what this it is. What? OK, that

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
is what they're setting us up for. Got it.

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Pretty baffling. I imagine it was

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
even like videos are

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
tough to parse, but you did do this in person

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
at one point in time. Oh, yeah.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I will never live it down

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
because I dragged my

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
husband to Disneyland Paris. It was my first

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
visit there. I think it was 2016.

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So we took a full day

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to go to the parks, which he was already

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
not on board with. And we

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
were like Armageddon, first ride we saw

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
at Walt Disney Studios. Let's give it

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
a shot. Started there.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then it kept waiting for the ride to

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
start. And then we exited.

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah. Oh, totally.

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes. Well, especially

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
now. And we'll explain what it all

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is. But this is it is

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
an attraction where you're in a space

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
transport vehicle,

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
essentially. And there's stuff going on.

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You see space through the screens.

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And that is something that now

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in several cases qualifies

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
as a pre-show, a kind

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of exciting pre-show in both

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Galaxy's Edge and the Star Cruiser

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
experience. But yeah,

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you might watch this and go, okay,

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
so now the door's open and the ride starts.

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, no, no.

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This was not a different situation in the early

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
2000s. This sufficed

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
for them. Yeah. And this is

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
this park is was made because

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
of a contractual obligation.

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Essentially, the whole park was that they had

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
made a promise to Paris,

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to the people of France, to the French

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
government. And that they what is this deal

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
where they had to give up the

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
land if they didn't fill

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
it with a park. Some

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
yeah. Perhaps they should

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
have. Yeah, maybe if

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you don't have a good idea, although there's

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
also the flip side, because I genuinely

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
was thinking should they just not

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
have. But now they have all these grand

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
plans and I don't know how they're progressing,

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
but that kind of makes you think, well, maybe

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you just put your foot in the door,

207
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
get a half park or

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
less on the table and

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
then down the road you end up because this is

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
going to be the home of Galaxy's Edge and

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
some frozen stuff. And what's the other

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Marvel? Avengers Campus. Oh yeah, Avengers Campus,

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
which is replacing what we're

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
talking about. Do you

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
does that make sense? Like maybe it is

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
good that they. I mean,

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I went in November.

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's the last time I was there. It's a Disneyland Paris

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and it's just I mean, it was a

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
dirt pile because so

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
much of the park, you know, to build all those

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
lands, they just had to raise

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
so much. Yeah, I went in

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and I walked around and went, oh, that's that's it

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
now. That's it. There is nothing here

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because it's all under construction. Were they

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
using the vehicle, the armadillo

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to raise the ground

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
up just out

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
in front. They used to be out in front, I should

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
say the vehicle from Armageddon. Mike,

232
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
why did you even say vehicle? We all know what

233
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the armadillo Armageddon

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Armadillo Armadillo

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and I assume we all like that's what Harry Stamp

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and the crew like bear

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and bear. Michael Clark. All the characters

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
we know. Yeah.

239
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I yeah. And we and we of course

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
also all know that this is a Disney movie.

241
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We I think we all we see the logo

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
for Armageddon and we all think

243
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Disney straight to that.

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's definitely not just a it is a

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they happen to own it. It's a late 90s

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
touchstone movie.

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OK, it's a touchstone. All right. How much longer

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
did Touchstone go for? I feel I don't

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't feel like it was long for this world

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in the late 90s. I kind of didn't think about Touchstone

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
falling apart. I don't know when that

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I feel like they just retired the brand a few

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
years later. Yeah, I guess so. Or just

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
rolled into something else. Maybe they rolled

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it into Miramax because they bought Miramax

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
later in the 90s. I like Touchstone.

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I like seeing that little like circle go by

258
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
in the bar and when

259
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you say I like Touchstone, you mean I like the logo

260
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I like the logo. That would happen before the movie.

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have a question for you. Does the

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what brings you more joy the Touchstone logo

263
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
or this attraction?

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, the logo. The logo for sure. Yeah, yeah. All it's got

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to do is fill that three seconds and then like

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't remember what anything to Touchstone

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
was adventures in babysitting Touchstone

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
potentially. Maybe. Something I like

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is Touchstone. So so like

270
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
it is the Touchstone logo is a pre-show

271
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
for something good as opposed to this

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
attraction. Is there something Spielberg-y?

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes. Yeah. Probably.

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
God, it's killing me. What is it? Why can't I name?

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I guess I guess Touchstone's not that

276
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
great of a brand if I can't think

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
of one. But the only I like all

278
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
these logos too, but the only thing I remember as a

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
kid was that I knew if it was New Line

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Cinema, there was a good chance like the Ninja Turtles

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
were coming after that.

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I remember that like they played a

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
tape and I would be like New Line Cinema. That's

284
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
the company that makes Ninja Turtles.

285
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, they made Lincoln apparently.

286
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So a recent Spielberg-ish.

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So it went longer than I thought. Wild

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hogs, of course. Of course.

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Of course. I think Nightmare Before Christmas

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and Roger Rabbit released

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Undertowd Stone. Oh, yeah. Pretty woman.

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Was Old Dogs?

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Robin

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Williams John Travolta movie that I get confused

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
with Wild Hogs? That I don't know.

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And which one killed the other, the sequel

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to the other? Old Dogs made

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
there be no Wild Hogs too.

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think. Oh, okay. I believe

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
so. And then Old Dogs

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
has the Travolta Every

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Little Step music video with his daughter.

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think so. Yeah. Okay.

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Which if you've never seen it, I highly recommend it.

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, yeah, boy. Check it out. Do you want

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to guess at the

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
highest grossing touchstone film?

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I see I have it in front of me. Somebody

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
else. Mike Carley. I would like to not guess.

310
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No. Okay. I would like

311
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
for it to be Pretty Woman, but Pretty

312
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Woman comes in at number five. Number one is

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Signs. Interesting.

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Signs.

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Armageddon and Pearl

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Harbor two and three.

317
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So kind of the ones that showed

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
up in the theme parks, I feel like,

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
because Pearl Harbor

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
was kind of incorporated into the

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
pre-show stuff at the studio tour and MGM

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
studios. It's in this a little in

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the pre-show of this.

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Before we dive

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
into the attraction a little more, I am like

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
first of all, one

327
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
thing is this attraction is opened

328
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
20 years ago this week.

329
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So that makes it appropriate here to talk about

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
as did this entire park,

331
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the studios park next to Disneyland

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Paris proper, which is almost 30 years

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
old. Carley, you've been in the recent

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
past and I feel like it seems like your experiences

335
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
were pretty good.

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. You're a fan

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
recently. I would say that pandemic

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
era Disneyland Paris

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
is different. It's a different

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
because if we're comparing everything on

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
even playing field, like we got the Tokyo

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
parks in here, we

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
can't do that anymore. You literally can't

344
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
go to Tokyo. I don't even know how you would get into

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hong Kong or Shanghai. There's not a chance.

346
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't know. I haven't looked into this at all.

347
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So much of my not thinking. You can't

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
casually. I mean, I went to China

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
December 2019.

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Like basically the last

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
plane out didn't realize it and you

352
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
still have to go to the Chinese consulate

353
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
to get a visa to go into

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
China. Just to go at all. Just to go.

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So it wasn't easy to

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
visit in the first place. Now not a chance.

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So when you're looking at it, you're kind of like

358
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
we got Florida, we got California, we got Paris.

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Paris is the only like spice in the mix

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
that we got. It's the only fun foreign one.

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like the hotels

362
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
are enough for you, but there's no rides

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
at the hotels. So

364
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know if this will be the case as this episode

365
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
comes out. But when I started reading about this

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
attraction, Hong Kong was closed.

367
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The Hong Kong park was closed because they

368
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
had done. Oh, like this

369
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
week essentially. Yeah.

370
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A few days ago. A few days

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
was closed. Shanghai, I think

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
partially closed. Maybe the hotels

373
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and stores and the shopping area

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
open. Okay.

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, rides are down. That weird.

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We had for a little bit. Interesting. Okay.

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay. So this is like, yeah,

378
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
if you want something that's not the norm and you go

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
to these places a lot. Yeah. So

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it really shook it up. Because usually it's like

381
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
look at all these foreign options. And now it's

382
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Paris or nothing. And

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Paris, I'm someone who took the pandemic

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
very seriously. And so for

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
me, I felt much safer being in Paris

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
because there was a vaccine check that was required

387
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
of everyone. Everyone was required to wear masks

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
outdoors and indoors.

389
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Which when I went, I went twice

390
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
last year, which sounds

391
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
ridiculous.

392
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I was like, I'm getting it back.

393
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I went over the summer and I went in

394
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
November. I think I made it go on like late September,

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
November. So. In both areas, like we're

396
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
still a little dicey. You know,

397
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
summer got okay for a second. Well in France, it was

398
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
great. Wow, wow. Yeah. Because they,

399
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, they masked 100%.

400
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I remember going in a department store, which is usually

401
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
a little loosey goosey. And every single

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
person was wearing a mask. Wow.

403
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So like going to the park was nice because you

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
could actually absorb the theming without

405
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
even thinking about what was happening. Geez.

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, that's great. Yeah. So it painted Paris

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
in this different light. But then

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
again, I found myself screaming at someone

409
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in my family because I was so hungry because there was

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
no food. That was my,

411
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
because I've spoken ill of

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Paris a lot. I'm the only one of

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the three of us who's done it.

414
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And there were things that I liked about it

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and that I will praise

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
down the road. But the

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
big obstacle was the food thing.

418
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And we did a whole episode about that, the

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
village there, city walk,

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and Disney, which is, I found miserable,

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
just crushingly miserable.

422
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Did you, did you find any way around?

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There's like not even, no sector keeper

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
would be willing to exist.

425
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They'd be like, get me the fuck out of here.

426
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Somebody, I'm transferring

427
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
out of this. Somebody else take this assignment.

428
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, it's pretty

429
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
grim. Did you find any ways around?

430
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are there any weird secret,

431
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
if you want to survive it in a culinary

432
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
sense? Yes.

433
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I found out about it too late, but I realized

434
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the best thing to do is to completely

435
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
exit property and go

436
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
into the train station.

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Because the train station has

438
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
like, what is it, like,

439
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Pré-de-manger or whatever those things are called.

440
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like a little sandwich shop.

441
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You find yourself in a position going,

442
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it's like, oh, thank God, a Pré.

443
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Nice. Yes. Literally

444
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
yes. Something with standards.

445
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I mean, I had,

446
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I mean, this is off topic, but I had

447
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
maybe the worst Disney meal I've ever had

448
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
in my entire life at the

449
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Disney's Hotel New York

450
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Art of Marvel. Really?

451
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, wow. My worst one also,

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
there, I was wondering if you were going to head for

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
California Grill, which it's

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
insane, they call it the same thing. It's a very

455
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
stuffy restaurant in the Disneyland

456
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hotel proper. Awful, awful,

457
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
inedible food for so much money.

458
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah.

459
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And we waited forever. Miserable,

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
miserable experience. What was up with this place?

461
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So everything else I ate was fine,

462
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
edible. Like, the line is edible.

463
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I had a nice dinner at the

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Manhattan restaurant where you

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
sit underneath a chandelier that looks like

466
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Asgard, which was very fun.

467
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So like, I had a great meal there,

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
but the downtown restaurant

469
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
was all, it was buffet

470
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
style, but it was COVID, so they brought plates

471
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
of it to your table.

472
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And so you didn't know what anything looked like, and you were just kind of out here

473
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
taking a guess, and everything was themed

474
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
to different downtown areas in Manhattan,

475
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
so there was quote unquote

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
dim sum, and there were

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
like different cuisines from different places

478
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that have different, you know, like Little Italy and things

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
like that. And I

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
honestly don't, I don't know if I

481
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
actually consumed any food at the meal.

482
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You didn't pick anything.

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It was so bad that my mom

484
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
asked for an allergy meal,

485
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
which was a frozen microwave meal

486
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that took 20 minutes to arrive.

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh my god. Because she has a specific

488
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
diet for her health, but even still was like

489
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't eat this.

490
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You've made me feel better.

491
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've started to wonder, like, where my wife and I were,

492
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
was I being a baby? Absolutely not.

493
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, it is bad. It's really bad there.

494
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, yeah. And you're just, you're walking

495
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
around that mall, just like which,

496
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
what place do I get inedible

497
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
ribs from? Where am I, like,

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I just pick your poison. There's nothing

499
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
that seemed like, I know I'm not getting

500
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
something good. It's just what, what can I

501
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
survive with? Yeah.

502
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This kind of sounds like my parents'

503
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
experience of, like,

504
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the dining options at Disney World

505
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
in, like, 1990.

506
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Exactly. Alright, I guess I'll

507
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
eat another slice of pizza. Like,

508
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I guess I'll have another hamburger.

509
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like, you know. Yeah, which it doesn't,

510
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
it is not like that anymore.

511
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's been a huge change

512
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
in, especially Disney,

513
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but I'd say Universal to some extent.

514
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Universal seemingly upping their food

515
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
game in Orlando the last few years.

516
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A friend of mine just posted a photo of ramen

517
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that she got, and I think

518
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Islands of Adventure. What? Ramen.

519
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wingservice Ramen. Where?

520
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There's CityWalk has a bun

521
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
stand serving fusion, like

522
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
bao buns. I did, that's not

523
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
very good, but it's a nice idea.

524
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Nice, yeah.

525
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We applaud the effort. Thank you for trying.

526
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Thank you. Not, well, I ate worse things

527
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
at Disney Paris, so it's okay.

528
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The food in the park is

529
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
better if it's open. If the food

530
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
is open, then you're good.

531
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But everything's closed. Everything's closed.

532
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So that hasn't changed, because

533
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I was there in 2014

534
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and there was nothing related to pandemic

535
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
then, so, like, what, why,

536
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
why is it always like this? What's

537
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
up with this place? Honest to God, I have no idea,

538
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and this time I was like, I'm gonna go prepare it.

539
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Like, I'm gonna beat the system, and

540
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I made table service reservations

541
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
in the park during the day, and so

542
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
we ate, and the food wasn't

543
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
that bad. We went to kind of a Moroccan

544
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
restaurant, which was shockingly

545
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
good, or edible.

546
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But the other,

547
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I mean, it's a crap shoot. I

548
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
have been four times

549
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
now, and the other two times I went,

550
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I had at least one meal that was

551
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
pick and mix candy.

552
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
To the point. Oh, so like how Mike

553
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and I eat regularly. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

554
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They call that cereal around here. Yeah, I

555
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
like waddled in this time like, I know where I'm getting

556
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
my lunch at, and I went, and

557
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
all of it is gone.

558
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Just, because they're like, pandemic, all

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
of the candy is gone. Oh, no.

560
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Wow. Wow. That's like play

561
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
testing for their kind

562
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
of domestic COVID cutbacks

563
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
in dining that seems

564
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to be, the wave seems

565
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to be slowly rolling back.

566
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Like things slowly

567
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
opening up more here in America.

568
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You would think, like you would think that

569
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
would be a thing, because for a

570
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
famously maligned

571
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
park, you would think that would be a draw,

572
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
at least for the older people that were

573
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
skeptical of the park in general, like, oh, well,

574
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
it does have some nice places to eat.

575
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Like, you would think that might have been a good draw,

576
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but I guess they never considered

577
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
it. I don't know. I've even

578
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
gone to Walt's, which is like their,

579
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
it's not Club 33, but it's their like finest

580
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
dining restaurant in the park, and you're

581
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
on the second floor of Main Street, and it's very

582
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
beautiful, and I think I spent

583
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
over $60 on a burger.

584
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh my god. And they gave me

585
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
nine fries.

586
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is it exclusive? It is. No.

587
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay. So you can just make a reservation.

588
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, to people who love wasting money.

589
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah,

590
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that's what, it's like so

591
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
crazily more expensive

592
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
than fine dining in

593
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the great city, 20

594
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
minutes away. Absolutely. But this time,

595
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
so the last trip we went on in November,

596
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
we went to a sandwich place,

597
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and we got little baguette sandwiches

598
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
from this little man who made like

599
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
slapped butter on the bread and then put

600
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
on a bunch of meat, and I carried them in a brown

601
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
bag to the park, and I ate them on a bench,

602
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and it was heaven.

603
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Wow. Nice. So that's the move.

604
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Just bringing in from entirely, it cannot

605
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
be Disney controlled.

606
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They have like just whittled

607
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
the taste out of anything. You need off-land

608
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
food. Yeah, yeah.

609
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Um,

610
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
well, that's nuts. Did you find stuff

611
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
to like about, that's I guess a question

612
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
because I, you know,

613
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
like the bones of that,

614
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
of the Magic Kingdom style

615
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
park I think are wonderful, but then

616
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
there's that food

617
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and lack of staffing drawback,

618
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and then Paris is all,

619
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sorry, the Studios Park is a whole mess,

620
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but it's improved. How's

621
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
it feeling in 2021?

622
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Were you charmed by anything

623
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
about the place? Yeah, it definitely feels on the up

624
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and up. When I've been before, it's like, oh,

625
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
right, this is the one the company is embarrassed

626
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
about. Like you forget about it. Yeah. But

627
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
they're just sinking so much money into

628
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Walt Disney Studios Park that it

629
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
feels like, like there's more to come,

630
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and it felt very

631
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
optimistic. Okay.

632
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And I also had a really nice time. Like I really

633
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
appreciated some of the things they do differently,

634
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
like just the way it's laid out.

635
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I got lost at one point

636
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
because the left side

637
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
of the park is just, who knows,

638
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
just all over the place. You just keep walking and walking

639
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and you like never reach anything.

640
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And then they had like such good character

641
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
meet and greets and fun

642
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
costumes. And I went to

643
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
some Mexican restaurant and I got a margarita

644
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in Disneyland,

645
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
which was very fun. Sure. Oh, you're talking

646
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in the main, oh, interesting. Yeah, like in

647
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Disneyland. Right, yes. That was

648
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
where my enthusiasm went, where I was getting a

649
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
beer in the saloon in Frontierland.

650
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like that feels pretty good.

651
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So that's a, yeah, yeah, that's a genuine...

652
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It was fun. I had a good time. I think once they build

653
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
out the other half and they have something new, like

654
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the Frozen attraction, stuff that we don't

655
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
have in America, I think it'll be,

656
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I think it's, I mean, I think it's gonna come around.

657
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's on the way. Can you get a

658
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
beer in Tokyo in the main park?

659
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Or no?

660
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Don't think so. I'm sure we've all talked about this and I know

661
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the answer somewhere. I don't know. It's been so... I can't remember.

662
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I only recall doing it in Disney

663
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Sea. How many parks, how many

664
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Magic Kingdoms can you drink and make Walt's

665
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
skeleton cry?

666
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's my question really. Is it only, is it

667
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
just Florida and Paris?

668
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
They're sinning. They're sinners.

669
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
His old bones

670
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
tear up still in the ground.

671
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Carly, let me ask you, cause I

672
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
had a very hard time finding the current

673
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
answer to this question. Can you still

674
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
smoke within the parks in

675
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Disneyland Paris? Because I mean,

676
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I wrote down a joke about the

677
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
French smoking inside the

678
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
waiting area for Armageddon. Like

679
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
you can hear their disinterest

680
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and they're dangling cigarettes. And I was like,

681
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
what is the smoking policy in France?

682
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And as of 2017,

683
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I found an article just

684
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
labeled Disneyland Paris to

685
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
enforce use of designated

686
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
smoking areas. So they had smoking

687
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
areas and they were not

688
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but we were still just lighting

689
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
up everywhere as of a few years

690
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
ago. I don't know if COVID has changed

691
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that. I don't smoke.

692
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't want to smoke. I've maybe had

693
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
like one cigarette in my life, but I would smoke

694
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
a cigarette on Pirates of the Caribbean

695
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
in any park and be thrilled.

696
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, that's cool. I will

697
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
drive down right now to Anaheim

698
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and smoke a cigarette on Pirates

699
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and it will be

700
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
one of the best experiences of my life.

701
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I didn't see as much smoking. I don't know

702
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
if the masks were a deterrent cause

703
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
they were required outdoors both times I was there.

704
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But I do remember

705
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
the time I went before that, which was a few

706
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
years ago. I mean, I believe the trash

707
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
cans still have ashtrays on top.

708
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Right. So you're not like, they're not really

709
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
saying no if you're

710
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
just laying out everything

711
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you might need to smoke wherever you'd

712
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
like. Yeah, there were some trip advisor

713
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
reviews too of what seemed like

714
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Americans or British going like

715
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I was in line for something and someone

716
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
just started smoking in the queue

717
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
next to me.

718
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm like, uh huh. Yeah, that

719
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
sounds right. I'm kind of glad they didn't cause they

720
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
had all those partitions, which I feel I could

721
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
have very easily caught fire.

722
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Like in a Fantasyland switchback.

723
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

724
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I didn't even think about it.

725
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Such a hazard. But

726
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
yeah, I mean, people still be smoking.

727
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But not to the comical

728
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
extent I once witnessed.

729
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Not to the Looney Tunes

730
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
level. Smoking a pack on a ride.

731
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Five at once in Bugs Buddies mouth.

732
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Turning dark green. Yeah.

733
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

734
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Snooty laughter. There wasn't a lot of snooty

735
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
laughter with cigarettes. They only light

736
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
up when the national anthem starts to play.

737
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's their version of putting their hand on their

738
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
heart.

739
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Here's the Studios Paris

740
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
question. Cause there's something I've thought

741
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
about proposing an episode on this and I don't

742
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
know if there's enough there or if people want to hear it.

743
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But I'm really intrigued by this.

744
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So one of the weird things about the Studios

745
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Park is that

746
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
opening

747
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
day attractions. Armageddon is one and

748
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
another one is the Studio

749
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Backlot Tour.

750
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Common thing, you know,

751
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
at Universal Hollywood and the Florida Studio

752
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
parks that opened where you go take a tour

753
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
of the studio, the working studio.

754
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This was never a studio.

755
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Nothing has ever been filmed here

756
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
other than one weird thing I found,

757
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
which I'll talk about at the end. But

758
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
so you're touring a non-existent

759
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
backlot and this has always been

760
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a weird why is this there? We didn't even

761
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
do it. Like we knew we'd already experienced

762
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
enough misery. Like we know what this is going to be.

763
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But they changed

764
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
it. Now it's something called Cars

765
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Road Trip.

766
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And it's still OK for people who know the

767
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Disney World Tour

768
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
that culminates in a thing called

769
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Catastrophe Canyon where you go into kind

770
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
of a Red Rock Canyon. You experience

771
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
a big disaster scene and then see

772
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
how it was faked and how they did it behind

773
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the facades. But it's

774
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
explosions and a gas truck and all

775
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
this stuff. And they had that.

776
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But now they've made that

777
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
part of a Cars

778
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
thing where it seems

779
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
like it's all they've done is put a big

780
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
smiling mouth on the gas

781
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
truck. That's right.

782
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And in the concept art too, the big

783
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Mack truck is like on fire

784
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and smiling.

785
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's a

786
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
depiction of that this is fine

787
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
dog on Twitter.

788
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's a template of that.

789
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Was this weird thing going?

790
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Did you get to experience this?

791
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yes, I did wait in line for this. Oh boy.

792
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh great. I did wait in like a 25

793
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
minute line.

794
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Wow. What can you tell us?

795
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I mean I needed to know.

796
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
There's a loose

797
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
narrative which I have to like

798
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I have to applaud them for.

799
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
For them figuring out a way to make this thing

800
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Cars themed. Yeah. But

801
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
it was very loose.

802
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Like it wasn't very

803
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
compelling. But I'll tell

804
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
you I went with my mom and she had a

805
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
great time. Oh that's cool. She was

806
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
delighted by it. Okay. That's something.

807
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So you know all that stuff

808
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
happening in Catastrophe Canyon doesn't

809
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
quite make sense.

810
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
In the cars road trip

811
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
purview. But what's happening

812
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
before that? Yeah that's my question. I think

813
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I watched a video in this there's like narration

814
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or do you get videos on like custom

815
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
videos or no?

816
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I was severely under

817
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
caffeinated when I did it. But I

818
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
do remember that I think there

819
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
was audio and I think they were

820
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
basically like we're going on a road trip to different

821
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
stops. And so I think

822
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Catastrophe Canyon was like a sightseeing

823
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
destination. Oh god.

824
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Where everything explodes.

825
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What was it before? Like would they be like

826
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
they just say a name like empty nest was filmed

827
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
here. Was that the lie? Like was that how it

828
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
worked before? I don't really

829
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
know. I know that the big center

830
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
piece was a bunch of sets from

831
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
another I want to say a touchstone

832
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
movie called Rain of Fire.

833
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay. I do remember this

834
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
now. Yeah Matthew McConaughey and the

835
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Dragons in London. Is that right?

836
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh yeah it's a re-creation of London.

837
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I didn't know Matthew McConaughey. I always knew

838
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Christian Bale. He got a crazy beard and a

839
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
shaved head. So they would lie

840
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
about Rain of Fire having shot there?

841
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes. They did have the sets but

842
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
they just plopped them in this French

843
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
field. Okay. So it was not

844
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
but it was the real things from a movie

845
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that people didn't really see or like.

846
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That was a

847
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
late late summer

848
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
2001-2002

849
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
release. I just remember

850
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
like getting ready to like go

851
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
back to school. And

852
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but seeing so they put all the

853
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
marketing. There was no

854
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
no other movies like coming out

855
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
seemingly. And so all the commercials

856
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
were like and you gotta check out

857
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Rain of Fire folks.

858
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I have zero. I can't picture a poster.

859
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I don't know anything about

860
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and you're like well I'm going back to school. Everybody's

861
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
gonna be talking about Rain of Fire.

862
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm not gonna make any friends this year

863
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
if I don't. My media diet

864
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
was much different from yours growing

865
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
up. I mean I was a

866
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
for a few years there I was in Axis

867
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hollywood every night kind of.

868
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Whoa.

869
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Not ET.

870
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Not entertainment tonight.

871
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Somebody had a crush on Nancy. He was very discerning.

872
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No.

873
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I like the electronic

874
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
charisma of Pat O'Brien.

875
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh yeah were you

876
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
what happened when the tapes came out?

877
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I was buried as one in

878
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Pat. All the Axis Hollywood

879
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
hosts have tapes.

880
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Push head tapes. Oh yeah you're right.

881
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Everybody's gotching.

882
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't remember what the Pat O'Brien

883
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
tapes was. Bad right?

884
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Well it was just he was revealing

885
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
some fetishes. And there was some

886
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
explicit language. So it's available

887
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
online if you want. I won't repeat

888
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
anything.

889
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm not gonna lead you there. Not a thing I think about

890
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
a lot. I'm just saying that I have

891
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
some recollection of what it is.

892
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
He didn't daunt on me to just get an entertainment

893
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
weekly subscription. Like it didn't

894
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
daunt on me that that would have been. I was an entertainment

895
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
weekly kid. Oh me too.

896
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh yeah. Oh and what is

897
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Owen Gleiberman think?

898
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We were very invested in old

899
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Gleiberman's tapes. We seemed. What were you

900
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
doing that was not this?

901
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I think honestly like sneaking candy.

902
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Stealing?

903
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I was reading Jane Magazine.

904
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The best women's magazine

905
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that's ever existed. That was my only

906
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
career goal and they went out of business the year

907
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
before I could get an internship. Oh really?

908
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah. Whoa. So all

909
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I do now is just me grasping at straws

910
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
because Jane Magazine no longer exists.

911
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You're trying to have a Jane

912
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
esque vibe in whatever

913
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
venue. I mean I had one career goal

914
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and it went out the window and I'm just

915
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
seeing what happened since then. Can you?

916
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That was started by someone

917
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
notable right? Didn't it? Yes.

918
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Oh why am I blanking out her name?

919
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I know this.

920
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Good gotcha question.

921
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Was her name Jane?

922
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Jane Pratt? Yes. Who's Jane Pratt?

923
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I know that name. I don't remember what Jane Pratt was about. Yes and then she had

924
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
XOJane.com which was like a

925
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
website version of it but it was recent

926
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and it wasn't the same.

927
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Can you reboot it? Is she alive?

928
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah but

929
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I mean not to. Can you get the IP?

930
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sure a venture capital firm

931
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that probably owns the IP

932
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
would love to partner with you. Seriously.

933
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean magazines are not a sustainable

934
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
form of income

935
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
because like print media plus

936
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
advertising not great but

937
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
ideally if they rebooted it

938
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I would run the other direction

939
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
from theme parks.

940
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So you would have banned theme parks completely?

941
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
If Jane Magazine came back?

942
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You would set the ride

943
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
on fire you were on and run

944
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Oh yeah I would extinguish my cigarette

945
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
on the side of the boat and then

946
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
just pounce.

947
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Well if you put it out there have you put it out

948
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
there publicly that you're willing you want to reboot

949
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
this? No because as someone

950
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
currently in the publishing industry I

951
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
understand why it's not rebooted. It's not the

952
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
train you want to jump on.

953
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

954
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Maybe you can reboot her talk

955
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
show. She had a talk show on Fox.

956
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh wow really? And she was the founder of

957
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Sassy Magazine. Yeah Sassy was

958
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
OG Jane Magazine. Oh okay.

959
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Wow. Sassy was cool too.

960
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I just know that sketch that Hartman's

961
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that might be one of the that's the top ten for me.

962
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Which one was that again?

963
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know he's the editor of Sassy Magazine.

964
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Is that one that he hosted? Sassy's Sassy

965
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Sassy S Boys.

966
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Where he draws a little map of

967
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the SS Sassy went to Sassy

968
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Island and I won't recap

969
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
this full.

970
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Wow. Well we've all said the

971
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
magazines we liked. Yeah

972
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
you're learning so much about us

973
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
every week. I

974
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
well I'm really excited to hear about

975
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Cars Road Trip. I'm glad

976
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
it was at least passed a mom approval test.

977
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There was this oh god I have

978
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to mention this there was this like food truck

979
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
but also I don't know to get real

980
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
heady with it I don't know where the food truck landed in

981
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
the vehicle

982
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
world of cars like I don't know if this food

983
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
truck was a car who was like serving human

984
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
food out of its car self. I'm not sure

985
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I didn't really think about it too existential

986
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
but it did have it was sponsored by Baby

987
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Bell Cheese and I feel like they had these

988
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
little like Baby Bell Cheese sandwiches

989
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
with cars and prints on them.

990
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh. And I didn't get one

991
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and I saw somebody when I was so jealous

992
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and I still am. That sounds good.

993
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I like those cheeses. That might have been a snack savior in this weird place.

994
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's like bunch of fun cars food

995
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that we don't have in America. Did the car

996
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
have a face? Did the food truck have a face?

997
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I feel like it did. Okay.

998
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So there was a human inside the

999
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
guts of a car. Yes standing inside

1000
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the anthropomorphic car

1001
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
hypothetically. Like in the intestines.

1002
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Kind of pushing its arms out through the intestines

1003
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
of the car and Baby Bell

1004
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Cheese Sandwiches. Yes. Serving hot little

1005
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
spreadable cheese sandwiches.

1006
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What is a food truck to you

1007
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
if you're being lit up on the inside?

1008
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Too much. Don't even

1009
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
worry your pretty little head with it. It is

1010
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
too much. That's what like. Ka-chow!

1011
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What have you got today?

1012
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You just

1013
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
went through the living room where my son

1014
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
watches Pixar movies all day

1015
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and like if you

1016
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think a lot of parents have to be this way.

1017
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Like if you have cars on a lot

1018
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
you have a new question every

1019
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
viewing. There's not one time that

1020
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
it's on. It's on hundreds of times.

1021
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah. Oh yeah. And I like

1022
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the new one for me is early on there's a

1023
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
race going on. It's showing everything around the stadium

1024
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and then there's a bathroom

1025
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and the men are just going straight

1026
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
in and the women it's a big long line.

1027
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You know like sporting events are. Sure.

1028
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
What are the cars doing in the bathroom?

1029
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What does a car

1030
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
need to do? Does anyone

1031
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
have any. I have

1032
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
fluid flush. Crass ideas

1033
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
about what it is. I suppose.

1034
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So because they like eat oil

1035
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
at an oil. It flows.

1036
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I think they go and eat oil and gas.

1037
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah they do.

1038
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So it's half. They're all like half

1039
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
well they're not half human but they're

1040
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
human car. Are they like

1041
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
are they defecating out the

1042
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
tailpipe or something?

1043
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What? Defecating what? What's coming

1044
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
out? Exhaust?

1045
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I guess it's just exhaust and oil?

1046
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Exhaust in front. They're exhausting

1047
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
all the time. Yeah exactly.

1048
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes. It's not a private matter. That's why I'm

1049
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
saying it's probably like

1050
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
some sort of version of like excrement.

1051
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Or like an oil change.

1052
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Is it like if there's like

1053
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
a well like you end up with like a gunky

1054
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
build up in the car.

1055
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah I mean.

1056
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The car's going by right now. Let's ask

1057
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
us sir. Yeah let's ask the car.

1058
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
They don't know either.

1059
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I mean they spent a lot of those movies

1060
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
cursing their existence at whatever sick

1061
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
god would make them this way.

1062
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's what it should be.

1063
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's just full and analyze.

1064
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I would just watch documentaries made in the car's

1065
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
verse about why.

1066
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Just why. Yeah.

1067
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Wasn't there? Didn't someone say that

1068
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
there's evidence in the movies of humans

1069
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
on the planet?

1070
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh like they're fossils right?

1071
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What? I can't remember what maybe

1072
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
it was a joke. I can't remember but I feel like there's somebody

1073
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
pointed out something in one of the movies

1074
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that there's like evidence that humans did live on this

1075
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
version of the earth at one point.

1076
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Geez. So I don't know.

1077
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Maybe that was a joke.

1078
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I wonder what the evidence is. If you're listening

1079
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and you know. All I want to do

1080
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
is think about cars. I'm broken

1081
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
by this question that you posed.

1082
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I can't go on.

1083
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really

1084
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm not happy with any

1085
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
answer. I mean if they are just like you know

1086
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
but they need but the oil

1087
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
maybe it's like us. We eat

1088
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
things and then some of it we use to power

1089
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
us but other some is

1090
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
waste. But what's waste for a car?

1091
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Do I use all of it?

1092
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
All right.

1093
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Look I think we're all a little freaked out.

1094
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Maybe we should get back to the rock

1095
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
rock solid storytelling

1096
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of 1998's Armageddon.

1097
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Clarity.

1098
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Simple ideas.

1099
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
What are you looking up Mike?

1100
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Bones. Well I'm looking up all the

1101
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
times that there's bones in cars.

1102
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
There's an article here that says the disturbing

1103
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
theory explains Pixar's cars.

1104
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But my phone is taking too long to

1105
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
have it load. So we can come back to

1106
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it. We don't have to do it. When we get to radiator, springs, racers

1107
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
we'll ignore the ride and focus on all

1108
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
this. But for now

1109
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
but the what we came here to do

1110
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
let me explain why we're

1111
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
doing this with you.

1112
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I was looking at Twitter and our

1113
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
friend Kevin Perger defunct land

1114
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
put out a prompt

1115
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and it was this. I am once again asking for

1116
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
suggestions for the worst theme

1117
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
slash amusement park ride you have ever been

1118
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
on that is now defunct.

1119
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I saw you responded and the

1120
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
response was Armageddon at

1121
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Walt Disney Studios Park. Yeah did not hesitate.

1122
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah you knew it.

1123
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh yeah in coming up with that decision you had

1124
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
no you didn't think about any other candidates.

1125
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It was like what color is this guy?

1126
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Just

1127
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
can't even if I tried to think of another attraction

1128
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
couldn't even think of one. Wow wow.

1129
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I got so excited

1130
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
because I like oh that's right that we haven't done

1131
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
that have we what an insane thing

1132
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and I feel so similar just baffled by

1133
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
it. Being in there in person doesn't

1134
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
help. Let me add that

1135
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Lentesta jumped on and

1136
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
added a response

1137
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
to you this. I left

1138
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
wondering if it was some sort

1139
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
of idiomatic French parody.

1140
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It was not. It was not.

1141
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So with this pile

1142
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
of opinions about this ride well this

1143
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
is some this is a podcast

1144
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the ride magnet. I think we got

1145
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
to dive in. Were you guys familiar with

1146
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
you knew this existed at least but maybe

1147
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
hadn't done the dive on it. No

1148
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't think I actually yeah I was new

1149
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the video is when I was watching I go I don't think

1150
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I've ever watched this before so it was

1151
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
on the radar but it was not I was

1152
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
not well versed. Sure. No I didn't

1153
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
know the specifics I knew it was

1154
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
there I had heard it was bad

1155
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and I briefly remember it MGM

1156
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
studios in Florida there was a

1157
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
little Armageddon

1158
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
thing like

1159
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
like videos or a walkthrough or

1160
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
something. I don't think it lasted very long.

1161
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
They had a making of space that

1162
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and things would change out but you got

1163
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
after in the

1164
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Twitter flurry that followed

1165
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Carly you got a response from

1166
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
somebody. Well explain what the. Yes

1167
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
so there was in the thread there is someone

1168
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
who is responding and fully

1169
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
being gaslit by everyone on the thread

1170
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
who's like that was never in Florida

1171
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and then they found a map that showed

1172
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it and they also called into my podcast

1173
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
very amusing and I was like you

1174
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
know what I'm going to put a pin in this this will be answered

1175
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
in the future I can't tell you where or when and

1176
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
this is that date but there was

1177
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
you were absolutely right there was

1178
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
a version of this I guess

1179
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
in studios in Florida.

1180
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah not I

1181
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
don't I remember seeing

1182
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
it very briefly it's not

1183
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
fully I don't think it was fully built out

1184
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
like it wasn't in a room

1185
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
space station and all this stuff

1186
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
yeah I don't think it had the full

1187
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
effects it was in the room

1188
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
with like like twister back

1189
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
draft which is this is kind of reminiscent

1190
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
of do you think they did anything do you think

1191
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
like they showed the here's the

1192
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
history of special effects which happened in

1193
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
this or the little Michael

1194
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Clark Duncan appearance.

1195
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think

1196
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
if they were going to I mean

1197
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
they put it in the American parks I think it was probably

1198
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
a lot more props and a lot

1199
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
of montages with the

1200
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
big movie stars

1201
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that are in Armageddon

1202
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but absent of the in this attraction.

1203
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes.

1204
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Other than the one you got one.

1205
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You got one you got a great performer show

1206
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
up and I'll

1207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
give the Russian guy you know

1208
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
that guy is he in the movie?

1209
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Is it Stormare?

1210
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Is it Peter Stormare? Who's the guy?

1211
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That's who I looked like in a blurry

1212
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Stormare type.

1213
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah I'm not totally sure.

1214
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I don't know.

1215
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So alright so there was some there was a little

1216
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
making of attraction but

1217
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
maybe not the full thing. I also recalled

1218
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
strongly the rumor

1219
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
that this was going into

1220
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
California Adventure and that it was

1221
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
maybe being considered as an opening

1222
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
either as an opening day or

1223
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
as what do we draft in

1224
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
quickly in the immediate

1225
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
decay of Superstar Lemmo?

1226
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Because there's that big space

1227
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
back there with it's that there's

1228
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
that weird building that was the who wants to be a millionaire

1229
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
thing and now it's like a they're just committed

1230
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
to being a store I guess.

1231
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's a Marvel thing now

1232
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I haven't seen it as a Marvel thing. Okay okay.

1233
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But I recall

1234
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
seeing in some online forum

1235
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
well there's a lot of good buzz about

1236
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
this Armageddon thing that's going

1237
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
into Paris so maybe they'll just draft

1238
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
that quickly into California

1239
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Adventure and that was still in my head

1240
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
when I walked up to

1241
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
the attraction in 2014

1242
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
was whatever commenter said

1243
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I heard this is good.

1244
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
2014. Yeah yeah.

1245
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That long after. Wow.

1246
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So I still I went in actually not

1247
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
knowing it was

1248
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
a disaster. I was like in

1249
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
my mind this could have been like oh maybe oh they actually

1250
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
like took the universal

1251
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
this formula of a little

1252
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
bit of behind the scenes and then you're thrust into the

1253
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
thing and took it to the next level.

1254
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That is what I was actually expecting

1255
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
when I walked in the room that day.

1256
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
As one I mean the facade is

1257
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
very like the logo is very enticing

1258
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and you're like this is going to be fun and adventurous

1259
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and you are truly standing

1260
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
in two rooms.

1261
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And that's it.

1262
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And one really claustrophobic hallway I remember

1263
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
connecting it's this really like depressing

1264
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
file through to

1265
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
like it's a long walk to that

1266
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
other. The sign looked like it was

1267
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
a little bit DCA though as far as

1268
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
like a thin

1269
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
like not so

1270
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
that's my. Your recollection?

1271
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's a little small

1272
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
on my screen here but this is

1273
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
this view kind of encapsulates

1274
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
what this park was like

1275
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
at least at the time. Where is

1276
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
this like kind of like

1277
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the tower of terror behind it.

1278
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Building and yeah and then the Armageddon

1279
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
logo is really just kind of

1280
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
it's very flat plastered on and you're looking at the

1281
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
back of the tower of terror which almost no

1282
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
park besides this

1283
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
do you have a view of and the back of it looks like

1284
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
nothing. Yeah. They didn't

1285
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
put the Hollywood tower

1286
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
sign on the other side it's just

1287
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
blank. I think it's still that

1288
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
way because they didn't expect to

1289
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
be doing that. Think about when this park

1290
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
opened. It's a really

1291
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
depressing opening line up where there's no tower

1292
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
of terror yet. Obviously there's no Rat Tatooie.

1293
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
There's no there's not this crush coaster

1294
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
which you said you like. Yeah I love crush coaster.

1295
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That seems cool. Yeah yeah. Wait that's another

1296
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
thing about like yeah that

1297
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
seems pretty neat. That reads in a

1298
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
ride through. And this sign does not

1299
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
have the outsider art appeal

1300
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
of the rock and roller coaster sign with the big

1301
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
CD. Ah, that Aerosmith.

1302
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah yeah yeah. Now that is

1303
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
it's yes it's at least

1304
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
so far in that direction

1305
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
that it is amusing. Yeah it

1306
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
went from being like

1307
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
okay yes CD is how we all listen

1308
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
to music in 2002 to an

1309
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
interesting an acronym when it

1310
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
closed in 2019.

1311
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Well it's like how those you know you

1312
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
go to the 50s hotel in

1313
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Disney World or the 50s wing

1314
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
of Pop Century and there's big records

1315
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and jukebox. It became an

1316
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
accidental 2002

1317
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
period piece way after the fact.

1318
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But again

1319
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
you know what I mean you bring up a good thing because

1320
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
these things were these odd facades

1321
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
in the back of Tower of Terror are all kind

1322
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
of in the same zone

1323
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
which in our rock and roller

1324
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
roller coaster episode I called Aerosmith

1325
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Alley. It really is

1326
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
like a full Aerosmith

1327
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
zone. Which is the only thing that makes me

1328
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
sad that this is gone now. Yeah.

1329
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Aerosmith had two attractions

1330
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
for Aerosmith. What a stronghold.

1331
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh my god. If you don't recall that

1332
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
they did the theme song of Armageddon

1333
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing as you quoted

1334
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
in the beginning. And you would

1335
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
hear their music I feel like in this

1336
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
whole so it kind of was like

1337
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
you know what is now going to be

1338
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
become Marvel

1339
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and Avengers. Yeah.

1340
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Wasn't what the Avengers of rock

1341
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
for sure yeah.

1342
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
A team up of the five greatest

1343
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
musicians on the planet Earth.

1344
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Wait that's that's the

1345
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
thing that I that I looked up and I'll probably

1346
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
screw up I'll screw this up

1347
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
because I screwed up the first pronunciation

1348
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
but here I looked up how to say this

1349
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
in French. Les mauvais gossons

1350
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
de Boston.

1351
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Les bad boys de Boston of course.

1352
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
In French.

1353
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
If you wanted to

1354
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
engage with some French people

1355
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
talk about the best of American culture.

1356
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
They were saying that phrase they were saying

1357
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
that phrase every day when they were out there.

1358
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Can I shout out to a friend of the show Julia Prescott for getting

1359
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
me Joey Kramer the drummer for

1360
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Aerosmith's coffee as a gift.

1361
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh. Recently.

1362
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
What's that called again?

1363
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm flanking on it.

1364
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's some rock thing.

1365
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Wow. Joey Kramer's rock coffee.

1366
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah let's call it. If I can

1367
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
toss out just a big picture thing

1368
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
about Armageddon

1369
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Leif-Expecio

1370
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
it opened in March

1371
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
2002 and closed

1372
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
in March 2019.

1373
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Which is 17 years.

1374
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It was open until 2019.

1375
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
2019. Like there's a world where I had

1376
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
an iPhone 11 and this thing was still

1377
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
open. Correct.

1378
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Get clear footage.

1379
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh yeah because you can look at the low

1380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
light. There's videos of this that are

1381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
immaculate actually on YouTube.

1382
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Very good HD.

1383
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Rocking and roasting coffee.

1384
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't know why I should have known.

1385
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And I probably could have gone

1386
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
through and made a list but the thing

1387
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
that stuck out to me I was like

1388
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
17 that's bigger than something

1389
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
right and I looked it up.

1390
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This lasted longer than Horizons.

1391
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Horizons was around

1392
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
less time. Even if you

1393
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
combine the first run of Horizons

1394
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and then it closed for a little while

1395
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and would operate seasonally and then of course

1396
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
it closed on the eve

1397
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
of the new millennium.

1398
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
If you add up the two runs

1399
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
of Horizons it is less than

1400
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
the one run of this attraction.

1401
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh my god.

1402
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's one of the longer running Disney attractions

1403
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
weirdly. It beat a lot.

1404
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It beat like probably not interspersed.

1405
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It beat like flying saucers.

1406
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think it was the ones that people had thought of that it

1407
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
beat. They must

1408
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
just have such a need

1409
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
to put people somewhere and so few

1410
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
attractions that they had

1411
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
to keep it open. Yeah.

1412
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Just no choice. Because there's very little

1413
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
to do at this park.

1414
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Now they're starting to close them because they have

1415
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
some better stuff and they're building better stuff.

1416
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Will be great in the future. Currently

1417
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
nothing. Yeah boy.

1418
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's grim. Grim decor

1419
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
wise.

1420
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And the dated

1421
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
well it also leads to like

1422
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Armageddon was a big movie but the cultural

1423
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
footprint of it by 2019

1424
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
is very slim.

1425
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

1426
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Not the size of Texas.

1427
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
If you want to check out Armageddon

1428
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and refresh yourself, boot up

1429
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
your Fubo app. That's where

1430
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it's currently streaming.

1431
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
We're all Fubo heads here.

1432
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah so much not Disney

1433
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
is this that it's not on Disney Plus.

1434
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yo yeah I didn't even think about

1435
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
that. Yeah weird.

1436
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Fubo. I feel like

1437
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
we've name checked a lot of them but

1438
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I don't think we've ever mentioned Fubo before.

1439
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Fubo I think is a mix of on

1440
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
demand and some live

1441
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
channels. Like I feel like

1442
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Pluto. Fubo is a

1443
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Pluto. Well let's

1444
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
not denigrate Pluto. Yeah yeah

1445
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I know. Pluto is solid. Yeah yeah.

1446
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I just found the Bob. There's a 24 7 Bob

1447
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Ross channel in Pluto

1448
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and it's really it is really relaxing.

1449
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I never really sat down and watched that show and I was

1450
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
like oh wow now I see

1451
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
like now I get it.

1452
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Very calm.

1453
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I one thing

1454
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
just before we move on from

1455
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
well who knows if we can we ever really

1456
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
move on from discussion of the bad boys

1457
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
of Boston. Of course yes. But I did find

1458
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
a video that affirms

1459
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
that the man himself

1460
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
was there. Visited Aerosmith alley

1461
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
when Aerosmith alley was still intact.

1462
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And this is from the

1463
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
this is from the Instagram

1464
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
account of Miss

1465
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Leva Little and that's

1466
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Liv Tyler. That's his daughter.

1467
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So they went together.

1468
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Recently.

1469
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
When was this? I thought. Or maybe

1470
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm thinking he went to. 2018.

1471
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So a mad cap

1472
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
tour. A mad

1473
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
hatted tour by Stephen

1474
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Tyler of Aerosmith alley.

1475
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Daddy where are we?

1476
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
We're at Disney World

1477
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
in France

1478
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and there's a rock and roller coaster but there's

1479
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
this and Liv.

1480
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Liv. Liv. He means Armageddon.

1481
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
This is going to take a minute.

1482
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
He's running over the turnstiles.

1483
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This Armageddon character posters.

1484
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
He's tripping.

1485
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
He's moving

1486
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
fast for a older man.

1487
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's her. It's Liv.

1488
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
His daughter.

1489
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
He makes an I'll get ya face.

1490
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He's like he should have. I mean first of all

1491
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I agree he should have played her father.

1492
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
What a movie that would have been.

1493
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Him glues voice as

1494
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Liv. Liv.

1495
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's your fictional absentee father.

1496
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's your real life absentee father.

1497
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
This park is a

1498
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
simulacra of a

1499
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
movie studio.

1500
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And this video is a simulation of a father

1501
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
taking his daughter to Disney.

1502
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The Disney park.

1503
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
All it took was everyone getting

1504
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
very famous and being able to use this as social

1505
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
media content. Yeah.

1506
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
They got it done. And pictures and

1507
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
footage of themselves in this park

1508
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
also assisted.

1509
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Let's hang out. Just you and me at that park

1510
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
where there's visual depictions of both of us.

1511
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's nice. You would do it with your parent.

1512
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
We'd all do it if we were depicting

1513
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
He you know I'll say this about Stephen Tyler.

1514
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
He loves that they're in theme park

1515
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
stuff like he's like I think he's

1516
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
the only one in the band that's excited

1517
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
about it. I could be wrong. Yeah.

1518
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But like I think Joe Perry turns his nose up

1519
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
a lot at like you know

1520
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
the rock and roll music.

1521
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah. But then the stuff that's not like blues

1522
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I feel like Joe Perry doesn't like jaded

1523
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
the song that we like.

1524
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The most. I feel like he doesn't

1525
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
like all that stuff. He doesn't like pop music

1526
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
as much. He wants to do 12 bar blues with Johnny

1527
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Depp and Alice Cooper in the Hollywood

1528
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
vampires and that's it. I went back

1529
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and listen to the rock and roller coaster episode

1530
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
to see what had come up in this negative.

1531
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Every bit of what you just said. And it's also

1532
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
it's an interesting window in our

1533
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
podcast chronology because

1534
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
there's so much

1535
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
naivete on your part Mike where

1536
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
you bring up Aerosmith and maybe you're

1537
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
expecting a little snark. And in fact we're both

1538
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Jason and I are both like I kind of like

1539
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Aerosmith. Yeah. I kind of like the song

1540
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
jaded. You go oh so

1541
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
you mean it's the finest song

1542
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
ever made and I can bring up the

1543
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
bad boys of Boston in every episode

1544
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
from now on. It's nice to see like

1545
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
the creative spark. That's like the conception

1546
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
of the talk.

1547
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's where the spark

1548
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
was magic. And I was like yes

1549
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
more. Your heart is glowing.

1550
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yeah. Oh my god.

1551
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They seem so down.

1552
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Did we talk about jaded being played at school

1553
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
dances because that's the memory I'm having

1554
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
right now. I don't think so actually. Oh

1555
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
really? I feel like

1556
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
it would have come out.

1557
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Did I in that episode did I talk about the fact

1558
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
that I was going I went to a high school

1559
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
dance with a girl and

1560
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't want to miss a thing came on.

1561
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You did yes. I did say that.

1562
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But she rolled her eyes at it. She was

1563
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
like this is sucks. This song sucks.

1564
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And I was like what?

1565
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
What's wrong with you?

1566
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Your lot in life

1567
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
is you're still experiencing

1568
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
feelings about Aerosmith Carly.

1569
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
No I mean I will say every time

1570
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I go on Rock and Rollercoaster I'm like they do

1571
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
have a robust discography.

1572
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I have a new respect for them every

1573
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
time. Hits in a lot of decades

1574
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
except for the last couple. But

1575
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
a lot more than most bands

1576
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
have. No like preteen memories all

1577
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
tied up in their songs though.

1578
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Okay. Yeah. I wish.

1579
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah. That's okay. That's okay. I'm upset.

1580
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But that's okay.

1581
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It'll deal.

1582
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
During that whirlwind

1583
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
tour of the Armageddon campus

1584
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
you get to see this is the big

1585
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
decoration

1586
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
outside of this building is are the

1587
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
individual character posters because

1588
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Steven takes Liv to go see her

1589
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
character who is of course Grace.

1590
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Of course. Yeah. We know Grace.

1591
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And we pass by a big poster.

1592
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I took this is a picture I took

1593
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
when I was there is the mundanity of a

1594
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
huge poster of Steve Buscemi

1595
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and above it it says his character's name

1596
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Rockhound. Yes.

1597
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Go to Disney

1598
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Ferret. Pay as much as for the Castle

1599
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Park and see a big poster of

1600
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Rockhound. Fantastic.

1601
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That stuff is all good.

1602
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I feel like if the ride wasn't even there

1603
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
it would be better actually.

1604
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Just posters and like the sign of

1605
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Armageddon and then you go that was fun to take

1606
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
pictures with the poster. Yeah.

1607
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Get a picture of me with AJ.

1608
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You know Ben Affleck's lead leading

1609
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
man character AJ.

1610
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Mr. Animal Crackers himself.

1611
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
The most

1612
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
romantic scene.

1613
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Oh yeah. Well and do we talk about the Affleck

1614
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
the commentary track that everybody probably knows about?

1615
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
No I don't know about this. Oh really?

1616
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I think it's on the Armageddon commentary

1617
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and I don't know if Affleck is drunk or not

1618
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
but he's like just talking

1619
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
about Armageddon but just

1620
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
mocking it like crazy.

1621
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
He's just like going back and forth with the dialogue

1622
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense. We're going to train

1623
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
drillers to go into space.

1624
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
We're not going to train astronauts.

1625
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
He's just like and it's much funnier than what I'm

1626
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
doing here but he's relentlessly picking apart

1627
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
the logic of the dialogue

1628
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
in the scenes. It's gone around a few times.

1629
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Because he would have recently have won

1630
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
an Oscar for writing movies.

1631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Sure yeah. Oh yeah.

1632
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah. Yeah he has some clout.

1633
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
You can say that stuff. It is very funny.

1634
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So the outside is spectacular.

1635
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
We all look great.

1636
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah.

1637
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Olivera Smith-Ali is great.

1638
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I was excited as Stephen. But then you get

1639
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
inside and you go into a pretty sure

1640
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
we get very Universal Studios from here.

1641
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
They very much are borrowing a Universal.

1642
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I feel like it's an insult to Universal Studios

1643
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
to say that this is Universal Studios.

1644
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah sure. Because those things are so much better.

1645
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Yeah yeah yeah. Back to Aerith and Twister

1646
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
look like you know they're bringing their A game.

1647
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Compared to this. Yes.

1648
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Two other things that stuck around for

1649
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
a while. But anytime I wrote them

1650
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
the crowd always seemed like oh that was cool.

1651
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Like that was cool to see.

1652
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Stuff fall down. Stuff explode.

1653
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The effects. The music. That sort of thing.

1654
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I understand why I

1655
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
saw this. And this both

1656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
pretty successful movies

1657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
too. Yeah yeah.

1658
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Lessor hits than Armageddon.

1659
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But Twister I think stuck in

1660
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
the popular consciousness for a while.

1661
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah I suppose. Backdraft less so.

1662
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We found that weird that there's a

1663
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
backdraft thing. But a better show.

1664
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Better show. People just. Explosions

1665
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
are kind of pun not

1666
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
intended. Universal.

1667
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Like always popular.

1668
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Which this does have. But you go

1669
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
into this room and it's one of these

1670
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
where here's a guy. What are you?

1671
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
You're from the studio. You

1672
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
represent the director. You're a

1673
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
coordinator. Unclear.

1674
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Unthemed basically.

1675
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Just a room with a bunch of monitors.

1676
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So much French.

1677
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So much French.

1678
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
There's a lot of

1679
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
standard definition

1680
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
footage. There's a lot of 3x4

1681
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
screens. And there's translation

1682
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
like

1683
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
three different. There's two screens

1684
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
with translations on it. And three

1685
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
different languages each.

1686
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I believe on the screen.

1687
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah yeah yeah. Okay.

1688
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So a lot to look at.

1689
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And you watch a video.

1690
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Well it's explained to you

1691
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
that you're going to be in a scene

1692
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
where. I'm sorry.

1693
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You're getting on a Russian

1694
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
space station. And so I

1695
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
guess the scene in the Russian space station

1696
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
is. It's

1697
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
in orbit and a hundred and seventy

1698
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
plane clothes

1699
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
people. Not in astronaut

1700
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
gear. From all places

1701
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
all around the world. They're all

1702
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
just in regular clothes

1703
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
standing around. Not

1704
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
holding anything.

1705
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Right. Well that's what space stations are filled with.

1706
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Generally.

1707
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yeah like one to two hundred

1708
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
random people.

1709
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Who just came in to escape the sun for like twenty minutes.

1710
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1711
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
No space is for. It's for. Commit.

1712
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's for scientists and astronauts and Pete Davidson.

1713
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
That's what space is for.

1714
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So yeah I know it's one of these

1715
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
you're going to be in a scene and remember to be

1716
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
scared. And you're getting your little

1717
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
low down. But then you watch

1718
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
a thing about the history of

1719
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
special effects and their

1720
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
definition of this is like any

1721
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I mean anything that happens. Yeah.

1722
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
A fan is a special effect but

1723
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
also all of Star

1724
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Wars is a special effect. Like it's

1725
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
the full gamut you know.

1726
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah that's right. It seems

1727
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
like an actor acting as a special

1728
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
effect or something like is it's fake.

1729
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Like that's how broad their

1730
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
definition is. Yeah.

1731
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Makeup is a special if it's

1732
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
not there specially.

1733
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So you see a really unfocused

1734
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
montage that's a bunch of

1735
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
everything that qualifies as effects and everything that Disney

1736
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
could like get the rights

1737
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
to at this time

1738
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
which is among the things I spotted

1739
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Rocketeer

1740
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Inspector Gadget.

1741
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Live action and

1742
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Inspector Gadget. Live action Matthew

1743
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Brajk Inspector Gadget. Not the French

1744
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Stewart. Not French Stewart no.

1745
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Darby O'Gill and the little

1746
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
people in there. One of the great

1747
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
special effects films.

1748
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
98 Mighty Joe Young.

1749
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You see

1750
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Eddie Valiant falling and then

1751
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Mickey joins him but then they cut

1752
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
before a certain other character

1753
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
joins him. They don't have the rights to. Right.

1754
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Joins him.

1755
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So you know

1756
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
bunch of which

1757
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Jason you're like dating

1758
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
it and saying it's still around in 2019.

1759
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Who in 2019 is watching this like

1760
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
really. Are they so they use special

1761
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
effects in movies.

1762
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
This is very educational.

1763
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Uh huh.

1764
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
We've talked about Universal eventually

1765
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
has like kind of gotten rid of a lot of that aspect

1766
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
of everything. So

1767
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
2019 I'm trying to was there anything. When did

1768
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Backdraft close? Don't know.

1769
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Not too long ago.

1770
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It closed for Transformers.

1771
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Is that right? Yeah. I think it was before

1772
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I started doing this. Which was 2015.

1773
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm just wondering what the last

1774
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
like version of this I guess Animal Actors

1775
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
are still like behind the scenes.

1776
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Kind of. But by and large. They have

1777
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
special effects state. They have like one

1778
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
uh coordinated off. Yeah.

1779
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
One quarantined. Making of the movies.

1780
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That's like that's the last thing left

1781
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
in this genre of ride.

1782
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah. Yeah they're mostly gone. Are you fun

1783
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
of any of this Scarlett? Like do any of these

1784
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
is there a behind the scenes attraction

1785
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
that strikes you like oh yeah that one's good.

1786
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I mean I think the studio tour is very

1787
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
good and I'm not just saying that because of the company

1788
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
that I'm in. Yeah. But I think

1789
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
you know it every time I'm on it I'm like

1790
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
this is not my thing. Yeah. I like it.

1791
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I still like that. Yeah. And there's enough of though

1792
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I mean those the big things that happen

1793
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
in King Kong. Yeah. And the little

1794
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it's half and half with

1795
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
fun stuff and then a little bit of

1796
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
the subway scene great. Yeah.

1797
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I know it's gonna happen every time

1798
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
but I'm always delighted. Yes. Yeah.

1799
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Absolutely. But you know

1800
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
this? No.

1801
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
What happens is just so. Nothing.

1802
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Nothing happens. Nothing happens.

1803
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Before you get into the room where

1804
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
nothing happens the

1805
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
the this montage

1806
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
ends and it ends with the death star

1807
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
blowing up and then

1808
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and then it cuts to

1809
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
just and then the smoke dissolves the fire

1810
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
dissolves and Michael Clarke Duncan

1811
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
you're greeted by Michael Clarke Duncan who says like

1812
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
woo oh boy

1813
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
ordinarily a massive

1814
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
explosion like that could really hurt a guy.

1815
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You mean the death

1816
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
star? Yeah I'd say so.

1817
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I heard a guy.

1818
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah. He's right. I don't think he knew

1819
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
what was there. We're gonna put in an explosion.

1820
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Okay. Not like the

1821
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
biggest explosion that ever happened.

1822
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The moon sized star base

1823
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
blowing up. We would. Yeah. Oh boy.

1824
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That was close. So

1825
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
anyway Michael Clarke Duncan and this is

1826
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
the biggest thing about how long this thing

1827
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
ran. This attraction

1828
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
ran for seven years

1829
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
after the death of Michael

1830
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Clarke Duncan. Right. There's the only way

1831
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
you and I saw it was well past

1832
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
his demise.

1833
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That's crazy. They just

1834
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
take it out. It doesn't add

1835
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
really anything. I mean

1836
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I guess then you're removing his

1837
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
memory. Yeah. But it's

1838
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
just weird though.

1839
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
There's no acknowledgement

1840
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
of it. I feel like you're right

1841
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
but like with any other this is

1842
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
probably the least paid attention to

1843
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in the Disney company.

1844
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
You know what I mean? Like no one was even

1845
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
paying attention before

1846
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
when he was alive. No one was paying attention after.

1847
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So like if it was a higher

1848
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
profile thing people might have gone oh you know

1849
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
we'll do something in there maybe as a little

1850
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
if we'll leave it as a remembrance.

1851
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
There would be some thought is what I'm

1852
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
saying versus I don't even know

1853
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
if anybody remembered he was on there because

1854
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
this is probably the most forgotten

1855
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
attraction in any

1856
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
park. Yes.

1857
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Quite literally. Probably. I mean it's gotta

1858
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
be in the top three I would think. Yeah.

1859
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I mean I forgot it until you

1860
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
tweeted about it.

1861
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Maybe it shouldn't have been you know. You

1862
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
condemned yourself to reliving it here.

1863
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I mean it's like

1864
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
it really is kind of like unpacking a trauma.

1865
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah.

1866
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
We'll talk about our

1867
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I think both of our spouses said some

1868
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
it was like alright things are a little tense

1869
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
after this thing happens. Jason

1870
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
what are you? Well I was just there was one

1871
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
moment watching someone's

1872
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
camcorder footage of this

1873
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and I just thought it was so odd in this room.

1874
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
There's just a moment where like

1875
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
first off it's showing it starts to

1876
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
show footage of Armageddon and you're

1877
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
like you're gonna be on the space station.

1878
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The asteroid is coming for the space

1879
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
station. That footage

1880
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
again the aspect ratio was kind of

1881
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
driving me a little nuts. I know in

1882
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
a montage it's gonna jump around.

1883
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But later when they're talking about the attraction

1884
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
you are about to go on it was like

1885
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
a letterboxed like a letterboxed

1886
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
scenes from Armageddon

1887
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
and then it cut to full screen

1888
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and it's just a very close

1889
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
up shot of the colonel

1890
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and then

1891
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
That's Stormare possibly? Yes.

1892
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
He's been out in space just a little bit

1893
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
too long is the English translation

1894
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
of what they're saying in this moment.

1895
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And it just seemed like such an odd composition

1896
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
of like alright we got a big

1897
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
shot of this guy's face and then we're

1898
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
translating what's going on.

1899
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And then again stepping back and look at

1900
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
the bigger picture I'm like okay so the characters

1901
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
we've established we have the actor

1902
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Michael Clarke Duncan, the ship's

1903
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
computer of course and then colonel

1904
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Andropov. We all remember

1905
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
colonel Andropov.

1906
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Colonel Andropov.

1907
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
All your favorites are there.

1908
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So

1909
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Michael Clarke Duncan says a bunch

1910
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
of stuff.

1911
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
He says

1912
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
you're gonna come face to face with a rock

1913
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
with a really bad attitude.

1914
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And then he says can I get a little fresh air please

1915
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and then he gets hit with a fan

1916
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and then talks over a fan.

1917
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I should see that one coming. Here on

1918
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
special effects stages you have to be ready for

1919
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
anything. So it's a kooky

1920
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
the set's coming to life.

1921
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I am happy seeing this guy

1922
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
having fun and getting to be himself

1923
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
especially post

1924
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
his day. It reminds you

1925
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
like this guy was good. He was great.

1926
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Don't you put that

1927
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
evil on me Ricky Bobby?

1928
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh that's right. And he's in Talladega Nights.

1929
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Oh yeah that's good. And he has a scene where

1930
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
he stabs him. Brill Ferrell stabs himself.

1931
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah that's a great scene. That's him.

1932
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So you at least get

1933
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
to see him have some fun.

1934
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Then they say they're ready for you on the set and then

1935
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
he's

1936
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
at the end of it the note

1937
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that they leave it on. Cause these kinds of attractions

1938
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
it's always like a little taste of what

1939
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
you might experience in there.

1940
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And in this case he's like well

1941
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
don't worry you're gonna be fine. There's nothing to worry about.

1942
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Right fellas? And then he joins

1943
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
two gargoyles.

1944
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And then he kind of laughs viciously.

1945
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And then it irises in on his face.

1946
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
What do you mean? Am I gonna

1947
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
see gargoyles? Are there gargoyles

1948
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
in the next room? I mean that

1949
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
would have been a plus off.

1950
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I can confirm it is

1951
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Peter Stormare playing Colonel

1952
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Lev Andropov.

1953
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So

1954
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
we leave disappointing room number one

1955
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
and go through a sad hallway

1956
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
into disappointing room number two.

1957
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You almost know already at this point you're like

1958
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
this is the death mark. Also

1959
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
let's track our

1960
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
respective spouses. Yes, yes, yes.

1961
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Cause mine, Erin, has

1962
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
started. I could see her like

1963
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
lose. It's already been a day.

1964
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
You started here. This was the first

1965
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
attraction. The first thing we did in studios.

1966
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I think we did. I went to look up photos

1967
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and it's like it's so long ago they're not even in my

1968
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Google photos. But we started

1969
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Disneyland which I believe my

1970
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
husband thought was quite lackluster.

1971
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And then from there we went to

1972
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
studios and went to this.

1973
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It makes me feel better too. I feel like sometimes I feel like

1974
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
have I been hard on Paris in my crazy

1975
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
in this litmus test. It's weird

1976
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
cause like there's a lot about Disneyland

1977
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Paris that I'll happily make fun of.

1978
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But then again like in

1979
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
this current era it's really

1980
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
kind of becoming its own thing.

1981
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I had the most wonderful time there. Geez

1982
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
that's nice. In 2021 not

1983
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
on the trip that I did this. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1984
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
That was all it was still

1985
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
in the doldrums a little bit. Yeah, Erin's

1986
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
losing it a little bit. Erin's it's this I just remember

1987
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
that this walk between the rooms just like

1988
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
how quickly can this be

1989
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
over. I don't think she, neither of us really know what's

1990
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
coming but I'm like it might be good or at least it might be

1991
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
funny. Then you get into a room

1992
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I mean like you all watch

1993
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
the ride through this or the ride through

1994
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
whatever. Stand through

1995
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
stand up. You're

1996
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
in a very tight

1997
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I mean this is this would be a COVID nightmare. It's

1998
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
great that it closed before. It's

1999
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
just like Star Cruiser. Oh yeah, yeah.

2000
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Oh right.

2001
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah, Mastodon there now I

2002
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
hear. Yep. Oh from

2003
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the jump. Oh already

2004
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
it wasn't icy. Disney should have done

2005
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
an immersive Armageddon

2006
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
hotel. Do not give them that idea.

2007
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
We've done it for like 10 minutes and it

2008
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
was horrible.

2009
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, we don't need to spend more

2010
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
but what if you could meet Rockhound?

2011
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Well, probably not Rockhound like a guy

2012
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
that knows Rockhound.

2013
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Well Rockhound I think is I haven't

2014
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
watched this film but apparently the character

2015
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Rockhound says some very cancelable

2016
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
things. Oh really? I think Rockhound

2017
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
is a scumbag. If I recall he's

2018
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
very horny.

2019
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That's his kind of gimmick. So he's like

2020
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Pat O'Brien?

2021
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Maybe less.

2022
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
He might be more horny.

2023
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Okay, well

2024
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
we'll analyze this

2025
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
later. One of my first exposures

2026
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
to see

2027
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Buscemi

2028
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
in this kind of

2029
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
you know flat movie

2030
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
otherwise. They stacked it up.

2031
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's good actors. It's got great actors.

2032
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It does have a good cast.

2033
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm not getting to do a lot of good

2034
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
stuff. So

2035
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
it's Russian Space Station.

2036
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Even though you're walking into it

2037
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and it's an immersive environment when you walk in

2038
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
the screens are not they don't show

2039
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
space yet. They all are placeholder and they

2040
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
say like Earth

2041
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
feed meteor feed.

2042
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So that's taking you out of it right away.

2043
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You're on a set and that's not like

2044
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
it's

2045
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
just such a bummer immediately.

2046
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And then they're calling out like

2047
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
lighting changes. Let's

2048
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
start shooting. So there's too much of that

2049
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
set. Right. Overlay.

2050
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Fake theme park. We're shooting a movie

2051
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
nonsense. Yes. We're shooting

2052
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
a movie that came out decades ago.

2053
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Yeah. The opening of Hollywood Studios

2054
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
style or I guess Universal

2055
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Studios like of just like yeah this

2056
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
doesn't make any sense. I don't know why.

2057
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah. Unless it's that

2058
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
superstar television where they're

2059
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
like shooting new things with people on

2060
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
that's what we call it. Right. Yeah. That makes sense.

2061
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
We're going to shoot scenes from famous things

2062
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
with actual people. Yeah. That's like

2063
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
the only context where it doesn't

2064
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
people shouldn't be confused or like

2065
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
what. It's so insane because

2066
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
like if all right we want to take you

2067
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
behind the scenes and show you how things are made.

2068
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
This is not how things are made.

2069
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Sets aren't immersive and

2070
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
360 degrees and they don't all happen

2071
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
in the course of five minutes and

2072
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
with like with the real

2073
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
effects coming close to hurting

2074
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
you. So like you know

2075
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
it's already your it's already

2076
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
fantastical what you're showing.

2077
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You know what else is fantastical is

2078
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
theme park. Rise of the Resistance is

2079
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
fantastic. Why not just commit all

2080
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
if Rise of the Resistance constantly had we're ready for

2081
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
you on the first order set

2082
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
to destroy

2083
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
the entire thing. If

2084
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I can add something that also kind of

2085
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
took me out of it because I watched two ride throughs

2086
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
of this and by the first

2087
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
the first minute of the second ride

2088
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
through it was like God why did I find

2089
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
another video.

2090
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
But I was interested in that

2091
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
the one there was a cast member and their

2092
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
outfit was like a gray

2093
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
jumpsuit with like a yellow reflector

2094
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
vest. But the first video I watched

2095
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
it was just someone in like

2096
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
theater blacks like a black

2097
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
sweatshirt and black pants.

2098
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But two different shades of black

2099
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
like they truly looked like they were a standup

2100
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
comic about to complain about

2101
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
how you can't say anything anymore.

2102
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Like that kind of black. And that

2103
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
just threw me because I'm like I find

2104
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
it hard if you're going to wear all black to

2105
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
sometimes find the right matching shades

2106
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
but I'm like wait Disney bought this

2107
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
outfit why didn't they buy an outfit

2108
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
with the same top and bottom.

2109
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Unless they didn't.

2110
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Because she didn't have a reflective

2111
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
vest on. So I was like wait did you

2112
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
just walk in?

2113
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Did you just walk in? It's like oh we got to

2114
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
start running this thing I'm just going to hop up.

2115
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
They don't check uniforms anymore.

2116
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Was it a turtleneck?

2117
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
It was just like a crew neck.

2118
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It wasn't like a

2119
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
you know. Because I picture like

2120
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
a French person. Oh no it wasn't that kind of turtleneck.

2121
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
A beatnik.

2122
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm picturing a French beatnik from the 1960s.

2123
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I mean that would really jazz it up.

2124
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Anything.

2125
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
It's so funny to me because like there's so many

2126
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
attractions that are like here's how movies are made.

2127
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But I truly don't know how an Avengers

2128
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
movie is made. I like I know there's a lot of blue

2129
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
or green maybe. And then they

2130
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
like stand on a box and somehow it looks

2131
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
like they're flying above New York City. I don't get it.

2132
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I would love to know. I would love to know.

2133
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
You're right. New things. I don't know how things are made

2134
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
anymore. Like now if they updated

2135
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
any of this it would be interesting. Like teach me how

2136
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
you put all those people together in a scene.

2137
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Are they all there or not? Are they in Atlanta?

2138
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
What's going on?

2139
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You would be like you would be I think is you would

2140
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
drive into like a room with

2141
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
like 400 people at computers

2142
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
being like these are the people who make the movie.

2143
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You see it in the credits.

2144
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
These many people like animating

2145
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
the Black Widow's like wrist gauntlet

2146
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
firing mechanism or something.

2147
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And then like they're just like tired

2148
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and upset and

2149
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
not being paid enough. And those are the

2150
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
people that make the movie. Filmmakers use a term

2151
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
called crunch.

2152
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
He's working 16 to 18 hour days.

2153
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Certain effects.

2154
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
There's more effects houses that like do

2155
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
the big stuff and then there's like they farm out

2156
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
certain effects to like different

2157
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
sometimes in Marvel movies you can see like certain

2158
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
CGI scenes are like look really good and then some

2159
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
scenes look like absolute garbage.

2160
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's probably because like they were late and they were like I just farm

2161
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
this out to a smaller company.

2162
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Yeah really get it done. Whatever. We don't care.

2163
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Just put a filter on the front

2164
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
of it and make it look like it's dark out doesn't matter.

2165
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Yeah. I mean the one of the last

2166
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
big effect stories the last 10 years

2167
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
was that the company

2168
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
that did the effects

2169
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and then won a bunch of Oscars for a life of

2170
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
pie had gone bankrupt

2171
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
in between releasing the movie

2172
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and winning the Oscars for

2173
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
a life of pie.

2174
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Not an industry you're dying to. You know what they

2175
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
genuinely could do. We talked about this before.

2176
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
They could do like

2177
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
that the Mandalorian

2178
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
practical the screens that look

2179
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
really good if they did something with those.

2180
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Oh yeah that'd be great. Because I would like to see

2181
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
those in person and then it's like your kid

2182
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
is in a scene that

2183
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
shot instantaneously and you watch

2184
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
and it looks like Mandalorian. That would

2185
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
not be the worst. They should be

2186
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
adding things of this nature. That's

2187
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
something you could do in an environment like this

2188
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
that would work and be cool. Yeah it's like we always

2189
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
say more screens.

2190
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
We love screens. Of course we love

2191
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
screens.

2192
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
But a forward looking like a forward looking

2193
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
thing that kind of tricked like I was

2194
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
tricked for the first few episodes. Like I didn't

2195
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
realize they were doing that until they had like a featurette

2196
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
on it.

2197
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So yeah put and then sell the tape of you

2198
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
in the

2199
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Mandalorian with Fennec Shand and

2200
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
that's the name of the character.

2201
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I mean they literally have empty

2202
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
sound stages. There is no excuse.

2203
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yeah sure.

2204
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah it's better than literally nothing.

2205
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yes.

2206
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
This is one of those where like we could

2207
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
say some things bit by bit

2208
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that happen in this

2209
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
final part. But like what happened? Really?

2210
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Like can you even name

2211
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
like let's name a moment of this

2212
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
space station scene.

2213
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I think it's like something hits something

2214
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and then

2215
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
there's like does it jiggle then or does

2216
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
it jiggle later? There's a jiggle.

2217
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
But I don't recall where.

2218
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And then there's way more

2219
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
pyro than I remembered.

2220
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah there's a lot of flames

2221
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
in the room and here's another

2222
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
thing I'm going to say that I don't particularly care

2223
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
for is flames in

2224
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
the room. I will

2225
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
allow it in a set

2226
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
like I acknowledge that it's cool

2227
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
in the mummy coaster

2228
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
in Florida. That's cool

2229
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
enough that effect on the ceiling that I will

2230
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
deal with that it's a little freaky.

2231
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
But like I don't know if this is like a

2232
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
scary cat thing. It's like

2233
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
haunts or launches. I think I'm okay

2234
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I just I don't want flames in the room

2235
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
with me. It's never it's not cool

2236
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
enough for me to not because

2237
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I think some of it is you start smelling that

2238
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
gas a little even before it happens

2239
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
and you think like oh flames coming

2240
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and I just don't it's I'm unnerved by the

2241
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
like gas isn't a

2242
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
fun thing to smell in a thing on

2243
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
my vacation. Well it's so

2244
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
close it is like mall

2245
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
fountain level like

2246
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
proximity. Like you get really

2247
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
close to this little giant fireball

2248
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
at the end. Yeah, yeah.

2249
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I don't know how do we feel about flames? Am I

2250
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I guess I'm pro flame in a close

2251
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
space I think. Yeah.

2252
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Yeah you're pro.

2253
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Okay Jason you're anti?

2254
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Well I want I want a little

2255
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
distance. So what is a ride

2256
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
comfortably? I think backdraft

2257
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
that I'm comfortable with. This

2258
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
like put putting

2259
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
your little hands

2260
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
under your head. Your little hands?

2261
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Next to like on the railing

2262
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and leaning over the railing

2263
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
with your like head in your hands and a fireball

2264
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
and six feet in front of you. That's

2265
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
too much. You're like a teen girl on the bed

2266
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
like this.

2267
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
This is like the sensual part of this

2268
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
attraction. Thinking about

2269
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
yeah. That's interesting.

2270
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I don't know. I shoot a flame

2271
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
at me. I don't like I'll make

2272
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
wince I might get scared but at least I'm feeling

2273
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
some I'm least I'm alive.

2274
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Outside I was fine with it. Like some of my

2275
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
family I feel like we went on

2276
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
the Jaws ride once at Universal

2277
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and they were like these flames out there way

2278
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
too hot way too close to the boat. I'm like

2279
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
bring it on. We gotta we gotta get

2280
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
that shark. Outside

2281
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
your pro flame. Yeah yeah.

2282
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Indiana Jones stunt show love those

2283
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
flames. I've sat close at wrestling events

2284
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and they shoot a lot of pyro which is

2285
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
loud as hell. See that would scare me. That's a temporary

2286
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
setup. That's not a safe.

2287
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
This is a permanent flame. They're

2288
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
blasting them out all day. I'm not concerned.

2289
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah well I guess

2290
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
that's true. It's probably at this point

2291
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
they've run it so many times and like

2292
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
for Monday Night Raw that's

2293
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
new that's fresh. They're on the road right?

2294
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
In the morning yeah. That's like a carnival.

2295
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
That can't be trusted. Last year

2296
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I think the WrestleMania sign caught on fire

2297
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I think. This is what I'm talking about.

2298
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm pretty sure. Michael I just want to

2299
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
correct you. Multiple WrestleMania

2300
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
signs.

2301
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Oh god. Yeah.

2302
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So. And that's the billion

2303
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
dollar earning promotion.

2304
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Sure yeah. Catching stuff on fire.

2305
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I like that logic. This is interesting.

2306
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So there's a whole spectrum here. There's no flame.

2307
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
There's outdoor flame. Not indoor

2308
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
flame. There's total pro flame.

2309
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And then there's pro

2310
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
not temporary. Permaflame.

2311
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Permaflame. Yes. Permaflame.

2312
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Should we do the flame final four?

2313
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
The theme park flame final

2314
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
four? The best flame

2315
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
scene. That's actually not a bad idea

2316
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
maybe. I figured it out.

2317
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But yeah exactly. It's all a mush.

2318
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
As it's happened. And it's all around

2319
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
you which is interesting. But you also don't know where

2320
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
to look. I think in not a good way.

2321
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Were you close to this?

2322
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Because it's circular. It's like you're on

2323
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
a donut. Because the center is where they have

2324
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
the fire stuff. So were you closer

2325
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
to the center or were you more towards the back?

2326
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I think maybe closer to the back.

2327
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Maybe something unpleasant happened behind me

2328
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
and I didn't know where to look at. Maybe I

2329
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
just felt some heats. Were you putting

2330
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
your head in your little hands? Yeah.

2331
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
When I was happening.

2332
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I hope this is the best show I've ever seen.

2333
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Bonjour asteroid.

2334
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Where were you?

2335
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I was towards the back and I remember

2336
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
being like oh I wish I would have known what this

2337
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
was because I would have wanted to be right by the

2338
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
flame. Oh okay.

2339
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
The center piece. The only thing to look at.

2340
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yeah because it does culminate

2341
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
in then lights are out and the

2342
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
plot wise what is this?

2343
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
The space station if we haven't said

2344
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
is getting attacked. But multiple

2345
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Yeah a bunch of asteroids are tearing through

2346
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the space station.

2347
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
There's two really big things

2348
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
that rubbed me the wrong way about this ride.

2349
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
One it is based on a cut away

2350
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
shot from the movie Armageddon.

2351
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Interesting in the realm of podcasting.

2352
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I think very interesting.

2353
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And two

2354
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
wait this ride is about you

2355
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
just accepting inevitable

2356
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
death. Like impending death

2357
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
is coming to you. Which is a very

2358
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I mean that's very French film.

2359
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But it's a little weird that it's in a Disney park

2360
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
where it's just like oh you're all

2361
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
going to die. But only in a

2362
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
scene. But in one scene.

2363
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
But also Michael Clarke Duncan just told

2364
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
you nothing bad is going to happen to you.

2365
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And he's dead so.

2366
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
That's something bad happened to him.

2367
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Yeah. Yeah it's a

2368
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
boy it is already in a

2369
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
grim park on a grim property

2370
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
in the grimest part of it.

2371
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Well maybe if you view it as

2372
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
that as a reflection on death.

2373
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Maybe that's a good angle on it.

2374
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
If you're not trying to view it as an exciting

2375
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
e-ticket. I mean I guess I'm getting ahead of myself to

2376
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
what we would have done to plus it up. But even if they had

2377
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
had Bruce Willis's Harry

2378
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Stamper character like in the movie when

2379
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Liv Tyler is like at the

2380
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
screen before he dies because he sacrifices

2381
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
himself to save the earth.

2382
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Even something like that would have maybe put a bow

2383
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
on it that were like I don't know

2384
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
that were like well

2385
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I guess that's not exactly that we're

2386
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
burning Bruce Willis I guess in this case.

2387
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So maybe I'm wrong. Maybe my

2388
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
thought process is bad here.

2389
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I maybe your only

2390
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
thought process that's bad is the idea that this could be

2391
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
a good thing.

2392
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Were you satisfied then by

2393
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
the because that's what I was getting at was

2394
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
it's being destroyed by

2395
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
so then what you feel at the end is like

2396
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
that's the

2397
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
final curtain kind of like

2398
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
and now the flames that kill you

2399
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
are bursting through the center

2400
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
of your donut. Oh I legitimately had

2401
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
no idea what was going on from start to

2402
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
finish when I went on this.

2403
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
We should be Bruce Willis. Here's the

2404
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
right thing. Liv should be on

2405
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
a screen mourning us.

2406
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Like all my good friends

2407
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
are all my siblings or something.

2408
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
She remembers

2409
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
the happy ending. I like that.

2410
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I like that. So you see her.

2411
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
We have to have pushed

2412
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Affleck in because remember

2413
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
the movie he was going to stay behind.

2414
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Right. And and then Bruce Willis

2415
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
like take care of my daughter.

2416
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yeah right.

2417
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So it should be something like that

2418
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
that we've we all collectively

2419
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
throw Ben Affleck out a

2420
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
hatch of some kind

2421
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and then the flame and Liv

2422
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
mourns us then the flame comes through blows

2423
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
us all up and then we're all heroes.

2424
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
We have lived

2425
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
a hero experience. So we're

2426
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
dead. We are dead. We're dead. Like Mr.

2427
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Toe. There are attractions where you

2428
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
die. Right. So make this

2429
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
another one of those. Make it another one of those.

2430
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And the one ride through I

2431
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
watched the big fire

2432
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
like at the end I was

2433
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
like ooh that must have been really big

2434
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
because the screen just went white.

2435
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
They were focused on that center

2436
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
jet and I was just like

2437
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
oh my god everything went white. Now it's going to be back

2438
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
into focus. I was like well at least there's a big

2439
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
ending I guess.

2440
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
With me not liking flames I

2441
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
just didn't like that happening at all.

2442
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Were you as a permaflame

2443
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
fan did you at least like the ending

2444
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
after all the struggle of the

2445
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
experience? I don't know if I

2446
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
have any recall of the

2447
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
ending because I was trying to not

2448
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
be actively divorced at that

2449
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
moment. Cause I just

2450
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
was standing next to my husband going

2451
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I forced him to come here. I

2452
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
forced him to come to this park and he said

2453
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
doesn't everyone say Disneyland Paris sucks?

2454
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And I said no

2455
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and let's go to both of them.

2456
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
So I was really just trying

2457
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
to get out of the grave I had dug myself.

2458
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So yeah what happens

2459
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
right after?

2460
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
This all is happening you're not

2461
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
in the narrative of it. You are thinking how do

2462
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I need to save this day?

2463
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
We realized at some

2464
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
point in the donut room in the secondary

2465
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
the worst room I would say perhaps.

2466
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
They're both bad. Unpleasant. It's also

2467
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
very loud. It's just like here's a room with loud

2468
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
sounds. That's the bulk of what this is.

2469
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I mean we started

2470
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
to realize this was the ride.

2471
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
This wasn't the pre-show

2472
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
for the attraction that we thought we were going

2473
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
to. This was the attraction.

2474
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And that realization was

2475
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
there's no amount of indoor fire

2476
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
that could make that

2477
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
better. So are you

2478
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
apologetic?

2479
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Defensive? It's not my fault?

2480
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I mean I still can't really

2481
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
live it down. It's

2482
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
like Disneyland Paris will forever have a stink on it

2483
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
because of this.

2484
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
We have very similar experiences

2485
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
here because this was

2486
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
at the very end of

2487
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
my honeymoon by the way.

2488
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
This is the big mistake

2489
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
we made is that like incredible

2490
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
trip to Paris and

2491
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Rome and Florence and then we thought

2492
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
well we end it back in Paris

2493
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
so it can be a round trip.

2494
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And we love Disney so it culminates in Disney

2495
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
but it puts so much pressure

2496
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
on it. I've said all this before. Florence

2497
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
is probably the best place I've ever been. Maybe until

2498
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Tokyo but they're neck and neck.

2499
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
So we were coming from this euphoric experience

2500
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
in this beautiful city with the best food

2501
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
ever and now we're in the Armageddon

2502
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
special show.

2503
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And this was really

2504
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
we even like we managed to have

2505
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
some loopy fun in the

2506
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
in our first day which was in the

2507
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Magic Kingdom Park. But still

2508
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
it was like a struggle. We had to like really press

2509
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
through and like it's like

2510
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
we're so insane that it's fun. It's not

2511
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
the relaxation that Honeymoon

2512
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
could and should be. So now we're here

2513
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
we even were at the gate going do we pay

2514
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
for this dumb place? And it's

2515
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
like well I don't know right behind

2516
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
this gate is a new Disney theme

2517
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
park that will probably never be near again.

2518
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Maybe we need to do this.

2519
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Maybe it'll be content someday

2520
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for something.

2521
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And we go in and it would buy Armageddon we were thinking

2522
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
maybe this was a bad it. Maybe we could have just like

2523
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I don't know gone into the city again.

2524
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Just waved at the Eiffel Tower. Almost anything

2525
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
else. Actually Erin in reliving it

2526
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
said I would say

2527
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
it's waiting for the dentist

2528
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
is more pleasant than this.

2529
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Maybe not the dentist itself if you're getting drilled.

2530
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's at least in English.

2531
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or at least translated well.

2532
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
You can understand what's happening to you. There can be a

2533
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
calm in a waiting room. I think we were

2534
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
just talking about Jason you proposed that flying

2535
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
can be like okay. You felt like a flight

2536
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
can be fine. I yeah

2537
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
like if you want to disconnect

2538
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
like and just read a book or like

2539
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
work on writing and stuff. I just

2540
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
listened to this episode and I fully agree with you.

2541
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Thank you. Yeah. Or train travel

2542
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
very much the same. I was trains I feel like

2543
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
they give away the Wi-Fi on Amtrak.

2544
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But it's also

2545
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
it's very bad.

2546
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Wi-Fi is free.

2547
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's still like very expensive

2548
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
for 30 minutes a Wi-Fi. I'm like American

2549
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Airlines. Like it's just not worth it.

2550
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Why is that still so? That doesn't make any sense.

2551
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
But this is where I was thinking about this.

2552
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I would rather sit on a plane almost. Even a plane

2553
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
with mild turbulence than go on this Armageddon thing.

2554
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It would be the same amount of turbulence

2555
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
as that ride. Yeah. Yeah. Which still is

2556
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
not that. Yeah. I've been there's been

2557
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
more exciting turbulence on a real plane

2558
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
because there's it's a real disaster.

2559
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Well that's a big drop.

2560
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
That's something. So

2561
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
anyways we get out of it. Just this

2562
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
was the kind of the pit of the day I felt

2563
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
like. And Aaron's

2564
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
just staring daggers. And once we once we

2565
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
slowly file out of the room I think she turns to me

2566
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
and says what about rides? Are there

2567
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
rides in this park? Is there a ride anywhere

2568
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
in this park? I think we had

2569
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
not been on on a ride yet.

2570
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And I said rock and roller

2571
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
coasters that way. I'm not going to do it. I don't do

2572
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
launches. You can go do it.

2573
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And I went and watched this dumb Martin

2574
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Short show where he goes through the history

2575
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
of movies. Oh my god. Like that's I can

2576
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
handle the kitch. Aaron's like I need to

2577
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
do a thing that someone might

2578
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
enjoy without levels.

2579
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And so we took some time

2580
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
apart. We split up for a second.

2581
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It literally made us split up. It split us up

2582
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
on the last day of our honeymoon.

2583
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It's important to have your own

2584
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
interests. Yeah.

2585
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
She's interested in

2586
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
not ruining her own life.

2587
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Whereas I.

2588
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So we took a little time and then we

2589
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
reconvened. And I said oh how was that rock and

2590
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
roller coaster? And she said it was fine.

2591
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Do you want to get to the airport

2592
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
early?

2593
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Pretty much how this went.

2594
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Did you watch I forget what it's called there

2595
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
but in Florida it's called Lights Motor Action.

2596
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
We didn't do that because by that point it was just

2597
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
like what is the we need to bail on

2598
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
this as quickly as let's go eat a crappy

2599
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
burger in the Radisson

2600
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
lobby. And then like

2601
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
we cannot handle another like

2602
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
sitting through a thing. I like I don't think

2603
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
we haven't done Lights Motor Action.

2604
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I am a Lights Motor Action defender.

2605
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
That was actually. I never saw it anywhere.

2606
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Stunt driving and like cool

2607
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
car tricks. That had some cool behind the

2608
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
scenes stuff. Yeah.

2609
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And then and then after a few years

2610
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Light McQueen drove in and

2611
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
just did a lap and then left.

2612
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Hey.

2613
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I just feel so bad that you guys haven't

2614
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
you know half of us haven't tested our

2615
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
relationships inside this attraction.

2616
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It's the ultimate test.

2617
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
You'll never know if it's true love.

2618
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The ultimate stress test.

2619
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But also they never will in a way

2620
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
because this it's so funny we have this exact

2621
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
say it's like tense in general

2622
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
and then this is like

2623
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and you're on vacation because the possibilities

2624
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
of what a vacation could be.

2625
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
You chose that and you're

2626
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
you and I were responsible for

2627
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
our spouse pain.

2628
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I mean I'm still dealing

2629
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
with it because we went back in November

2630
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and I had just gone with my mom

2631
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
for multiple days so I had like really packed

2632
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
in Disneyland Paris had a great time.

2633
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I made my husband go back for one day. I was like

2634
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
we're in Paris for a week. I have to do it.

2635
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I'm there. I have to go. And I'm just now

2636
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
remembering that I think he refused

2637
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
to go on any ride. I don't think

2638
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
we went on a single ride. He's like I will

2639
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
walk in a circle around the park with you

2640
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
and we brought our own sandwiches. He did not

2641
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
eat. He did not ride. He was

2642
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
just like this is my limit after

2643
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
what happened. Well that seems like

2644
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
a fair compromise.

2645
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm sure conversely

2646
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
he struck you to like work functions

2647
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
or like dinner at the boss's

2648
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
house or something. And you know

2649
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
you gotta give and take.

2650
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
When you're using your Jason argument of it's work.

2651
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I'm here for work. I'm doing work. I'm stressed

2652
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I'm at work. Yeah. So if

2653
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
you put that on it. Yeah.

2654
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I guess that's a way. Yeah. So just

2655
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
remind. Listen. I don't think I hate anything

2656
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
as much as he hates Disneyland Paris.

2657
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Next time you're going to dinner at the boss's

2658
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
house.

2659
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So you know this is just the same

2660
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
as the Armageddon ride. Exactly the same as having

2661
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
to watch this Russian

2662
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
cosmonaut translated

2663
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
into multiple languages.

2664
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
The terrific Peter Storber.

2665
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You get to see

2666
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
45 seconds of it. You hear a voice that may

2667
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
or may not be him. It could be a sound. It very

2668
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
easily could be a sound like and there is

2669
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
a computer voice. Cause he is

2670
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
he is playing a Russian character

2671
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
speaking English. But the computer

2672
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
voice is doing kind of generic

2673
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
computer voice but speaking French.

2674
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So it's a real melting pot.

2675
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
You know. It's got that going.

2676
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Yeah. And then you have to hear him say like

2677
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
what is generator status.

2678
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It is pretty

2679
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Boris Baranov.

2680
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Sparkling dialogue. Great accent.

2681
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
This is fascinating.

2682
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I'm actually now curious with what we have

2683
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
experienced if any listeners

2684
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
have run into this and where you

2685
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
may be pushed a partner

2686
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
to the brink. Who where I feel

2687
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
like you know

2688
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
if you're ending up in these parks even if the

2689
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
person's not as big of a fan as

2690
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
you and Aaron's a major Disney parks fan

2691
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
but she's got the limit.

2692
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And I'm curious of any stories of like where

2693
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
did the limit set in.

2694
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I'd be curious for any

2695
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
or else everybody's just like it's never happened.

2696
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Maybe find somebody who has no

2697
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
limit. There was I'm trying to think but

2698
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I think I've said this on the show before. I think there was like

2699
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
two Disney World trips ago. Lindsay was like

2700
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I think it was like day three or four.

2701
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And she was like I gotta

2702
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
sleep in. I'm tapping out

2703
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
and I go well you can meet me

2704
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
in Animal Kingdom. She's like fine.

2705
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So I'm like

2706
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
on the bus to Animal Kingdom

2707
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
alone at like 9 a.m.

2708
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I didn't know this one.

2709
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
But also as Jason was saying

2710
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
you have separate you know you have different

2711
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
speeds of vacation. Yeah.

2712
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Yes.

2713
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
When we were there in the fall I talked about

2714
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Jane tapped out on the Friday of

2715
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
like a week long trip and she's like I'm

2716
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
gonna the pool and I'm gonna take a bath.

2717
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And I was just standing on concrete

2718
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
in Hollywood Studios reading

2719
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
like a blog that's like crowds

2720
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
not seen since the July peak

2721
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
on Veterans Day week. And I'm just like oh

2722
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
my god.

2723
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Having to like

2724
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
defend yourself as the one who made the

2725
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
right choice in situations like

2726
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
that. No I mean not

2727
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
mean then not going on

2728
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
the roller coaster that goes fast.

2729
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
But I got to experience

2730
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Martin Short as a man with a

2731
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
flip phone who gets

2732
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
sucked into the history of

2733
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
some of five movies that Disney

2734
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
could afford. It was hard for me to say

2735
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I made the right choice in that situation.

2736
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
But there maybe there I think

2737
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
at this time there was not a right choice

2738
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
to be made at Disney Studios Paris.

2739
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Oh after you do Armageddon everything's a write off.

2740
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
It's just over. Your day's

2741
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
done. Let's just

2742
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
round up to the end I guess. Yeah. Cause in

2743
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Orlando if you tap if you need to like

2744
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
all right let's get the parks today

2745
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
and stuff. Disney Springs has

2746
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
so much to offer. The Disney

2747
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Village does not seem like it has that

2748
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
appeal. Oh my God.

2749
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Recently I'm he probably

2750
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
doesn't mind if I say this friend of

2751
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
the show Mac Cardona also has been to Disneyland

2752
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Paris recently and I think has sent me

2753
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
some photos of the village.

2754
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It seemed to me like he was

2755
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
amped on it just that he was but maybe that

2756
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
was I was not amped about Disney Village.

2757
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I don't know that he had anything in depth to say.

2758
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I mean it's got a pretty well preserved

2759
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
planet Hollywood. He did send us

2760
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
pictures from that. We were saying it's the only

2761
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
trash planet Hollywood left. A good time capsule.

2762
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Crazy looking one. Cause you know now that we're all

2763
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
like there's these communal spaces

2764
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
online for people who like the old stuff

2765
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
to like reminisce about it and

2766
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
that is one of the old places that still stands.

2767
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Right yes. But it is definitely

2768
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
not as fun as we

2769
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
will think it was in ten years from now.

2770
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
This is true and you hate

2771
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
to say it there's certain things where like look

2772
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
if it's gonna be better to do something

2773
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
new we all have the memories

2774
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
increasingly we have like VR

2775
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
walk throughs and exhaustive

2776
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
videos. I can see the logic

2777
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
in certain things changing

2778
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
ever. Such as this.

2779
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Such as even if there is one

2780
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
strange person out there who like but Armageddon

2781
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
was so crazy.

2782
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I do think that the replacement

2783
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
web slingers the new Spider

2784
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Man ride is going to

2785
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
appeal to someone. I think

2786
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
probably. More than this

2787
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
trash. I am very nervous that

2788
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
they're redoing the Boardwalk Hotel

2789
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
in Orlando. They already got rid of

2790
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
the clown slide it's all downhill.

2791
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I guess that's true. That's my outlook.

2792
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I mean we must protect

2793
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
the nanny chairs. We are on nanny chair

2794
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
watch 24 7 now.

2795
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
There are the nanny chairs.

2796
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I don't see if anyone notices working

2797
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
the graveyard shift.

2798
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I am very concerned that they're going to

2799
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
get rid of them. But I also

2800
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I was talking to someone a friend

2801
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
of mine and he thinks that the coffee

2802
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
bar that's being added is going where the

2803
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Bellevue Lounge is which was secretly

2804
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
my favorite bar that I never told people about

2805
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
because it used to not be busy and after the pandemic

2806
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
or during the pandemic it became busy.

2807
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
But it was great. There's a wicker couch

2808
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
that has cup holders built into the wicker.

2809
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
This is a library kind of

2810
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
study. It's like that little the little annex bar

2811
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
to the right of the Boardwalk lobby.

2812
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
What's it called again? Yeah they were yeah they're

2813
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Bellevue Inn I believe. I went

2814
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
there last time I was down.

2815
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Bellevue Lounge? Jane they're playing old timey radio.

2816
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
They're playing old timey radio.

2817
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And she's like it's 10

2818
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
AM we've been up for five hours.

2819
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I don't care.

2820
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
This is supposed to red eye.

2821
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
This is when we were kind of land and kill time.

2822
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
We land and kill time when we're trapped by

2823
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
the marathon. We could not get

2824
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
anywhere. Oh that marathon story.

2825
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
We got trapped by the marathon. Never have we had more

2826
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
sympathy for you. Our reservations

2827
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
were to Epcot so we couldn't go

2828
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
anywhere. You couldn't get into Epcot when it wasn't

2829
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
open was the story. We couldn't

2830
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
get into Epcot. We were baffled

2831
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
by that story because it involved like and then there was a

2832
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
cone there.

2833
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Well there were so many cones and there was

2834
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
runners and people were like no no you can't come

2835
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
through. But it wasn't open.

2836
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But

2837
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
nothing was open.

2838
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Besides like one breakfast

2839
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
stand. Would it have

2840
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
been on a non marathon day?

2841
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Well even the footpaths to like

2842
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Swan and Dolphin. But the footpaths

2843
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
would have been open. Yeah

2844
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
you could have gone a little more. So the issue

2845
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
is that at 10am the footpaths weren't open.

2846
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That's a big deal. You're trapped.

2847
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
We're trapped. You're trapped at the boardwalk. Your options

2848
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
are very limited.

2849
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
The boardwalk was like half of everything

2850
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
is closed. They half opened.

2851
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And they half opened like the walkways

2852
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
around the lake

2853
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
resorts. And so

2854
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
like we're able to walk to the boardwalk.

2855
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
But then the bus services

2856
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
were only running to the open

2857
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
parks that due to park reservation

2858
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
systems we couldn't go anywhere.

2859
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Are you getting more of a sense of why this was

2860
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Jason's Armageddon?

2861
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And I thought oh okay

2862
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
we can go to Disney Springs.

2863
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
No. Disney Springs didn't open

2864
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
until 10am. And this was earlier.

2865
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So like. I'm trying.

2866
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I will admit I got distracted

2867
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
because on the disboards.com

2868
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
somebody wrote what is the Bellevue

2869
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
room at boardwalk. And then somebody

2870
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
just wrote under it the boardwalk bakery no

2871
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
longer toasts bagel. Just sold

2872
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
as is.

2873
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
No.

2874
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
It's worse than a Russian space station blowing up.

2875
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I think that's what it's called though. Like the lobby bar essentially.

2876
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Bellevue lounge is what it's called. Yeah.

2877
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
But I just got distracted by the

2878
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
this course. That's sort of like if I was at a media

2879
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
event I'd tell the people that I'm friends

2880
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
with that we're meeting up at Bellevue.

2881
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And then we'd all go there after.

2882
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
If you let the cat out of the bag is now

2883
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Bellevue gonna get swamped? Well I think it's gonna become this

2884
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
coffee shop. Cause they just announced a whole redo.

2885
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Oh. So Bellevue is

2886
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
already the dream's over. Also I tried to go there

2887
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
maybe during the 50th at some point and there was a line

2888
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
to order cocktails. And I was like

2889
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
no no no no no.

2890
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I feel like when the other day

2891
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
when I walked by the Hurston lounge at the Grand

2892
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
California. It's a similar thing. There's like a little

2893
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
coffee set up outside of it now.

2894
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
The bar was roped off early.

2895
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
There was a bunch of partitions and I'm like

2896
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
oh okay this is kinda

2897
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
no mans land. You gotta find your secret spots.

2898
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Yeah. They're disappearing.

2899
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Is the air bar still good?

2900
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I mean I've kind of avoided most tight

2901
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
indoor places just cause the times I've visited

2902
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
have been during like peak pandemic

2903
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
times. But I haven't

2904
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
been there in a while. I don't I feel

2905
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
too old for a drink with cotton candy in it.

2906
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Do they have that?

2907
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
This is an insane statement you've just made in front of Mike Carson.

2908
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Again you've made me upset but

2909
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
no no

2910
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I didn't even know there was cotton candy.

2911
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah they have don't they have one that's cotton candy and then they pour

2912
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
the drink in and then it dissolves and they're like

2913
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
magic. That's interesting cause

2914
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I've only ever gotten like a good like

2915
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Manhattan in there. Oh well then maybe

2916
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
that's the move. I had like two trips

2917
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
ago I had like three Manhattans

2918
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
in there once. And then I hit my

2919
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
then walking to Frozen I hit my hand

2920
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
hard on like a metal like kind of

2921
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
railing somewhere and it was sore for days.

2922
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Oh and that's where the

2923
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
woman was trying to hit on my friend Luke

2924
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and I. Did you tell this you must have told

2925
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
this one. I probably told this story I think.

2926
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
There was like a couple

2927
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
we think but then we're like maybe they weren't a couple

2928
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
and this woman was like

2929
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
like coming on to me and my friend

2930
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Luke who were there. I was there although

2931
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I was there with my friends who were

2932
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
married and Lindsay was not there.

2933
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
That was this trip. Cause I had

2934
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
a third wheel trip. I was a third wheel

2935
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
already. Yeah I had an annual pass.

2936
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I bought an because at the time it made

2937
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
sense to get the if I was going once to Disney

2938
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
World it was still a time when it

2939
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
made sense to get the

2940
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
premier pass. Oh yeah you're speaking my language.

2941
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Yeah. For Disneyland and Disney World.

2942
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Yeah to get both parks cause it was literally

2943
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
like you may as well just get it cause then you get

2944
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
more access to Disneyland.

2945
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Every day of the year. Every day of the year.

2946
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Any park. It was amazing. Amazing

2947
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
time to be alive and I was like well

2948
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
now it's just like if I can get a quick trip in

2949
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and my friends were flexible so I

2950
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
went with them and Lindsay had work so I

2951
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
was there alone drinking three

2952
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Manhattans with them in the Abra Kedabra

2953
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and then a woman was like you're both so handsome

2954
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
like it was like it was not

2955
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
like one of the things we were like inferring

2956
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
what's going on. It was like a very strong

2957
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
sort of. We saw you from across the bar

2958
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and liked your vibe. It was just up

2959
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
into that. That was not what happened.

2960
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
We had to bail quickly because

2961
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
it was very strange.

2962
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Wait you have had a stress test

2963
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
not a marriage stress test at that

2964
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
time but

2965
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
on Disney property. That's

2966
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
true yeah you're right. Do I throw it all away

2967
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
for one night with the two

2968
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
babes and what if

2969
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
my friend Luke. One woman in it on two

2970
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
men. Oh I thought there was a second.

2971
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
No no she was with a male friend like male

2972
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
husband maybe like we got

2973
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
a vibe it was like her husband but then maybe

2974
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
it was obvious like or they have

2975
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
an understanding. So that night

2976
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
the swing was not isolated

2977
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
at Jelly Rolls.

2978
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It was at a few establishments

2979
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
at the boardwalk. I think you mean

2980
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
the Fins. Fins is where

2981
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
it all goes down. What's that?

2982
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Fins. Which is where's Fins? The bar

2983
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
at Walt Disney World's Swan.

2984
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Swan's the bigger one.

2985
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Cause that's the Convention Center hotel so everyone's

2986
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
there. Everyone's there on business.

2987
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Everyone's going out on the corporate dime.

2988
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Things are happening at Fins.

2989
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Interesting. That's where you swing at Disney.

2990
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
That is if you want to cheat on your spouse at Disney World

2991
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I always say go to Fins.

2992
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Go to Fins.

2993
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Garley's tips. Fins a lock.

2994
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It's just so many hands trying to flag down

2995
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
the bartender and then they all had the sunburn

2996
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
and they all had the tan of the ring

2997
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
but no rings on their fingers.

2998
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
It's a different

2999
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
meaning of Fins up at that Fins.

3000
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Wow that's the content we have

3001
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
not explored on this podcast.

3002
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Swinging tits. You stay there enough

3003
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
and you know to like walk around the lobby

3004
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
after midnight. Interesting.

3005
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
We know what the deal is at the Holiday

3006
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Inn Burbank.

3007
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I think we talked about that

3008
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
not long ago. We spent like a long time

3009
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
at your birthday talking about

3010
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
the Holiday Inn.

3011
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Things I never knew I

3012
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
what do you mean it's gone? It's a different brand now.

3013
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Hotel Burbank.

3014
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It seems real beige-y, hippie.

3015
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
We'll see. We haven't been over there.

3016
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Will the swinging possibilities be as strong

3017
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
as we're praying that they are?

3018
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It seems like that top floor

3019
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
bar that we liked so much I think they

3020
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
realized like oh wow we have amazing

3021
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
we could charge a lot of money for people to come

3022
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
up here. I haven't read

3023
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
done it yet. It's still

3024
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
crappy carpet.

3025
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
In Disneyland Paris is the place to have an affair

3026
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
every quick service restaurant?

3027
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Any corner. Anywhere in the park.

3028
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I don't know.

3029
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I mean maybe one of those weird motels they have.

3030
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Like the little like Toy Story

3031
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
themed rooms I think. On rides.

3032
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
On small worlds. Anywhere

3033
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
any surface. Do anything you want.

3034
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Anywhere you want. City of Love.

3035
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
We were going for a while. I have one

3036
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
little treat at the end here.

3037
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I got curious if there was any

3038
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
promotional material for the opening

3039
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
of the Armageddon attraction

3040
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
or for the Disney Studios

3041
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
park in general.

3042
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
And I could not find any

3043
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
in English or in French.

3044
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
But I did find an hour long

3045
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
opening special in a language

3046
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
that after watching for a little bit I

3047
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
determined to be Dutch.

3048
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
This was made for Dutch

3049
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
television. And it very

3050
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
much in, boy you think you've done

3051
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
like, you think you've seen it all in terms of crazy

3052
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Disney specials. And then you find

3053
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
the 2002 Disney Studios opening.

3054
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
This thing is so nuts.

3055
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It is the through line of it

3056
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
is it is a group of children

3057
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
who are all going

3058
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
to experience different

3059
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
they're experiencing all the wonderful

3060
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
new attractions coming to Disney Paris.

3061
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
There's five kids and five attractions.

3062
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Perfect. Don't need more than that.

3063
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That's all we got.

3064
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
So it's very like, you know, the skits that

3065
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Regis would do but in all of the different

3066
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
rides. So we end up with

3067
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
this is how they represent Armageddon.

3068
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
There is a scene

3069
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
that is it's basically a madcap

3070
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
ride through the armadillo

3071
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
through the drilling machine that you

3072
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
brought up earlier. That was

3073
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
sitting out in front of the ride. That is not

3074
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
a ride or something that you could do at

3075
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
the park. So they depict

3076
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
like you'll go on a madcap armadillo

3077
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
chase. But in

3078
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
fact this does not happen. Another thing that

3079
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
couldn't happen is the person who appears in this.

3080
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
There are there's celebrities throughout

3081
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
the special but none none more

3082
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
special than who you

3083
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
meet in inside the armadillo.

3084
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Talking about Knight Rider, right?

3085
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Kit. Yeah. So

3086
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Well, I won't reveal the other celebrities shows up a little bit later.

3087
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
But like

3088
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
so basically, you know, like they bump

3089
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
around. He's a

3090
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
the kid Yoshi is driving

3091
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
with kind of weird

3092
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Dutch glasses, very euro kid glasses.

3093
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It's a big crazy

3094
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
ride but they ultimately land. David

3095
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
hits the emergency stop.

3096
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And then this little scene occurs.

3097
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yoshi is

3098
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
handed a big Lego

3099
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
looking blue key. Right.

3100
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Fit it in.

3101
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Whoa.

3102
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Then the key glows with

3103
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
then the key is turned CGI and glows

3104
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
and is magic. And then it cuts to who's coming up

3105
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
next. Britney Spears. Original

3106
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Britney Spears appearance in this

3107
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
stupid special. You know that shitty

3108
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Main Street, the indoor Main Street

3109
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
in Disney Studios, Perry, that we haven't talked about.

3110
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I kind of like it.

3111
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Oh, really? OK. I just threw out she I don't

3112
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
like that. I think it's a weird like

3113
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
room. A little bit closer

3114
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
to the room. Is that why you don't know?

3115
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
No, different. It's not always flames.

3116
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
He doesn't like being transported to Hollywood

3117
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
without leaving. I like seeing

3118
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
the big sign shutter bugs

3119
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
and gunga din.

3120
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
But she Britney performs

3121
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
in front of shutter bugs and gunga. This is

3122
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Britney appearance. That's great. There is a

3123
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Destiny's Child performance.

3124
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Really? Oh my God. And

3125
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Andrea Bocelli. I think these are

3126
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
syndicated maybe to other specials.

3127
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
These aren't only for Dutch television. Right.

3128
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
But Britney hands one

3129
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
of the kids a magic key. She does

3130
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
stuff for this Dutch special.

3131
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
But there is but then it builds

3132
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
to one final cameo at the

3133
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
end. So you're out in front of the park

3134
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
and there is

3135
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
some like big glowy mechanism

3136
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
and the kids have all assembled. They all have a magic

3137
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
key. And then

3138
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
here's the culmination of the

3139
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
special. What have all the keys been

3140
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
for? Let's

3141
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
find out.

3142
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Cuba Gooding Jr. for the people

3143
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
listening. Cuba Gooding Jr. is

3144
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
a hundred feet tall

3145
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
and a ghost.

3146
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
He is God.

3147
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I mean. He is the

3148
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
almighty. Yeah. Because it's heavenly

3149
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
life. I made you cars so that I could

3150
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
see a world where everyone suffered.

3151
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I don't know why. It's also

3152
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
hi. My name

3153
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
is Cuba Gooding Jr. Well if they don't

3154
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
know who you are, if you're American, then

3155
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
the name is not going to impress these

3156
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
children. Kids with big Jerry Maguire fans?

3157
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I guess. It doesn't feel like they've met

3158
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
because they don't say wow. They just kind of like

3159
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
listen attentively. They're meeting a strange

3160
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
like if we showed up in

3161
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
the Netherlands and said

3162
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
my name is Mike Carlson

3163
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
doesn't mean anything to unless they're

3164
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
a pipe. Unless there's a pipe. They might be a pipe.

3165
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
They're a right listener. Could be. Do they like

3166
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
screen junkies? You may

3167
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
know me from screen junkies

3168
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
or for being God.

3169
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Then it cuts to this

3170
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
weird other angle behind Cuba. So they did

3171
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
have coverage on this and the kids

3172
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
are staring the wrong way. They were

3173
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
not told to look up in the sky.

3174
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
So anyway, he resolves

3175
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
this plot here. Each of you

3176
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
is a truly outstanding individual

3177
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and I'm glad to hear you still have those keys

3178
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
you found today. Because we

3179
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
have one more surprise for you. Oh my God, he's so big.

3180
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Yeah, he's like Zordon in Power Rangers.

3181
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Now hold it tightly to your keys.

3182
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Now take it out of the way.

3183
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
What? Those golden keys are now yours.

3184
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
They are keys to the studios

3185
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
for each and every one of you to keep.

3186
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
For the rest of your

3187
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
lives.

3188
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Congratulations.

3189
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
What?

3190
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
What?

3191
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Can you clarify something for me?

3192
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
You don't have to reward it with

3193
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
lifetime access after you bravely

3194
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
stuck your thumbs in a leaky

3195
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
dam.

3196
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I, uh, yeah,

3197
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
this is quite a scene, isn't it?

3198
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Cubicating Jr. is God. He

3199
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
takes keys that were already

3200
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
magic and glowing.

3201
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Makes them not magic anymore.

3202
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
He turns them into literal keys. Well, they all turn gold.

3203
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
And now they're

3204
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
actual keys that they have to

3205
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
keep. But they get them into the, I guess

3206
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
essentially they have free admission to this

3207
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
bad theme park. Maybe.

3208
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Or they just have a key to it. But they're actors.

3209
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yeah. So there's not,

3210
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
it's not like they want to contest, right?

3211
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Unless, is that maybe the premise? Maybe they're presented

3212
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
as real kids. And again, I don't speak

3213
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Dutch, so I don't know some of the ins and outs.

3214
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Well, there's like, there's those stories that appear like

3215
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
oh, so and so won like a lifetime

3216
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
pass to Disneyland or something. Yeah.

3217
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Which like still works and

3218
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
unless JPEG's taking it away.

3219
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I gotta make a reservation.

3220
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
That was maybe the first thing you did? They have to start

3221
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
at DCA.

3222
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Get a reservation. Look, we gotta

3223
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
have rules. Uh, but I wonder

3224
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
yeah, are they presenting that as if the kids

3225
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
can get in forever? Maybe? I don't know.

3226
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
If you're one of those five Dutch children and you're

3227
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
grown, uh, let us know

3228
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
do the keys work? Was Britney

3229
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Spears exciting to meet? Was Hasselhoff

3230
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
exciting to be in an armadillo with?

3231
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Hasselhoff in the armadillo

3232
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
is really,

3233
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
that feels like you made that video, Scott.

3234
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Yeah, yeah, that's the most of my, like

3235
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
these bad little, uh, you know, I

3236
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
think they should have put the kit car from

3237
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Knight Rider in. Him having to drop.

3238
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I love, he's such a cheeseball

3239
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
that his acting

3240
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
is just speaking clearly.

3241
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Same thing. The act, acting

3242
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
is the person who enunciates the most.

3243
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Isn't that right? Wouldn't you agree? Um,

3244
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
yeah, this is, boy, the special.

3245
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Boy, oh boy. Wow, good find.

3246
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Yeah, check out that special. Keep a gooding Jr.'s

3247
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
god and, uh, I don't know,

3248
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
as he should be. Yeah, yeah, well earned

3249
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and, Hasselhoff, sorry to interrupt,

3250
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Hasselhoff though, I'm trying to think, was it, uh,

3251
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
he's been in one other pre-show video, is it for

3252
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
that, um, um, Europe park? That weird boat ride

3253
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
and yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, I believe

3254
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
so. It was like, it was the night,

3255
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
it was the kit boats. You're about

3256
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
to board a kit boat. Yeah, but they don't have

3257
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
the rights, that's the park with no rights, and I can't

3258
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
think of the name of it already, but they had no movie

3259
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
rights. There's like knockoff Doc Brown

3260
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
in the parade. You're about to get on

3261
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
the Prince of Boats. And it was like they had a tower

3262
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
of terror. Yes.

3263
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
As well. Called that, but it's not

3264
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
just a drop tower. So their Armageddon

3265
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
is called, like,

3266
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Ultimate Comet 2000.

3267
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Right.

3268
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Yes.

3269
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
They have to shuffle it every six months to

3270
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
make sure no one noticed. Yeah,

3271
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
yeah, yeah. Keep changing the name of it.

3272
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just keep because something might

3273
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
be called that at this point. Yeah.

3274
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
That was the one with the, sorry to keep,

3275
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
that was the Flashdance show?

3276
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I believe so.

3277
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Movieland Italy?

3278
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
We talked about this bizarre, there's an entire park

3279
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
that is like this Armageddon,

3280
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
if you want, as far as I could tell.

3281
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
This seems like the aesthetics of the Armageddon

3282
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
attraction, but a full

3283
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
where, yeah, they

3284
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
basically, they start using IP in

3285
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
the park, like,

3286
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
and this is in Italy, Movieland Italy.

3287
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
They'll do like Batman and the Joker and

3288
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Mary Poppins until the IP rights

3289
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
someone notices from it.

3290
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Pull it, pull it, get it out.

3291
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Yeah.

3292
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
The bride from Kill Bill

3293
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
was walking around the lot

3294
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
with the orange jumpsuit.

3295
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Licensed by Quentin, I'm sure.

3296
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

3297
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Well, anyways,

3298
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I also, now I'm wondering if like

3299
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Cuba took this as,

3300
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
if a hundred foot tall god Cuba

3301
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
took this as the, like,

3302
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I don't know, maybe now I can like,

3303
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
is there any other hundred foot god

3304
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
creatures I could swing with?

3305
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Oh.

3306
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Good question. Now, kids, do you

3307
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
see any other giant swagger,

3308
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
any other translucent giants walking

3309
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
around here?

3310
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Thanks, you're very special.

3311
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Appreciate it.

3312
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Well, thank you for taking us on this journey

3313
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
through this.

3314
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Thank you for allowing me to relive and

3315
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
immediately forget everything we've been

3316
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
through. And it's gone. It's immediately gone

3317
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
except for the marital trauma.

3318
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
It'll be fine.

3319
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
It's worked out so far. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3320
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Yes, yeah. We all,

3321
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
our marriages have survived our trip to Armageddon

3322
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
and you survived Podcast The Ride.

3323
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Thanks so much for joining us again.

3324
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Let's exit through a leg

3325
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
gift shop. Is there anything you'd

3326
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
like to plug? Yeah,

3327
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
my podcast, very amusing.

3328
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
We're back every week.

3329
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I haven't made a

3330
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
itinerary or schedule, so we're

3331
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
winging it. But so far so good.

3332
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
We got episodes. They're coming out.

3333
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
It's great. And then you can find me on social

3334
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
and all the social medias at Carly

3335
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Weisel. Fantastic.

3336
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
And yeah, thanks so much for being

3337
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
back again. Great to do it IRL.

3338
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Of course. It's so nice to be

3339
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
in person and still distanced.

3340
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Oh, great.

3341
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
It's a comfortable, less claustrophobic than a

3342
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Russian spaceship.

3343
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000

3348
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
The Ride. I'm a little hankering to do

3349
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Cars Road Trip.

3350
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Cars Road Trip's been calling out to me.

3351
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
This, this, the Smilin,

3352
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
the big Smilin tanker

3353
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
is his old world lights on fire.

3354
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
A lot of messages about accepting

3355
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
your demise.

3356
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
This park. The whole park.

3357
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah. You know what? It's, I applaud

3358
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
this park for getting us comfortable

3359
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
with the idea of death.

3360
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Yeah. I found the

3361
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
person, there's a theory, of course,

3362
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
with the cars. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

3363
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
This is just their hypothesis or their

3364
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
questioning the fact that cars still have all the things

3365
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
that you would need for a human. They have handles,

3366
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
they have windows. They lock.

3367
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
They, you hear in the first thing, you hear cars

3368
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
go like boop boop. Yeah.

3369
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So there's, so basically, we'll talk about

3370
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
this when we do Cars Road Trip very soon, I guess,

3371
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
is that this person's guess

3372
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
is that humans evolved into cars.

3373
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Whoa.

3374
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Wow.

3375
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
What are the intermediate

3376
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
steps? Those are some weird,

3377
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
that evolution has some very awkward

3378
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
periods. Yes, I agree.

3379
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
But yes, the humans are

3380
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
the cars. Maybe not evolved. Maybe like

3381
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
there was something, I don't know,

3382
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
a curse was put on the earth or something. Like something

3383
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
happened or Jay Leno. Aren't there

3384
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
too few cars? Like there would have had

3385
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
to have been a genocide?

3386
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Like there had to have been something. Because there's not

3387
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
that many cars in cars. In the cars?

3388
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Hmm. That's a good question. What is the population

3389
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
of the earth in cars?

3390
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And if it's all cars, it's not that many.

3391
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Yeah, because you don't see a ton. Well, we

3392
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
don't get a sense of the full world.

3393
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
There's not even traffic in those films, is there?

3394
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
In the second one? It depends. Sometimes

3395
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
on the way to the women's restroom

3396
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
is what they pause. That's the traffic. Right.

3397
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I can't think about it.

3398
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Yeah. So. Didn't we

3399
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
say, I had the theory in our Late Shift

3400
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
episode on the second gate that Jay

3401
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Leno has sex with the cars?

3402
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Yeah. How Jay Limo,

3403
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
his character, was produced.

3404
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Is that the literal offspring of

3405
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
He's the missing link. Jay Leno,

3406
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
yes. The key to the cars universe

3407
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
is that Jay Leno had sex

3408
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
with one of his classic cars and miraculously

3409
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
the car gave birth

3410
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
to Jay's

3411
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
baby. So he would be

3412
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
alive. I got the miracle of life.

3413
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Have you heard about this? And he has so many

3414
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
cars and he's poly

3415
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
with his cars.

3416
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
If we're mapping over the... I can't get locked down.

3417
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I'm married to one woman. Why would I be married to one car?

3418
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
He's monogamous with Mavis,

3419
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
but poly with the cars. I got a thousand

3420
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
hole passes. His hole passes

3421
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
every car.

3422
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
One year for Christmas

3423
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
she gave it to him. On one side it said hole pass

3424
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and on the other side it said every car.

3425
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
So Cars is a movie about Jay

3426
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Leno's kids.

3427
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Everyone you're looking at is descended

3428
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
from Jay Leno. Yes. Okay.

3429
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I'm not super knowledgeable about Planet of the Apes,

3430
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
but is Caesar the one who...

3431
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Is Caesar the ape who

3432
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
gains intelligence from Jay?

3433
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
By his speaks. Yeah. Okay.

3434
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
No!

3435
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
With that by saying no it opened up

3436
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
the hole. Right, right.

3437
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It was Jay saying, yes! I will

3438
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
have sex with the car.

3439
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Eventually his head will

3440
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
open real big like

3441
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Beetlej and it just honk.

3442
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Beep beep.

3443
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
When he's still alive in

3444
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
300 years. Why is he?

3445
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Oh, because he's a car. Yeah.

3446
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
In the parking garage

3447
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
slash ashes of flappers

3448
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
at the Magic and Comedy Club.

3449
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Well, that's what that whole

3450
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
episode is going to be like.

3451
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
We're off to the races.
