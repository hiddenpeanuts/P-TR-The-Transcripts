1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,480
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,540
where today we're in treat country.

4
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined digitally

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,520
by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,800
Mm, smell the fresh air of treat country.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
Mm, delicious.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
The freshly mined fudge.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,680
It's mined, fudge is mined?

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,300
It's extracted.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,360
I guess it's kind of like the consistency of oil,

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,080
so I guess extracted.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,200
Like, is it fracked?

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,980
Can you frack fudge?

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,040
Oh, boy.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,600
Let's introduce Scott Gardner before we get into this,

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,760
because yeah, this is a conversation I could have all day.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,640
Yeah, hi, and there is mythology about this,

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,840
and I was scrambling right before we started

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,520
and discovering some recent factoids

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,240
about the logistics of the Keebler tree,

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,920
including that they call it the fact tree.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,760
Yes.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,400
The fact tree, so it's T-R-E-E at the end.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,520
Yes, yeah, that's late breaking for me.

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,680
Do you have the diagram, the drawing

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,680
that goes down into the earth?

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,760
I do not.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm very glad that you do.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,040
Okay.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,920
But you drilled deeper in your research, in fact.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,080
Well, you know, I gotta give a lot of credit

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,440
to Advertising Week, because they,

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,360
very in-depth series on the Keebler universe.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,580
Yeah, they seem to, is that the primary reason

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,940
for that publication existing?

37
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,940
Yeah, I think, you know, convincing people

38
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,340
within advertising that advertising is moral and good,

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,780
and that they're doing something, right?

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,060
I mean, hey, there's no argument for me

41
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,820
on it being moral and good when we're dealing

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,260
with these magical creatures who help deserts

43
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,700
taste uncommonly good.

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,540
Sure.

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,540
Yeah, no, this, look, the Keebler elves,

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,140
I think of them in the same way.

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,820
I think of great heroes in American history.

48
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,420
I think of, you know, who are the greatest heroes

49
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,260
in American history?

50
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,420
Well, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln,

51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,540
Buckets, the Keebler elf.

52
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,100
Patrick Henry, that's a guy, right?

53
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,020
Patrick Henry, yes.

54
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,300
The furniture.

55
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,120
Thomas O'Leary.

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,020
What?

57
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,840
I don't know.

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,900
Thomas O'Leary?

59
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,080
Was he the cow guy?

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,060
Oh, Mrs. O'Leary?

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,740
Were they related to Thomas O'Leary and Mrs. O'Leary?

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,820
I'm not sure.

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,660
Are you excited?

64
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,500
Sounds Irish though.

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,780
This is a hero from a different land.

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,180
I don't know if he counts.

67
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,700
I'm thinking of Mrs. O'Leary who had the cow

68
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,620
that knocked over the candle that started the Chicago fire,

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,820
which I guess is not a hero in American history,

70
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,780
if I think about it.

71
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,940
I guess I'm sounding like an idiot now.

72
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Did a cow also knock over a vial and cause COVID-19?

73
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,580
Oh, yeah, whose cow was it?

74
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,020
It's not a question of was it a cow, it's whose cow was it.

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah, I didn't even acknowledge that that was the actual fact.

76
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,880
I just said yes, I agreed with you

77
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,980
and started speculating on the owner of the cow

78
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,940
that created this horrible virus.

79
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,740
We gotta find this cow and if not kill it,

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,340
then just punish it, just make it feel real bad.

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,680
Shame it.

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,060
Yes, yeah.

83
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,280
Shame a cow.

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,780
Cancel the cow, you are canceled.

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,620
The first cow that's been canceled.

86
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,540
What you caused.

87
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,180
Yeah, should Mrs. O'Leary's cow have been canceled

88
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,940
for starting the Chicago fire?

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,580
I think so, but they didn't have that word back then.

90
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Yeah, you might say that canceling was not a thing,

91
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,380
but now that it is a thing, Mrs. O'Leary's cow,

92
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,940
you are most definitely canceled.

93
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,420
Yeah, although now that I think about it,

94
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,740
the cow probably perished in the fire.

95
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,620
So I guess that happened.

96
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,220
Anyway, that's too dark.

97
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,980
That's too dark, yeah.

98
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,660
We'll save that for the full Mrs. O'Leary's cow episode.

99
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,820
We've done a cow episode already on the second gate.

100
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,900
We have.

101
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,740
Oh, you're right, second cow episode.

102
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,920
Wow, second cow on the second gate.

103
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,300
That Kamini moo definitely not canceled,

104
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,580
unless you consider dying being canceled.

105
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,340
It kind of do.

106
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,700
I'm not sure.

107
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
I think it's if you die,

108
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,580
you can be canceled post death, such as Michael Jackson,

109
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,460
but I think people sometimes are more of heroes

110
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,300
in their death.

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,060
So you wouldn't call that being canceled.

112
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,020
Yeah, that's true.

113
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,860
Which is true of the Keebler elves,

114
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,660
if they ever passed away, and let's pray that they don't.

115
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,780
No, I think they're immortal.

116
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,020
Yeah, seemingly, although somewhere in the mythology

117
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,580
in looking into this, I believe that when these ads debuted

118
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,540
in the late 60s, it was not the same elves

119
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,100
that we see today.

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,540
That doesn't negate that they're immortal.

121
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,940
You're 100% right.

122
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,580
Those 60s Keebler elves all looked like

123
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,180
they had been in the war.

124
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,380
They looked hardened.

125
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,300
They looked like either World War II or Korea.

126
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,500
They had seen some shit before they came back

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,980
to the home front.

128
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,460
They came back to America.

129
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,460
They got good paying factory union jobs.

130
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,540
But they all look like when the comedian Todd Glass

131
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,100
does that joke about how his father used to smoke

132
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,340
and he scrunches up his face real tight.

133
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,260
That's what the Keebler elves look like in the 60s.

134
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,980
I'm not familiar enough.

135
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Do we think that if they are immortal

136
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,460
and if this factory has been running for a long time,

137
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,300
was it started in the 50s in a post-war,

138
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
now we can enjoy ourselves and eat cookies,

139
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,940
or did it exist before and during the war

140
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,780
it converted to make artillery and bullets?

141
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,020
I'd like to think they were helping with the war effort.

142
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,540
I think probably, probably with small things like shells.

143
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,140
There's no room to build a tank in the tree

144
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,820
unless there's a subterranean area

145
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,020
and we'll get into that.

146
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,300
But yeah, I think they made little stuff.

147
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Yeah, like they were rationing sugar and flour

148
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,540
during World War II.

149
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,740
So all of the baked goods companies switched

150
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,140
to small caliber bullets,

151
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,140
similar to how all breweries switched to dairy goods,

152
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,660
milk and ice cream during prohibition.

153
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,340
Makes sense.

154
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,620
Did they make fudge bullets?

155
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,700
Well, my question was,

156
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,940
did the shells have a chocolate shell on them?

157
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,300
I think that maybe just out of habit,

158
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,420
that's what they were doing.

159
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,300
So if you were shot by one of these,

160
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,620
that would hurt because it's coming at you full force.

161
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,460
It would kill you.

162
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,940
But if you just picked up a chocolate shell bullet

163
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,740
off the ground and ate it as a snack later,

164
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,900
then deliciousness is your reward.

165
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,780
Yeah, exactly.

166
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,460
It's like if you jumped from very high up

167
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,420
and you landed in the ocean and you got hurt

168
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,140
because you were so high up, it's the velocity.

169
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,740
Water itself is delightful to jump into.

170
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,820
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Well, similar also to keep it in fudge factory terms,

172
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,820
it's buckets.

173
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,660
Buckets, as I'm sure we all learned, spreads the fudge.

174
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,540
But if you dove, yes, from an airplane

175
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,700
into one of buckets of fudge,

176
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,620
then that would hurt very much.

177
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
Right, yes.

178
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,940
That is exactly the, yes.

179
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,420
You're 100, as Jason said, you're 100% right.

180
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
If you fell into the fudge river,

181
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,660
I believe there is a fudge river.

182
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,140
I assume, Jason, it seems like you discovered

183
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,380
all this same stuff, perhaps via advertising weekly.

184
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,540
Yeah, it seems like, well, deep underneath the tree,

185
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,380
there's a fudge spring.

186
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,980
And I texted you guys, there's a cutaway illustration

187
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,180
and you can see them getting the fudge.

188
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,220
There is a fudge submarine in the underground.

189
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,500
Oh, I had to miss the fudge submarine.

190
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,580
Oh my God.

191
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,420
If you look closely, I guess that's an aqua filter,

192
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,380
is that what that's called?

193
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,380
The underground reservoir, essentially.

194
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,340
They've got some advanced technology,

195
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,500
but then they've also got classic buckets

196
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,860
pulling the fudge up.

197
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,700
Yeah, it's a mix of high tech and ingenious low tech.

198
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,020
I mean, yeah, oh my God, what a delight to check my phone

199
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,820
and see what you'd passed along.

200
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,300
That, okay, there's the tree up above the earth,

201
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,740
but then down in the core, it keeps going and going

202
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,900
and like widens out to be twice the width of the tree.

203
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,500
And there's so much going on in there.

204
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,100
Yeah, big like revolving bucket machine and conveyor belts.

205
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,220
It's hard to read the writing.

206
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,340
This is like a quickly drawn sketch.

207
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,100
I think this like came to Ernie the elf in a dream.

208
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,180
He and just like, all right, let me just get it down

209
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,900
or I'm gonna forget.

210
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,100
But there's a baking room, there's a spread the fudge room.

211
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,340
What's the bottom, is it described as a fudge spring?

212
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,700
Yeah, to the left in the picture, it says fudge spring,

213
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,900
but it's clearly pooling.

214
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,700
I have another picture too that says the hollow tree

215
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,140
also has a deck where the gang gathers to celebrate

216
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,140
fresh baked townhouse crackers

217
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,380
and seems to only be accessible via trap door.

218
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,860
So that's a little bit of confusing planning on their part.

219
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,500
Is this, are these drawings going to haunt your dreams

220
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,700
like Richard Dreyfus in the, what's the movie?

221
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,540
Close encounters.

222
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,860
Close encounters of the third kind, yes.

223
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,780
I start building the tree.

224
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,060
Like you're gonna be just building tree

225
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,340
and building a fudge submarine.

226
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,180
I think you know the answer to that.

227
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,100
When Jason's eating his mashed fudge for dinner,

228
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,540
he will form the shape of the fudge tree

229
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,700
in the subterranean fudge mine.

230
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,380
Before we get too far, should we just remind everyone

231
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,780
like the impetus, like what inspired us to do this?

232
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,540
Well, this was our second, we're currently recording,

233
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,740
this is the second time we've recorded

234
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,980
during the 2020 quarantine.

235
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,300
And the first time we recorded,

236
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,540
Mike was eating the old fudge cookies.

237
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,380
Yes.

238
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,660
Yeah, I haven't had them in a few years.

239
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,980
I don't have treats in the house,

240
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,140
but when I put an order in for the grocery store,

241
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,820
I said, you know what, let's do something fun.

242
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,660
And I got a yellow fudge.

243
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,540
This was when you were in like a pit,

244
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,940
you're thinking I'm maybe loading up

245
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,540
for who knows how long groceries could be tough to get,

246
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,900
only necessities and I need them fast if I'm to survive.

247
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,460
And you put on that list EL fudge cookies.

248
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,460
Yes, 100% that is what I did.

249
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,220
That wasn't the first thing I added.

250
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,020
I may have put like, you know,

251
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,220
peanut butter or like oatmeal first,

252
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,980
but maybe four or five, fourth or fifth.

253
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,140
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,540
It makes sense because desserts and treats

255
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,420
have certainly been helping me get through all this.

256
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,100
And I've had a high preponderance of,

257
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,940
it's been like chips and salty snacks

258
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,740
and stuff I don't usually have at home,

259
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,100
but at the moment, fuck it.

260
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,300
I'll be honest, I haven't had much of an appetite.

261
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,860
I have lost like four pounds in two weeks.

262
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,860
Well, congrats.

263
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,700
Yeah, thank you.

264
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,820
Yeah, thanks, it's great.

265
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Has Jason's treat intake increased or stayed the same,

266
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,300
that being that there's like 10 chocolate buckets

267
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,780
in your apartment at any given time.

268
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,140
Yeah, I think my intake has stayed the same,

269
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,140
but I kind of went on a buying, not a buying spree,

270
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,540
but I definitely stocked up.

271
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,900
I was surprised though, because there has been,

272
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,460
the stores have been well stocked with like treats.

273
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,900
You know, you always hear during times of trouble,

274
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,020
people go for like salty and sweet snacks quickly, you know?

275
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,060
So I thought, but Trader Joe's has been pretty well stocked.

276
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,660
Well, I think, yeah, there's been not a lot of,

277
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,300
all the pictures I see are the toilet paper gone,

278
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,100
the water's gone, the milks are gone.

279
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,020
They're not showing pictures of the aisles

280
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,740
of like all the Nabisco cookies are gone.

281
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,860
I think so far people have maybe only gotten,

282
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,860
like their priority was maybe essential things, I guess.

283
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,700
Yeah.

284
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,060
I guess.

285
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,340
But maybe there's more, maybe there's just more stock,

286
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,300
I don't know.

287
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,700
This by Mike Bear mentioning,

288
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,020
I did a little Google hang with a friend of the show,

289
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Buzz Buzz, and he pointed out that he had to do a target run

290
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,420
in a pinch like, oh, I better actually stock up.

291
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,460
And the only thing resembling like milk or something like,

292
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,740
like liquid with nutrition in it

293
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,420
was something called Ripple.

294
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,180
There was a shelf that was full of so much Ripple.

295
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,220
And one of the boasting points of Ripple

296
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,540
was that it is high in ripatine.

297
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,380
What?

298
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,380
I don't know.

299
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,900
But if anyone out there, if you're feeling low on ripatine,

300
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,860
if you have children with you within this trying time

301
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,820
and they're running out of ripatine,

302
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,700
I do have the product for you.

303
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,500
The good people of Ripple have presumably just

304
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,060
are overstocking the shelves.

305
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,620
It can't be that there's no interest in Ripple.

306
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,220
Well, I hadn't thought about my ripatine levels,

307
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,220
but now I won't be able to sleep.

308
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,940
It's the first thing to go and you can't go outside.

309
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,780
You get it from the sun.

310
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,260
So all of us being cooped up,

311
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,300
we're not soaking up sweet ripatine.

312
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,420
Maybe there's ripatine in EL fudges.

313
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,460
Could be.

314
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,380
I gotta go-

315
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,420
In this chocolate.

316
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,220
I mean, this isn't a controversial opinion,

317
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,900
but I'm gonna say EL fudges, one of the goats,

318
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,780
one of the greatest of all times when it comes to cookies,

319
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,780
at least like big mass produced cookies, delicious fudge,

320
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,100
solid cookies in the shape of fun elves,

321
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
but that shortbread isn't overwhelming.

322
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,820
Sometimes I find Milano's,

323
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,300
like you're tasting so much cookie

324
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,980
and not enough chocolate kit.

325
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,180
You don't really have that problem with EL fudge.

326
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,300
Right, and they also have double EL fudges now.

327
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,140
Well, I like that.

328
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,100
I didn't know that.

329
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,940
Yeah.

330
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,340
Were you wearing a hat and did it blow off when I said that?

331
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,620
Unfortunately, all of the recording equipment

332
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,060
has blown across the room.

333
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,740
So my channel is gonna sound like shit for a while

334
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,460
while I collect myself.

335
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,420
Let's do a little, like before we get into the elves

336
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,060
and what they're like and who their best friends are,

337
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,900
maybe let's do a little,

338
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,500
like just our relationship with these cookies

339
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,180
and a little history of the actual company.

340
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,500
Does that sound like a decent spot to start?

341
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,340
Yes, yeah.

342
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,460
I mean, obviously like Keebler cookies, a big staple

343
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
at all of our childhoods, I assume?

344
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,740
Yeah.

345
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,020
I would say so.

346
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
I'd say so.

347
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,660
I haven't like thought about them or had them

348
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,660
in a long time and truly there was a big just spark of joy

349
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,860
when you brought them up the other day.

350
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,020
I feel like my grandma got them for me the most.

351
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,500
I think, you know, that's a little like treat that,

352
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,380
you know, way that parents and grandparents

353
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,740
can differentiate themselves,

354
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,940
those treats that are only at grandma's house.

355
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,180
And I believe that EL fudges were only at grandma's house.

356
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,100
Interesting.

357
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,500
And fruit by the foot.

358
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,860
That's what I remember.

359
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,060
Really, grandma would buy fruit by the foot?

360
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,900
Yeah, she knew I liked that.

361
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,180
And I think my parents didn't wander around all the time.

362
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,660
So yeah, grandma's house is a special place

363
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,460
where I got fruit by the foot.

364
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,660
Where I ordered fruit in a different way.

365
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,740
I feel like fruit by the foot

366
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,660
was not on my grandmother's radar.

367
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,300
I think maybe I made her aware.

368
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,380
Maybe I just like was talking about it

369
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,300
for, you know, half an hour one day.

370
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,660
And then it has shapes.

371
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,300
And then as a reward for eating it,

372
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,860
you get like trivia games and mazes.

373
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
Isn't that right?

374
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,580
Like you peeled it off and there'd be

375
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,420
you know, like little stuff on the paper.

376
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,420
I just think that like fruit by the foot

377
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,660
was too new of an innovation for my grandmother

378
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,820
to be aware of it.

379
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,020
Not that, I mean, she, you know,

380
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,460
she used to more of a traditionalist

381
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,700
when it came to like snacks.

382
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,900
We would have the like chessmen cookies at her house.

383
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,740
Oh, of course.

384
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,780
And those are a classic cookie.

385
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,700
My grandmother's tended to be whatever kind

386
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,780
of like basic snack you could think of blank.

387
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,540
Like chips or cookies, but stale.

388
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,180
So chips, but stale.

389
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,780
Cookies, but stale.

390
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,100
Because she would like have like chip clips or whatever,

391
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,540
but would never quite put them on very good.

392
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,860
So everything would just get a little stale or soft.

393
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,500
Yeah, that's, I feel like what's funny about it,

394
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,060
is that my grandmother would have like

395
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,700
a lot of expired salad dressings.

396
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,620
And a couple of years ago, I went home to visit my parents

397
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,860
and I noticed they had about five expired salad dressings.

398
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,900
And I was like, oh, you're turning into your parents.

399
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,460
It's happening.

400
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,740
It's, yeah, it's happening.

401
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,220
The more, yeah, if your parents have a bunch of like packets,

402
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,740
if you start, you know, having a lot of packets

403
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,100
in the drawers, that's maybe not a good sign.

404
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,940
Yeah, like three-year-old packets.

405
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,020
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,940
Like, you know, hot sauces from, or like, you know, like,

407
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,940
what P.F. Chang's gives you to go for many years.

408
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,540
Like I might use this sweet and sour sauce in seven years.

409
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,300
Yes, so I think, now you've got me thinking.

410
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,660
I don't think we had a lot of Keebler at my grandmother's

411
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,140
house as much as we had at home.

412
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,980
I think it was more of a home base, Keebler.

413
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,860
Jason, where were you at as a family?

414
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,900
I mean, I love the Keebler commercials.

415
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,140
And I think we would get it sometimes.

416
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,580
I feel like we defaulted to Nabisco a lot.

417
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,940
Or, I mean, Little Debbie is the cheap,

418
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,620
Little Debbie is barely food.

419
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,380
Like they can barely charge for that.

420
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,380
There is so little actual food in it.

421
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,540
But my, the portions.

422
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,460
So we would definitely have Keebler stuff.

423
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,340
My memory watching, Scott, you had found a compilation

424
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,140
of commercials and stuff, and then that just auto-played

425
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,980
a million other commercials.

426
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,580
That brought back a big memory for me,

427
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,580
which was the 90s trend of something that's like a chip,

428
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,220
but not quite a chip.

429
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,060
Like everything was so, there was like a war

430
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,340
to sell chip alternatives.

431
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,380
Like it's a cracker, but it crunches like a chip.

432
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,260
Like chips were insanely popular,

433
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,060
but everyone knew they were bad for them.

434
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,900
So everyone would be like,

435
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,060
well, this cracker's a little better.

436
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,980
That said, as a child, I think I was about 90% pizzerias,

437
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,220
if you remember.

438
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,700
Those commercials were in here.

439
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,220
Pizzerias were like the cracker chip pizza flavored one.

440
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,340
And I loved those.

441
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,780
Oh man, we were, I'd never heard of pizzerias

442
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,340
until watching this commercial now.

443
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,180
And I was so grossed out by the idea of them.

444
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,260
I don't think I ever had them either.

445
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,420
Yeah, I had them a lot.

446
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,260
Had them a lot.

447
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,660
You will.

448
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,300
They don't make, is there any,

449
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,780
what is the closest thing that is made that's like these?

450
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,620
Do we know?

451
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,380
Like that exists today?

452
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,300
Only like Pringles and Combos

453
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,900
have like pizza flavored anything anymore.

454
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,380
Pizza, I hated everything pizza flavored.

455
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,740
I don't think it's a reproducible.

456
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,900
The flavor was so far off.

457
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,740
It was some other thing that didn't resemble pizza.

458
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,620
Well, I think I agree with that.

459
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,260
Pizzerias were the exception though.

460
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,180
They were really good.

461
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,260
Missed out.

462
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,300
Well, we'll be covering pizzerias

463
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,980
because that is the main source of,

464
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,980
that's where JJ and Zoot factor in, the young people.

465
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Gen Z of the Keebler factory.

466
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,180
And Dude?

467
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,300
There is a, is there Micro?

468
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,980
Was Micro one of the newer ones too?

469
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,740
Well, he had the shrink powers.

470
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,580
He would shrink stuff down.

471
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,980
He had shrinking powers, right.

472
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,060
But no, let's do a quick history.

473
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,900
A quick history before we get into the else.

474
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,940
Quick history, yeah.

475
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,100
Sure.

476
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,380
It was started by Godfrey Keebler,

477
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,260
Godfrey Keebler of German descent.

478
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,860
He started it in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1853.

479
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,660
Does that make the pride?

480
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,340
Did you know that Jason?

481
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,660
I did not know that.

482
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,580
A lot of bakeries, Philadelphia had a big bakery business.

483
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,900
My grandfather was a security guard,

484
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
bakery and confectionary.

485
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,900
My grandfather was security guard at the Whitman's factory.

486
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,100
Whitman's samplers.

487
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,500
I know, yeah, yeah.

488
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,260
So did you ever encourage him to, you know,

489
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,020
get into those places where he's not supposed to sneak into

490
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,340
and bust out some treasured goods

491
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,900
for his beloved grandson?

492
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,620
I mean, I would have, I think he had retired.

493
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,980
I think that was, he was the kind of guy

494
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,100
who had like a million jobs.

495
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,540
I think he had retired by that point.

496
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,300
He may have known where the Chocolate River was though.

497
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,420
That's true. The chocolate stream.

498
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,300
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,700
So they opened the bakery in 1853,

500
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,020
his bakery network with several other local bakeries

501
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,340
around the country over the years.

502
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,660
And then in 1927, they merged into

503
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,780
the United Biscuit Company of America.

504
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,660
Hell yeah.

505
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,580
United Biscuit. You absolutely,

506
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,060
you love to see it.

507
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,860
God bless the UBCA.

508
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,460
The stars and the cook, the fudge,

509
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,820
the fudge stars and fudge stripes.

510
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,580
United Biscuit.

511
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,380
And then, you know, there's some, some business stuff there.

512
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,980
And then they, oh, and they made Girl Scout cookies in 1936.

513
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,500
The official baker of Girl Scout cookies.

514
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
Oh really?

515
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,180
Not always, but when they started.

516
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,980
I think it says here by 1978,

517
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,740
four companies were producing cookies.

518
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,220
So Little Brownie Bakers is the Keebler division

519
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,820
that still is licensed to produce the cookies.

520
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,260
The Little Brownie Bakers.

521
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,140
Now I think the actual bakers of Girl Scout cookies

522
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,780
might vary by region.

523
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,540
I think that might be correct, yes.

524
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,580
I think the Carmel Delights, is that their current name?

525
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,060
The ones that used to be called Samosas.

526
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,820
Some stuff is called different stuff in different regions

527
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,100
and tastes a little different, apparently.

528
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,020
So Keebler basically, they like changed hands a lot

529
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,020
and then they were acquired by Kellogg in 2001.

530
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,420
Oh, I didn't realize that.

531
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,940
But there's some new,

532
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,700
there's a lot of different changing hands of this brand.

533
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,980
But I believe, did anyone catch this?

534
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,580
The last thing is that they were sold to the people

535
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,900
who make Nutella?

536
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,060
Oh, interesting.

537
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,900
Let me find this.

538
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,740
I have too many, again, I said too many notes

539
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,940
for the Keebler company and the elves.

540
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,660
Too many things, too many things.

541
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,480
Too many things.

542
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,500
Keebler sale, Ernie Keebler and his cookie factory

543
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,140
housed in a tree are being bought by the Ferrero Group,

544
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,580
makers of Nutella.

545
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,820
And that is from last year.

546
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,780
Okay. The Ferrero Group.

547
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
The Ferrero Group.

548
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,140
Is that the German company that owns Los Pueos Hermanos

549
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,740
where the guy killed himself

550
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,540
with the heart-zapping machine?

551
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,700
Yes, that is the same.

552
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,180
That is the exact same, yes.

553
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,700
This is April 1st, 2019, or 2019, yeah, 2019.

554
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,300
Yeah, I'm sorry.

555
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,980
And that's Kellogg sells Keebler snacks to Ferrero

556
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,580
for $1.3 billion.

557
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,940
Wow.

558
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,020
And they also got the six US manufacturing plants

559
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,220
in the deal.

560
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,660
All that history is important backstory,

561
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,220
but the main thing to say is that when they started

562
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,060
making cookies in 1853, it was reported

563
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,180
that there were elves on the scene

564
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,700
and that those were the ancestors

565
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,580
of the famous Keebler elves known today.

566
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,880
That is some official copy that I read,

567
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,840
which again implies that they are not immortal.

568
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
If there's such a thing as ancestors,

569
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
unless you just hit kind of an age

570
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,960
where you're no good to make them anymore,

571
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,520
and then you just like live out

572
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,920
thousands of years in retirement.

573
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Well, you know what?

574
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,960
I know elves and gnomes aren't the same thing,

575
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,560
but as we've discussed on the show, David the Gnome,

576
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,000
the finale of David the Gnome is that the cartoon series

577
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,120
from, I guess, the 80s is that David and his wife

578
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,320
essentially die in the finale

579
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,720
and become one with the earth.

580
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,280
So maybe it is similar with the elves.

581
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,600
I would think.

582
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,680
That they go somewhere and they make their pet watch

583
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,520
while they die, which is what David the Gnome did

584
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,040
with his pet fox, Swift, as Swift watched in horror

585
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,280
as David and his wife turned into trees.

586
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,520
I have to think it's somewhere between a Viking funeral

587
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,760
or the end of the Lord of the Rings

588
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,920
where they just get on a boat and sail away into the horizon.

589
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,160
They did, you know, when it's an elves time to go,

590
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,120
they just get on a boat and an arrow is shot at it

591
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,400
that's on fire and it just slowly burns up

592
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,880
and then sinks into the fudge spring

593
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,600
and then they become fudge.

594
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,280
So we're eating the elves, really.

595
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,880
It's like the circle of life.

596
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,880
It's like the antelope eat the grass after the lions die.

597
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,040
Either that or there's a transference of energy

598
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,480
and they just get shot with the rainbow cannon

599
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,160
and they become energy.

600
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,760
Well, a lot of the cookies look like elves.

601
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,120
There is that one variety.

602
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,600
So it is that could be that we are,

603
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,600
those are like sarcophagi and the fudge inside is them

604
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
that you are eating their body.

605
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,720
Oh, like the stone soldiers in China.

606
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,680
Like that tomb that has all those stone soldiers.

607
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Exactly, yes.

608
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,440
The Terracotta army, I believe.

609
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,280
Yeah.

610
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,120
Yeah.

611
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,920
And just to mention P.F. Chang's for the second time.

612
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,400
Yeah, if you see those statues outside of every P.F. Chang's,

613
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,800
those contain the actual remains of soldiers.

614
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,280
Big statues like that ever since I was a kid

615
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,520
and I saw Ghostbusters and the animals,

616
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,520
the statues in front of the New York Public Library

617
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,440
come to life.

618
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,080
That always freaked me out as a kid.

619
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,880
And I was like, I don't like those big animal statues.

620
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,560
Could happen, could happen anywhere.

621
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,080
It could happen.

622
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,000
And those, and every cookie you bite into

623
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,040
could come to life if you, again, if you wait long enough.

624
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,680
So it's imperative that you chomp them all

625
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,960
as quickly as you can. That you gobble them down.

626
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,800
Yeah.

627
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,760
Yeah, yeah, hurry up or they'll swarm.

628
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,200
They'll drag your whole body down.

629
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
Mike, you brought up a good point

630
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,920
that they are different than gnomes.

631
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,560
And in fact, in the copy that I was just reading

632
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,480
right above it, that specifically is specified.

633
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,280
And this is coming from Ernie, the primary Keebler elf.

634
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Ernie wants to be clear that the Keebler elves

635
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,680
are not leprechauns, gnomes, or dryads.

636
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,040
Dryads I've never heard before.

637
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,680
That's new mythology to me.

638
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,600
I had to look up a picture of what one was.

639
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,360
They are freakier than elves are, certainly.

640
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,320
What are they, they're in, I'm looking,

641
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,400
and then folklore and Greek mythology.

642
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,160
It's a nymph inhabiting a forest or a tree.

643
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,280
Oh.

644
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,600
Not inhabit, not like bringing,

645
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
it's not like if a tree is alive

646
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,120
and a dryad is what's operating it.

647
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,480
Like if you live in the forest, you're a dryad.

648
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,440
Are there any dryads in fiction?

649
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,600
That's what I'm looking for.

650
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm trying to, there's like, there's pictures of them,

651
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,120
but I'm trying to see, like, who's the most famous dryad?

652
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,080
Examples of dryads.

653
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,520
They're mentioned in Paradise Lost.

654
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
Yeah, but I'm looking for like what

655
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,280
the DreamWorks movie is about dryads.

656
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,320
When is there gonna be a dryads movie?

657
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,880
They're in The Chronicles of Narnia.

658
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,960
Well, they're in Barbie Fairytopia.

659
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,640
I know that.

660
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,640
They're in Lev Grossman's The Magician's Trilogy,

661
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,280
which I believe became the TV show The Magicians.

662
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
Hmm. Right?

663
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Okay.

664
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
Yes, yeah, the Syfy Channel show.

665
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,760
But that said, there's an area,

666
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I mean, it feels like in a couple years, you know,

667
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,120
we could be seeing a DreamWorks,

668
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,560
or maybe I should keep this to myself

669
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,640
and go pitch it to DreamWorks, but like,

670
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,320
we'll be driving by a billboard that says dryads

671
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,360
with a huge list of celebrities playing,

672
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,600
all playing the different dryads.

673
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,320
We got Meghan Trainor in there, Kumail,

674
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,760
Kumail's doing a dryad.

675
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
Yep, yep. The Baby.

676
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,360
Oh, sure, The Baby would make a great dryad.

677
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,360
The Baby, King Princess, Billy Eilish, all the young people.

678
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,640
If you're, yeah, if you're a pop star and you're under 18,

679
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
it's imperative that you play a dryad.

680
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,040
Jojo,

681
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,920
Siwa, Siwa, how do you say it?

682
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,200
Oh, sure, yeah, yeah.

683
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,720
And then like Alan Arkin.

684
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,360
Yeah, yeah, there's gotta be an old cranky dryad.

685
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,200
Absolutely.

686
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,080
He obviously gets the and credit, and Alan Arkin.

687
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,360
End of the list.

688
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,200
There's Potts.

689
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,640
Oh, I'm seeing here that male,

690
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,680
like dryads are usually female,

691
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,400
and the male counterpart to dryads are called Druze.

692
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,920
Druze, how do you spell Dru?

693
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,520
D-R-U-S.

694
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,840
Druze I have heard of.

695
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,080
What, why?

696
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,600
You know.

697
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,200
It rhymes with Gru, it's spelled like Gru.

698
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,800
I realize I don't wanna get off on too much of a tangent.

699
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,440
I didn't realize there was another Minions movie

700
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,640
coming out this year that's called The Rise of Gru.

701
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,880
Well, yeah, it's gonna rise.

702
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,040
It's all rise, everyone's rising in these movies.

703
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,880
Everyone's rising, you see the end of the-

704
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,720
And the rise.

705
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,760
At the end of the first Minions, they meet Child Gru,

706
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,760
and now they are, I think, learning, feeling each other out,

707
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,720
figuring stuff out.

708
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,400
And this is Gru's rise.

709
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,560
Yeah, this is his rise

710
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,160
to become an all-powerful super villain.

711
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,840
So it'll be like the end of Rise of Skywalker,

712
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
and he'll name himself,

713
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,720
or he'll say, I'm evil or something at the end.

714
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,360
No, your last name.

715
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,240
I don't have one.

716
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,040
Is that a good Gru?

717
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,720
That's a pretty good Gru.

718
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
I don't have a last name.

719
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,760
Jason, could you say that line as Stitch real quick?

720
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,680
Yeah, hold on.

721
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,520
Okay.

722
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Hold on.

723
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,000
He's gotta prepare.

724
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
It's trick and water.

725
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,440
Yep.

726
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,320
Or he just left.

727
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,880
Jason Sherwin's left.

728
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,960
I don't have a last name.

729
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
That's great.

730
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,200
I think Jason as Stitch just sounded like Gru.

731
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,040
Yeah.

732
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
That's kind of my point is that

733
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,640
Stitch kind of sounds like Gru.

734
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,440
And a little like Subulba.

735
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
And a little like Subulba.

736
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,680
That's true too.

737
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Anyway, that all to say,

738
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,520
so let's be very clear.

739
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
The Keeper Elves are not dryads.

740
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,360
Not dryads.

741
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,680
They're also not shoemakers, fairies, or sprites.

742
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,920
They're a uniquely American strain of elves.

743
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,760
Gotta love hearing the word strain

744
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
at this point in time.

745
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,080
They're not leprechauns either

746
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,920
because one of the commercials leprechauns show up.

747
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,240
A lot of people show up in the commercials

748
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,240
and inconvenience the elves or deny their existence.

749
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,120
I have a list here.

750
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,400
Leprechauns, cops,

751
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,240
a reoccurring pest named Dude.

752
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,440
What's Dude?

753
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
What kind of person is Dude?

754
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,600
Dude is a teenager, like a cool teenager.

755
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,880
I think he was a recurring character in the 90s

756
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,400
where they just gave up.

757
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah, I mean, he's pretty cool.

758
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,680
He looks like Roy from The Simpsons,

759
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,520
the one episode character from the Poochy episode.

760
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Of course, yeah.

761
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,600
There's a skydiver shows up at one point

762
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,520
and they all show up at the kitchen,

763
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,560
tree, door, demanding answers from the elves.

764
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Yeah, and then when Ernie comes out on the perch,

765
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,320
on the porch or whatever, the veranda,

766
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,800
and he seems to be the size of their head.

767
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,960
He's pretty surprisingly big.

768
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,520
I find the scale weird.

769
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,440
I feel like the size of the tree changes a lot from ad to ad.

770
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,720
They really need to pick a scale.

771
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,560
Maybe the Ferrero group will really clamp down

772
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,440
on the mythology.

773
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,760
Yeah, Task 1 standardized the scale.

774
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,160
I also saw some ads where my favorite interrupter

775
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,760
at the factory is like a kind of like a,

776
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,080
he's like a Euro, you know, like Playboy,

777
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,800
gadfly, like old race car driver, like the kind of guy.

778
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,200
He's got like, you know, a mustache and a long nose

779
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,440
and a big scarf, just like cool cocky as hell,

780
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
50s race car driver.

781
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,160
Oh, I saw, yes, I saw him.

782
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

783
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,840
These side characters are really good

784
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,600
for a commercial especially.

785
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,560
We don't have a ton of information about that.

786
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,200
I mean, well, I guess we just said the information

787
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,320
about that, but there's no further information

788
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,080
about them or where they came from,

789
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,280
but the elves, there's certainly a ton.

790
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,720
Right, and like, unlike maybe Chuck E. Cheese,

791
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,920
which does have a lot of like extra material,

792
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
there's not a ton of extra material outside

793
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,400
of the commercials and the packages for these characters.

794
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,240
Yeah.

795
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,960
They never did some like McDonald's style,

796
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,080
let's make a home video or a video game.

797
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,160
They didn't really expand in any significant way.

798
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,280
Well, okay.

799
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,280
I did find evidence of some sort of little extra thing

800
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,640
that anyone, does anyone know what I'm talking about?

801
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,600
No. No.

802
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,760
I have found that there is some sort of 22 minute

803
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,760
anti-drug Keibler elf video out there from the 1980s.

804
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,760
Perfect. Oh boy.

805
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,400
There's an article about it in the Chicago Tribune

806
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,400
from 1986 about a 22 minute video

807
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,200
where the Keibler elves convince kids not to take drugs.

808
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,600
Ironically, getting them hooked on sugar,

809
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,600
which they say is more addictive to kick than some drugs.

810
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,560
And more likely that a kid would have a problem with it

811
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,520
than like crack.

812
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,400
Yes.

813
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,040
Apparently, it might be based on a puppet show

814
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
that was staged in 10 cities.

815
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,840
I believe that's what this article is saying.

816
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,640
And the tape has a three pronged plot.

817
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
The first part shows a,

818
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,200
I don't know why they have to mention this,

819
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,080
a pretty and talented girl confessing to Ernie

820
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,320
that she feels pressured to be the best of all time.

821
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
The second segment shows a track star

822
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,960
who is tempted to use drugs to win a race,

823
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,880
but is shown by Ernie that people like him for what he is.

824
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
People will like him for what he is,

825
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,240
not for him being on drugs.

826
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,280
This is also a weirdly written article.

827
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,640
The last segment points to an 11 year old girl's

828
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,960
misconception about the use of drugs.

829
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,520
She fears her older brother is on drugs,

830
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,080
but through elfin magic,

831
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,560
Ernie allows her to overhear her brother talking to a friend.

832
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,720
And this is what her brother says.

833
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,280
I'd break my sister's neck if she ever got on drugs,

834
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,840
but she's too smart for that, the older brother says.

835
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Jesus, like a Bane kind of statement.

836
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,200
I'd break my sister's neck if she ever did drugs.

837
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
I'll kill her.

838
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,440
You think drugs hurt you, I'll show you hurt.

839
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,200
So we have to find this video.

840
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Yeah.

841
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,040
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,320
It doesn't appear to be on YouTube,

843
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
but somebody has to have it.

844
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,320
Fuck.

845
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,120
I, oh my God.

846
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,640
Like, yeah, walking in, the guy walking in on his sister,

847
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,960
like slightly puffing a joint.

848
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,120
Don't you realize what that could do to you?

849
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,160
That could cause permanent damage.

850
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,920
Cracks her neck.

851
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,520
He was serious.

852
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,040
It's where you were headed anyway.

853
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,920
You know what's scarier than drugs?

854
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,160
Me threatening to murder you.

855
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,200
And then, yeah, so imagine all that,

856
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,160
and then imagine like Ernie Keebler counseling her.

857
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,160
I mean, he is like a good guy.

858
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,360
Like Ernie Keebler, I mean, he's a real, he's a king,

859
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,400
you know, he's a good guy.

860
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,960
They did have a profile essentially,

861
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,160
like a 10 things you didn't know about Ernie Keebler

862
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,640
in advertising week.

863
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,240
I got some good stuff out of there.

864
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,880
His nickname is Mr. Sincerity.

865
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,760
When life gets Ernie down,

866
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,800
he responds with his three favorite folksy expressions.

867
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,120
Mercy, gracious,

868
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,920
and what in tarnation,

869
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,120
which I know I can relate to.

870
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,680
Yeah, I saw that same fact,

871
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
and I was thinking how you should make a point of,

872
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,480
if you can remember, to switch your default profanity

873
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,360
or exclamation to be what in tarnation.

874
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,320
I know my mother would prefer that.

875
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,080
Like all of our mothers, yes.

876
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,840
My favorite fact about Ernie

877
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,160
is that the marketing people created this.

878
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,560
Just as Maslow's hierarchy of needs

879
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,680
has been established for humans,

880
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,120
so has Keebler created quote, need states for Ernie.

881
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,160
His five biggest needs include.

882
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,000
What?

883
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,480
What in tarnation?

884
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,760
His need states, you know, he needs socialization,

885
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,960
nurturing, relaxation, indulgence,

886
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,920
and fun slash creativity.

887
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,440
What?

888
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,280
Isn't this weird?

889
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,040
Like, he's not my baby.

890
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,720
I don't have to raise.

891
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,040
No, he's your God.

892
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,520
You should be telling me about needs states.

893
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,040
I don't think I'm getting them.

894
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,200
I wanna be like him.

895
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,320
Jason, do you have a picture of him in the house,

896
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,880
like how Catholics would have a picture of Kennedy?

897
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,600
Jason bows down and says, gracious.

898
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,760
Jason, are those your picture of grandparents?

899
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,880
Oh no, that's Ernie Keebler and Little Debbie.

900
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,600
Your slash fiction between Little Debbie and Ernie Keebler.

901
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,720
And they're gigantic,

902
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
like those portraits of the knots at Knots Barrymore.

903
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,640
Oh, Little Debbie, you fulfill all of my needs states.

904
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,760
Let me look, is there any slash fiction

905
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,720
involving the Keebler elves or Little Debbie in general?

906
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,040
You know, yeah, I didn't get around to looking that up.

907
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,160
Did you guys look up the multiple actors who have voiced him?

908
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,400
I sure did.

909
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,240
I did.

910
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,720
I got a lot about one.

911
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,600
Okay, good, cause I didn't, there were so many credits

912
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,800
and so many friends.

913
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,520
We haven't even gotten to the friends yet, but if you ask.

914
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,680
Let's cover Ernie, yeah.

915
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,520
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,920
Well, the main thing,

917
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,520
well, there's two interesting things in the credits list.

918
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,880
His current voice is a guy named Richard Hensel

919
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,800
and Richard Hensel is primarily known in media

920
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,840
as the guy, the first guy of the two who says,

921
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,680
okay, campers rise and shine

922
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,480
and don't forget your booties cause it's cold out there.

923
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,160
The DJs in Groundhog Day, the first one,

924
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,560
I believe it's the first one is the current voice

925
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,360
of Ernie the Keebler elf.

926
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,200
Yes.

927
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,960
That's a pretty fun crossover, I feel.

928
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,120
The most interesting one to me though

929
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,960
is his original voice, Parley Bayer.

930
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,880
Did anyone else look into Parley?

931
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Rhymes with Marley, Parley Bayer.

932
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,280
I get a little bit.

933
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,040
They all had interesting careers,

934
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,800
all of these like character actors.

935
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,840
Yeah, yeah.

936
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,920
He has got an odd thing where he plays

937
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,080
several notable racists in media.

938
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,280
There's like where he's like a racist who gets redeemed

939
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,800
or learns his lesson.

940
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,960
One where he's like teaching a dog to be racist

941
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,560
and then another one where it's an episode

942
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,600
of a very special episode of Bewitched

943
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,640
where he is Darren's racist boss.

944
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,280
Were you familiar with this before?

945
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,320
I have not seen this episode, but he's not Larry Tate,

946
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,960
that was Darren's boss.

947
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,800
So he's a different boss?

948
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,760
He's a client probably.

949
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,400
Oh, maybe so, okay, okay.

950
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,040
Cause you, Darren work, of course Darren worked

951
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,160
at an advertising company, we all know that.

952
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,240
Sure, yes.

953
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,600
And it's, yeah, it's this strange, I mean,

954
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,160
I don't even, we don't even need to get into it,

955
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,280
but it's a weird where he like, he mistakes

956
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,200
like a friend of what Tabatha's the daughter,

957
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,400
he mistakes like somebody who's over at the house

958
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,120
for being their daughter and he thinks,

959
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,680
is this an interracial family?

960
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,120
And he has a problem with that.

961
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,800
So Samantha puts a spell on him to where he sees everyone

962
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,320
as black and he learns a lesson about racism that way.

963
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Very bizarre episode and considered important at the time,

964
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,520
so much so that it had like a message from a star

965
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,400
of Bewitched, Elizabeth Montgomery,

966
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,720
and she's delivering this message in front of a sign

967
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,800
that says Oscar Meyer because they were the sponsor

968
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,640
that night.

969
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,640
So she gives an opening speech about like tonight's episode

970
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,760
my friends at Oscar Meyer and I believe

971
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
that tonight's episode can teach you a little something.

972
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,240
Well, you've got my attention.

973
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,320
We gotta watch that episode.

974
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Yeah, the clips are pretty bonkers.

975
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
But anyway, that's the- It sounds like it's good,

976
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,440
their heart was in the right place, that's good.

977
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,320
Oh, it seems really, yeah, and for the 60s

978
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,520
to devote an episode to racial tolerance,

979
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,960
yeah, is fantastic.

980
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,520
And to get our pals at Oscar Meyer involved.

981
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,120
But the main thing that I have to say about Parley Bayer

982
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,920
is that he apparently was, before the war,

983
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,280
he was a circus ringmaster and in doing so,

984
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,820
he met and married a trapeze artist and bareback writer

985
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,760
who stayed his wife his whole life.

986
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,560
Then he went to war, then came back

987
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,160
and got sort of a related job as a wild animal trainer

988
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,360
at a place that is difficult for me to talk about

989
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,080
because that place is called Jungleland USA.

990
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,800
That's in Thousand Oaks, California.

991
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,320
And do you remember why Jungleland USA is notable?

992
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,200
Oh, I'm trying to remember.

993
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,080
No, say it.

994
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,000
Jungleland USA was the primary home base

995
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,360
of a fellow named- Oh, yeah, yes.

996
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,200
Yes.

997
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,040
Chukko.

998
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,480
Yes, yes, I knew.

999
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,600
And I knew when you said that.

1000
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,680
Yes. Yep.

1001
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,040
Yes, yeah.

1002
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,880
Wow.

1003
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,560
I, it's obviously, I'm shaken to even discuss this right now,

1004
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,760
but some of the pure unadulterated evil at Jungleland USA

1005
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,480
caused by the presence of Chukko,

1006
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,000
I think is offset by my good pal Parley Bayer,

1007
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,200
the voice of Ernie the elf being around.

1008
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,000
Wow, man.

1009
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,280
Do you think, side note,

1010
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,440
do you think a full Chukko episode is better

1011
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,940
if we're sequestered, if we're separated,

1012
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,900
or do we have to wait until we're all together again

1013
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,220
for the Chukko episode to finally happen?

1014
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,500
Oh, dear God.

1015
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,220
I don't, well, I don't know if I wanna be alone.

1016
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,820
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

1017
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,220
Chukko may visit us.

1018
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,180
Exactly, that's exactly what I was thinking.

1019
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,020
And if you say his name three times,

1020
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,060
then I'm gonna be stuck here alone with him.

1021
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,540
Oh my God, let's, oh, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1022
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,300
I have, I maybe have the best idea I've had ever.

1023
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,300
Let's do a digital seance to summon Chukko.

1024
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,260
The podcast.

1025
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,660
I will look up how to do a seance,

1026
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,820
we'll all light candles,

1027
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,940
and we will try to talk to Chukko

1028
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,460
and see if we can get him to make peace with Scott.

1029
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,120
Oh my God.

1030
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,820
Look, if there was, my first objection is,

1031
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,780
if there's anybody who's just full of pure COVID,

1032
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,620
I think it's Chukko.

1033
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,420
I think I want him to get tested before this,

1034
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,300
before he's gonna end up in my body.

1035
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,380
He's a spirit.

1036
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,460
But we don't know how far this reaches.

1037
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,300
I don't know.

1038
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,260
We know dogs can't get it, but what about spirits?

1039
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,380
Look, I don't know the answer to that.

1040
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,420
We'll ask him.

1041
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,780
We'll ask him when we do the seance.

1042
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,340
We get five minutes in and Scott's like,

1043
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,340
there is a single red balloon

1044
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,700
floating outside of my window.

1045
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,100
Oh my gosh, okay, even better, okay,

1046
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,980
even better idea that I just had.

1047
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,860
We're recording this a little bit before

1048
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,740
we're gonna do our first Twitch live show.

1049
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,220
How about we do it on Twitch and all the listeners,

1050
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,580
all the listeners light a candle with us

1051
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,020
and we all try to summon Chukko.

1052
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,860
Oh God.

1053
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,260
That's a lot of people.

1054
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,860
That's a lot of people.

1055
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,980
We need to get out of this sequester as quickly as we can.

1056
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,740
This is, you know, this is a great-

1057
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,780
Scott develops a vaccine real quick.

1058
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,100
I figured it out.

1059
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,140
I don't know, it just came through me.

1060
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,380
It chapter one and two where big hits,

1061
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Candy Man is coming back.

1062
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,420
I think it's time for Chukko to come.

1063
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,260
Digital seance.

1064
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,300
I know we like bringing back obscure IP,

1065
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,500
but this isn't the IP I want back.

1066
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Digital seance of summon Chukko, summoning Chukko.

1067
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,580
Oh God.

1068
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,540
Well, how about this?

1069
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,540
Here, I'll add a, what if, as we did this, I took acid.

1070
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,220
Oh my God.

1071
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,060
Yeah.

1072
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,260
Should go fine.

1073
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,540
It's probably just chill me out,

1074
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,580
not make things horrifyingly worse.

1075
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,820
I have a, there's, you know, Ernie Keebler would tell you,

1076
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,740
you probably shouldn't do that though.

1077
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,340
So what are you, what's gonna happen?

1078
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,740
What if I go buy some acid, what are you guys gonna do?

1079
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,060
Are you gonna break my neck?

1080
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,900
Hmm.

1081
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,340
I would break your neck if you did acid.

1082
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,380
I would just find the most unpleasant videos

1083
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,980
of people reviewing new pretzel carts at theme parks.

1084
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,740
Like new pretzel carts, new like bathrooms,

1085
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,220
that sort of thing.

1086
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,460
That I have to watch them?

1087
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,460
And you have to watch them while on acid.

1088
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,420
I'll be looking for ones that like the aspect ratio,

1089
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,980
like the camera keeps changing,

1090
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,380
they're holding their phone vertically,

1091
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,900
and then horizontally the audio keeps pitching in and out.

1092
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,220
Dear Lord, I'll take the neck break.

1093
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,980
Get breaking.

1094
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,860
Now I'm quarantined, but I'll just open the door a crack.

1095
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,500
Break my neck, please.

1096
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,020
Wow.

1097
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,940
I've learned my lesson.

1098
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,860
Fine, we'll summon Chukko.

1099
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,180
We're gonna summon Chukko.

1100
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,420
That's exciting.

1101
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,260
Digital say.

1102
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,140
That's the most excited I've been

1103
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,340
since being locked in the apartment, honestly.

1104
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,020
Oh no, but I think that for a digital seance to work,

1105
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,020
you need like a lot of, you need like a thousand people.

1106
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,540
You need like everyone who subscribes to the Patreon, right?

1107
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,100
Oh yeah, I think you're right.

1108
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,300
Well, that's, there's no way we're gonna get that many.

1109
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,420
Oh, I don't know.

1110
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,420
Maybe.

1111
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,260
We're gonna have to set that number at a certain point.

1112
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,100
Let's see what.

1113
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,540
Life finds a way.

1114
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,380
Yeah.

1115
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,620
We gotta pick a stormy night in Los Angeles too.

1116
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,140
Oh no, it's storming tonight.

1117
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,580
Can we just do it tonight?

1118
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,420
Oh God.

1119
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,460
I'll announce this on the show tonight on Twitch tonight.

1120
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,660
Jesus Christ.

1121
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,060
But I have to learn how to do a seance first.

1122
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,900
I need to do some sort of prep.

1123
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,740
Yeah, whatever.

1124
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,420
I'm sure it's very complicated

1125
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,220
and requires months worth of prep.

1126
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,780
Requires 18 months of prep, by which point,

1127
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,900
you know, we'll hopefully be done with this whole thing.

1128
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,220
Okay, well it's possible.

1129
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,820
It's also possible I have nothing else to do,

1130
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,700
so I will learn it very fast.

1131
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,420
And then you're just like sending spirits

1132
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,540
into bodies all over the city.

1133
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,980
Yeah, that'd be cool as shit.

1134
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,820
Mike became a witch.

1135
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,820
It just took like being in his apartment

1136
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,260
for a week and a half.

1137
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,460
Whoa, I thought Mike became a dryad, is that wrong?

1138
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,860
No, a dru, he's a dru.

1139
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,460
A dru, a dru.

1140
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,060
He's not a dryad, he's a dru.

1141
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,860
Witches are not drues.

1142
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,340
Dryad, drues are not dryads.

1143
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,980
Basin is now Sanuk.

1144
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,220
Basin is now Sanuk.

1145
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,100
So that's exciting.

1146
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,900
All right, well, I guess, dear God,

1147
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,260
let me pray for the vaccine, pray for the vaccine.

1148
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,300
Okay, does that cover Ernie?

1149
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,260
Should we talk about Ernie's friends?

1150
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,100
How do you guys feel about new,

1151
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,740
Ernie is kind of smooth, he's kind of CG smooth right now.

1152
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,940
How do you guys feel about that?

1153
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,300
I don't care for it.

1154
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,500
I don't feel good about it.

1155
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,380
I think it confuses the age, it muddies it.

1156
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,140
Yeah, I think he's kind of less friendly, less jolly.

1157
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,500
It looks like he had work done too.

1158
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
Yeah, kind of does.

1159
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,860
It looks like he had some plastic surgery.

1160
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,060
He looks younger.

1161
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:19,660
I like him being kind of a Tom Bosley-esque figure.

1162
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,020
For sure.

1163
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,820
Yeah, be proud of the wrinkles, too you are.

1164
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,660
Yeah.

1165
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,860
Did we talk about, he was not the original,

1166
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,340
it was JJ?

1167
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,140
Yeah, I think there was another guy.

1168
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,780
Or who was the original leader?

1169
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:39,780
It was not Ernie, JJ Keebler, yeah, in 1969.

1170
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,980
JJ Keebler.

1171
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,180
He was the original head elf.

1172
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,860
And he looked like FDR or something.

1173
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,660
He had a much different look.

1174
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,660
He looked like kind of a...

1175
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,500
Very square.

1176
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,340
Very square.

1177
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,820
Yeah, he was not kind of as like cute of a cartoon.

1178
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,940
He was almost like a caricature of like

1179
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,340
some like captain of industry or something.

1180
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,300
Yeah.

1181
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,140
But then wait a minute,

1182
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,900
but then isn't one of the nephews JJ?

1183
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,180
Yes, I believe so.

1184
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,380
That's confusing.

1185
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,220
It is.

1186
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,740
That's probably a little nod.

1187
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,700
Yeah, but JJ, the original JJ is not around now.

1188
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,780
Yeah, yeah, so they can die.

1189
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,140
Well, or retire.

1190
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,060
Yeah.

1191
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,060
Or maybe JJ is working in a different capacity at Kellogg.

1192
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,500
Oh, he's corporate now.

1193
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,620
Yeah, he's just not a spokesman anymore, a spokes elf.

1194
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,220
Sure, sure.

1195
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,780
So yeah, he works in the corporate office

1196
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,500
and he does paperwork.

1197
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,340
He has to like jump on all the keys

1198
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,500
of his computer one at a time.

1199
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,780
Right, but he gets it done.

1200
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,820
Yeah, yeah, eventually.

1201
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,260
Yeah, and he has more fun than we do,

1202
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,620
just pecking with our fingers.

1203
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,940
Yeah, jumping on a giant keyboard is awesome.

1204
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,820
That sounds pretty great.

1205
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:00,340
Well, that's what Rob Dyrdek got to do

1206
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,420
on every episode of Ridiculousness.

1207
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,500
Of course.

1208
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,580
Who could forget?

1209
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,020
He had as much fun as a keyboard elf.

1210
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:10,860
Yeah.

1211
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,660
Our Carson.

1212
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,220
Our Johnny Carson, the most charismatic host.

1213
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,340
I think that's really where,

1214
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,500
that's why all the shows are shutting down

1215
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,180
and there is no like united voice during this crisis.

1216
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,500
And yeah, we need Dyrdek to weigh in

1217
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:34,500
and say like, man, this coronavirus is crazy, y'all.

1218
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,140
That was a big client at the old post house

1219
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,020
I used to work at.

1220
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,300
So not only was I running tapes for Ridiculousness

1221
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,980
up and downstairs all day,

1222
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,060
it was in six different languages, I believe.

1223
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,020
Wow. Oh my God.

1224
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,220
So there were foreign,

1225
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,860
like there's like somebody out there

1226
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,820
is the French voice of Rob Dyrdek.

1227
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,660
Oh yeah.

1228
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,340
And like people would get in trouble

1229
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,220
because it's like, no, Latin American Spanish

1230
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,900
is different than Castilian Spanish.

1231
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,900
Guys, we gotta get this right.

1232
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,900
Very important.

1233
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,460
Yeah.

1234
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,140
French Rob Dyrdek just would play clips

1235
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,420
and then say, Sacre bleu.

1236
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,900
It's like Lumiere.

1237
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,820
Yeah.

1238
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,420
So JJ retired,

1239
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,620
JJ had the same voice as Fred Flintstone,

1240
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,700
Alan Reed senior.

1241
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,900
But he's not, they aren't related, I don't believe.

1242
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,980
Ernie and JJ?

1243
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,940
JJ, yeah.

1244
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,980
I don't think so.

1245
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,860
There's not a familial relation.

1246
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,540
I don't think so.

1247
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,700
I didn't come across that.

1248
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,260
But he does have a mom, the mom is Ma.

1249
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,100
Right.

1250
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,980
Yeah.

1251
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,820
She doesn't really have,

1252
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,940
she's kind of just like all the Ma,

1253
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,700
she's like granny in Looney Tunes.

1254
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,620
She does not much going on character wise with her.

1255
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,460
Yeah.

1256
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,420
Yeah, there's not too,

1257
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,900
yeah, they should really, Ma should have more to do.

1258
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,740
I agree.

1259
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,180
If that's what you're saying, I agree.

1260
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,300
Yeah, yeah.

1261
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,540
I'm gonna go through this advertising week 360 list

1262
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,340
where they have them alphabetical.

1263
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,100
And this is just, you know,

1264
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,260
I think this is gonna be educational for everybody

1265
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,220
to just like, let's take this downtime

1266
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,860
and get educated on who each of them are, their hair color.

1267
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,340
So that when we're watching compilations,

1268
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,860
we don't get mixed up again.

1269
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,420
Let's learn this once and for all

1270
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,540
and know who every one of these characters is.

1271
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,820
I agree.

1272
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,980
Yeah.

1273
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,260
No more confusion.

1274
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,380
Elmer is the apprentice.

1275
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,660
He's the freckly one with kind of a big swirl of red hair.

1276
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,380
And he know that he's the apprentice

1277
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,860
because he wears the smaller style apprentice hat.

1278
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,860
It's not a big puffy chef's hat.

1279
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,580
So he's just learning.

1280
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,580
Right, so that's how, yeah,

1281
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,340
that's how you make the distinction between the like,

1282
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,340
professionals and the people that are learning

1283
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,820
is the hat size.

1284
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1285
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,180
Buckets, however, is an established chef.

1286
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,100
Buckets reminds me, I'm looking at Buckets right now.

1287
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,260
He reminds me a little bit of Jeff Garland.

1288
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,300
Okay, I could see what you're saying.

1289
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,300
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, a little similarity there.

1290
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,260
The thing I say is somebody calls him the muscle

1291
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,380
in one of the things I read.

1292
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,300
Yes, because he adds so much fudge to the cookie.

1293
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,180
A Buckets worth of fudge.

1294
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,580
So he's doing the most heavy lifting.

1295
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,140
Uh-huh, I like Buckets.

1296
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,700
Yeah, I like this guy. I like Buckets too.

1297
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,380
Well, we all reap the rewards of what Buckets does for us.

1298
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,220
Mm-hmm.

1299
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,540
Fast Eddie. Oh yeah.

1300
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,300
An elf of few words, just ask him to bake anything.

1301
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,980
And before the sentence gets out of your mouth,

1302
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,620
he's already off doing it.

1303
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,060
He also has red hair.

1304
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,180
It's a little confusing,

1305
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,180
but he's like twice the size of Elmer.

1306
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,700
And he has the real big hat.

1307
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,180
Yes, yes, not an apprentice hat.

1308
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:34,180
I think these three and Ernie map pretty well

1309
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:39,540
to the main members of the DeMeo crime family

1310
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,580
and the Sopranos.

1311
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,500
I think Ernie is clearly Tony.

1312
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,100
Elmer is Christopher.

1313
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,180
Buckets I think is Polly Walnuts.

1314
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:53,300
And I think the Fast Eddie is Silvio because-

1315
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,780
I would switch those around, I think.

1316
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,980
You think, but I think Silvio is more,

1317
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,620
I think Silvio is more reliable.

1318
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,740
Do you think Buckets is more reliable

1319
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,580
and trustworthy than Fast Eddie?

1320
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,660
I think Fast Eddie though goes so fast.

1321
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,700
He's, they're both reliable,

1322
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,340
but I think Buckets is steadier than Fast Eddie

1323
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,660
because Fast Eddie is impulsive.

1324
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,620
Yeah, then that's what you think of with Polly.

1325
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,420
So yeah, that's right.

1326
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,020
Polly a little more explosive.

1327
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,220
Silvio is much more like measured in general.

1328
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,260
Yeah, I would agree with that.

1329
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,220
Okay, so now that we're glad we squared that away.

1330
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,700
Yeah.

1331
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,620
But they're all important.

1332
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,580
You couldn't do any of this without them.

1333
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,940
They're all crucial members at the same time.

1334
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,780
Yes, yes, yes.

1335
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,060
They're crucial.

1336
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,860
The next one on the list, I feel like less so.

1337
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,860
Roger?

1338
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,340
Roger, something about Roger, I don't know.

1339
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,540
I'm getting a bad feeling.

1340
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,100
I think he is, I think he is Ralph Zafforetto.

1341
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,820
I think he is Joe Pantaleato's unhinged character.

1342
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,020
What don't you like about Roger?

1343
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,420
I don't know, I just get a weird vibe from him.

1344
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,100
Maybe it's the green.

1345
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,740
There's a shiftiness to him.

1346
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,020
I think he looks nice though.

1347
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,340
I was thinking he looks a little bit like Sam Waterston.

1348
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,460
I can see that.

1349
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,300
Yeah, I see that.

1350
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,140
That's fair.

1351
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,060
He's a nice guy.

1352
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,060
He's a climate change fighter.

1353
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,500
If Roger's anything like Sam.

1354
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,820
And he's, look, he's been around forever.

1355
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,900
I don't know, what a type of a boss is Ernie?

1356
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,940
Is Ernie somebody who's gonna keep people around

1357
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,060
just because of like loyalty?

1358
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,900
Or will he give somebody the axe

1359
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,300
if they're not pulling their weight?

1360
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,020
I feel like he's gonna give people the axe.

1361
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,340
He's nice.

1362
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,420
He's, what's his nickname again?

1363
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,500
Mr.

1364
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,900
Mr. Sincerity.

1365
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,060
Mr. Sincerity.

1366
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,180
But obviously-

1367
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,900
It's better to tell it like it is.

1368
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,260
Yeah, he has to tell it like it is.

1369
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,340
So I feel like he wouldn't maybe keep Roger around

1370
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,540
unless he was valuable to the team.

1371
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:03,540
I'm the most confused by Roger's role.

1372
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,380
Yeah.

1373
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:06,900
Something describes him,

1374
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,740
the Wikipedia describes him as the jeweler.

1375
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,540
What do you mean the jeweler?

1376
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,380
Yeah, what does that?

1377
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,620
Is that like putting in the rainbow chocolate chips

1378
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,180
for the rainbow cookies?

1379
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,540
Yeah.

1380
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,300
Rainbow chips deluxe, another goat, another great cookie.

1381
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,580
Oh, rainbow chips deluxe.

1382
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,300
Oh, I loved rainbow chips deluxe.

1383
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1384
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,420
So exciting.

1385
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,380
So if Roger is jeweling them-

1386
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,140
Yes, he's jeweling the cookies.

1387
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,020
With chips, then we gotta be, we gotta like this guy.

1388
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:38,860
We gotta like him.

1389
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,700
Maybe that breaks the Sopranos metaphor.

1390
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:46,700
Maybe he's more like Adam Sandler in Uncut Chips.

1391
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,740
These are real chocolate chips.

1392
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,580
Ernie.

1393
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,700
Yeah, we got the green and the yellow.

1394
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:04,380
Ernie, I need you to just hold onto these chips for a week.

1395
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,060
Just hold on, give me 20%.

1396
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,340
I'll give you 20% when I pick it up.

1397
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,300
Now we got the spring colors.

1398
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,140
We got the different colors for Easter.

1399
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,100
The Easter colors were so lovely, I have to say.

1400
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,940
I agree.

1401
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,780
You gotta bring those back.

1402
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,220
These cookies have enough chips already.

1403
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,940
They're deluxe enough as they are.

1404
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,620
I disagree, I disagree.

1405
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,740
I don't think I see them in this list,

1406
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,460
but I wanna make sure we hit everybody.

1407
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,460
I'm also seeing Sam the peanut butter baker.

1408
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,620
Oh, I miss Sam the peanut butter baker.

1409
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,460
Yeah.

1410
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,500
That's in the Wikipedia.

1411
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,820
There's some lists that claim to be exhaustive

1412
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,380
that I don't think are.

1413
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,220
Right.

1414
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,500
In fact, the list I was just looking at

1415
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,620
didn't explain that Fast Eddie wraps the products,

1416
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,420
which I think we mentioned in our previous episode.

1417
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,420
That's a vital role.

1418
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,420
Yes. Extremely.

1419
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,140
Yeah, that's the whole production line.

1420
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,380
Did you come across Leonardo?

1421
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,140
Yes, yeah.

1422
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,260
Leonardo's the next in the list I'm looking at.

1423
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,260
Yeah, and Leonardo factors into the recent CGI ads.

1424
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,500
They've still been using him recently.

1425
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,340
Right.

1426
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:19,540
And he is the paint, he paints.

1427
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,020
Yes.

1428
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,180
And he's got a big beret and a paintbrush.

1429
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,580
And you gotta say he's a little bit similar to,

1430
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,180
from the Duffy Gang, Jelatoni.

1431
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,180
Jelatoni, of course.

1432
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,780
First thing I thought of.

1433
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,340
Yeah.

1434
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,060
So it would stand to reason then

1435
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,700
that also Leonardo fucks.

1436
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,820
Nice.

1437
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,500
I think 100%, you can say it, Leonardo fucks.

1438
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,820
Yeah, yeah.

1439
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,180
Sorry, parents.

1440
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,500
We'll start switching to tarnation

1441
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,820
as soon as we adjust to it.

1442
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,780
Then we got- Next up.

1443
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,140
Are you gonna say Doc?

1444
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,620
You should say, yeah, you say Doc.

1445
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,180
Doc is the character's name.

1446
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:01,980
Wow.

1447
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:03,820
Yes.

1448
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:08,100
Who adds a sprinkling of wisdom into every creation

1449
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,380
he makes in the big, what does that mean?

1450
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,220
Wisdom.

1451
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,660
I don't know.

1452
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,780
That seems inessential.

1453
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,620
If there's any weak link on the team, I think it's Doc.

1454
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:22,740
Yeah, although now I'm cross-checking with the Wikipedia

1455
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,220
and he's described as the doctor.

1456
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:30,300
And then they're extremely crucial these days, obviously.

1457
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,620
So maybe they can't get rid of Doc.

1458
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,260
He's a dual role guy.

1459
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,900
But why is he dressed up as a baker then?

1460
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,260
Shouldn't he have like a stethoscope?

1461
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,540
No, well, he's the doctor and cookie maker.

1462
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,780
Which now, now that sort of bugs me about Ernie

1463
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,700
if he's making people double up on jobs.

1464
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:53,180
Right, maybe Ernie isn't as good as we think he is.

1465
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,340
Seems possible.

1466
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,900
Might be sort of a tyrant the way we discovered

1467
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,700
Tony Solaroni is.

1468
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:01,580
Right.

1469
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,900
You gotta have some amount of distrust

1470
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,900
for before the owner who really controls the press

1471
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,020
who puts out these press releases,

1472
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,420
who represents the company in media.

1473
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,100
So it's all kind of slanted to him

1474
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,900
and to make him look like a real hero.

1475
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,180
Yeah, that's a good point.

1476
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:24,100
So yeah, who knows what, yeah, we should do some,

1477
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,820
we really need to figure out if Doc is being mistreated

1478
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,340
at the tree, at the factory.

1479
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,460
Mm-hmm.

1480
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,060
Cause it's possible.

1481
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:35,940
I mean, a number of elderly employees.

1482
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,780
Yes, yes.

1483
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,940
And so does that make you question

1484
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,980
whether there are robust enough retirement plans

1485
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,060
at this factory or do these people just have to,

1486
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,660
you know, work their fingers to the bone?

1487
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,580
Yeah, it's like Ernie a Bezos, is he a Jeff Bezos type?

1488
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,860
Is he somebody who underpays the employees

1489
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,460
and has gotten rich off their backs?

1490
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,500
It's possible.

1491
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,700
Maybe so, doesn't give them bathroom breaks.

1492
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,140
Just asking, also, I'm just asking questions.

1493
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,740
Just asking questions.

1494
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,100
That's all I'm doing.

1495
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,060
A phrase you're always happy to see.

1496
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:11,100
Like it's always good vibes when you see that phrase.

1497
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,940
Mm-hmm.

1498
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,420
I'm a skeptic, that's a cool thing to be, right?

1499
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,500
A skeptic. Oh yeah,

1500
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,180
professional skeptic, hell yeah.

1501
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,220
No vibes there.

1502
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:26,180
We got Sam, oh wait, oh, sorry,

1503
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,180
I said Sam, Sam is the peanut butter baker,

1504
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,740
which again, this list does not say.

1505
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,460
I've become disappointed as we've gone

1506
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,500
by the advertising week 360 list,

1507
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,900
but there are nice helpful pictures, so I'll give it that.

1508
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,620
Well, Sam was in the Weedables commercial.

1509
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:44,020
Weedables, another food we had a lot in the house growing up.

1510
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,860
I think I had two.

1511
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,060
I think we had a two.

1512
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,140
Yeah, they made like a lot of not just cookies,

1513
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,980
they had club crackers, they had the pizza.

1514
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,380
Always had club crackers.

1515
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,980
Club crackers great with soup.

1516
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,500
Pick up a box folks, if you're stocking up on canned goods

1517
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,300
when you're at the store, club crackers, delicious.

1518
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,900
Do you have some? Very buttery.

1519
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,220
I don't have some.

1520
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:09,620
Those though, I feel like, well they come in sleeves,

1521
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,580
but once you open a sleeve, I feel like the clock

1522
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,780
is ticking on those club crackers.

1523
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,380
Like they're gonna lose their crunch quick.

1524
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,140
Their essence?

1525
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,180
Their essence, their crunchy essence.

1526
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,860
Can I bring up some of the other products

1527
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:27,420
that in their product line, which there are,

1528
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,740
elf starring commercials and you guys might have run

1529
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,580
into these.

1530
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,980
I think it makes sense that today we don't see on shelves

1531
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,380
a product called Oh Boyzies,

1532
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:45,100
which is sort of a double, it's to get oh boy,

1533
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,020
because they'll have you saying oh boy,

1534
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,340
but they're also potato chips and it's meant to be

1535
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,380
it's meant to, the Boyzies is meant to make you think

1536
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,300
of Idaho and Idaho potatoes.

1537
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,340
Right.

1538
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,540
Weird name.

1539
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,500
Very strange name.

1540
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,380
I never had those.

1541
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:07,380
And I was not dying to eat their line of tortilla chips

1542
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:12,180
called Chachos with a weird cinnamon flavor

1543
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,140
called Cinnamon Crespagna.

1544
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:19,260
I think Crespagna is potentially a fictional,

1545
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:22,740
I could be wrong, I didn't look it up in any

1546
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:23,580
Spanish dictionary.

1547
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:27,740
The Nina, the Pinta, the Crespagna, the three ships.

1548
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,380
Columbus, the New World.

1549
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,540
Such early education stuff.

1550
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,940
Also educational was the Chachos ad where I learned

1551
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,380
how they make the chips, which is that all the elves

1552
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,980
gather in a circle and throw a tortilla up in the air

1553
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,980
three or four times and then somebody,

1554
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:49,740
one of the elves cracks the whip, cracks a big whip

1555
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,420
right in the center which splits it into many different

1556
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,260
chips.

1557
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,300
Like Indiana Jones?

1558
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,700
Yeah, yeah.

1559
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,540
It's a big old crack and if you don't do it right

1560
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,340
in the center, I bet that's a problem.

1561
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,060
That's a very special kitchen skill.

1562
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,780
Sounds efficient.

1563
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,140
Which elf cracked the whip?

1564
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,540
He was very far away in a pretty poor quality

1565
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,660
YouTube transfer so it's hard to see, I'll pull it up

1566
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,620
while we're talking, I'll see if I can, this will be

1567
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:20,420
a good test, can I identify after this lesson

1568
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,500
which elf it was?

1569
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,940
Yes, that's good.

1570
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:28,860
What other, I was looking at the list too of items.

1571
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:32,100
There's a lot of stuff I forgot from the 90s that they had

1572
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,580
that we had in the house, like cookie wise.

1573
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,020
Jason, did you go through this list too?

1574
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,580
No, send it to me.

1575
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,860
I looked at a couple lists, yeah.

1576
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:48,220
But if you wanna go ahead, hold on, yeah, let me,

1577
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,420
now I'm losing my list here.

1578
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:55,540
I think that, I'm now looking at the Chachos commercial

1579
01:09:55,540 --> 01:10:00,020
and I think this might be a lot of one time,

1580
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,740
one use only Hispanic elves.

1581
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,500
Oh, interesting.

1582
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,980
Yeah, I think.

1583
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,060
They're all in sombreros so I think these are not

1584
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,140
the typical, these are not the people we've been covering.

1585
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:15,980
Right.

1586
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,660
So we had the, oh man.

1587
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,540
Now I'm just, now it keeps pulling up dry ads on my phone.

1588
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,580
All right, here we go.

1589
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:33,860
They had Keebler Fudge Shop cookies, which I remember.

1590
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,060
They had, now Rich and Chips used to be their like

1591
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,380
chocolate chip cookie.

1592
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,500
Which would just have like a lot of chocolate chips

1593
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,620
and it was just Rich and Chips with like an N, not an and.

1594
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,100
Well, in the midnight there was Chocolate Lovers.

1595
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,660
I think that was a variant of Chips Deluxe.

1596
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,620
Right.

1597
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,860
I watched a 1995 commercial on that

1598
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,740
where Ernie rings a woman's doorbell

1599
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,540
and asks, do you like chocolate?

1600
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,980
And she goes, honey, I live for it.

1601
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,820
Um, that's fun.

1602
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,340
Let's not forget to give some love

1603
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,260
to Zesta Salteen Crackers.

1604
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,340
Of course.

1605
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:26,340
I don't know which elf works primarily on Zesta.

1606
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,620
Zesta, yeah, I don't think it says.

1607
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,460
The, there was, did you get,

1608
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,900
oh wait, we still have more elves, right?

1609
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,740
There's like two or three elves left.

1610
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:36,980
Well, there's two left.

1611
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,940
There's Elwood, the teenage elf.

1612
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,900
Who's different than Zoot and JJ.

1613
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,660
Yes. Right.

1614
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,260
Elwood looks a little squirrely to me,

1615
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,220
so he would be Jackie Jr.

1616
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,220
He's the one who holds up the card game

1617
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,340
and then Vito kills.

1618
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,940
And then Florence, Florence I feel like

1619
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,540
does not get enough screen time.

1620
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,420
Well, right.

1621
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,420
All the elves are white except for Florence, who is black.

1622
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,260
Yes.

1623
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,940
And I have never seen a commercial with Florence.

1624
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,740
She is, she's wearing shoes with heels

1625
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,820
and maybe she's the one who puts the little like,

1626
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:19,780
she steps all the holes into the Zesta crackers.

1627
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,220
Oh, yes.

1628
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,660
Look, you've already given her more of a backstory

1629
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,260
than the people at Keibler have.

1630
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,580
So you've actually paid more attention to her

1631
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,860
than they have.

1632
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,700
Yeah, yeah.

1633
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,860
It's a good job.

1634
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,900
You're getting your steps in.

1635
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,020
It's, you're on your feet.

1636
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,260
There really should, look,

1637
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,580
there's room for a lot of new Keibler elves.

1638
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,620
And I feel like let's up the diversity.

1639
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,020
That's what I'm saying.

1640
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,020
Yeah. Yeah.

1641
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,340
Let's bring back the Chachos characters

1642
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,900
who apparently were only used for Chachos.

1643
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,740
Yes, that feels-

1644
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,420
Gave them to temporary, temporarily employed.

1645
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,940
But they're all, as we know, they're immortal.

1646
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,180
So they're running around somewhere.

1647
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,620
So bring them back, Ernie.

1648
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,420
Yeah. Come on, Ernie.

1649
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,380
You know what? I don't like Ernie now.

1650
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,100
Uh-oh. Hey.

1651
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,340
I'm sorry, Jason.

1652
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,860
Sounds like you're fake.

1653
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,580
Are you a fake friend, Michael?

1654
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:13,140
Turning on Ernie this hard, this fast?

1655
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:13,980
I don't know.

1656
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,860
I'm just saying a couple of things

1657
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,580
have added up in this discussion.

1658
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:17,740
And I think maybe,

1659
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,580
maybe Ernie's not the guy we think he is.

1660
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,060
That's all I'm saying.

1661
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,060
This is the kind of rage

1662
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,460
that only someone on drugs would have.

1663
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,580
Do you need me to come over there and break your neck?

1664
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,100
I'll be, all right, I'll be honest with you.

1665
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:29,940
I am on drugs

1666
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,460
and I would really like you to come over here

1667
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,300
and break my neck.

1668
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,340
It's the only cure as we've figured out.

1669
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,140
We're gonna have to, we're all, all right.

1670
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,140
I know gloves are hard to come by right now,

1671
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,140
but we're all gonna have to buy some gloves

1672
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,780
so we can visit each other's homes

1673
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:45,220
and break each other's necks.

1674
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,380
There are, like our telephone booths,

1675
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,740
I think in South Korea for testing for the virus,

1676
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,220
where it has like kind of holes and like those,

1677
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,380
you know how like when you're handling

1678
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,220
nuclear material in a movie or TV show,

1679
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,900
those gloves that kind of go through,

1680
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,140
like that's the protective way that you can touch it.

1681
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,140
Yeah, yeah.

1682
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,940
I'll build something like that in my window by my kitchen

1683
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,100
and you can just put your hands through the gloves

1684
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,980
and then break my neck that way.

1685
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,620
It'll be very easy.

1686
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,420
So we'll pass, and the kitchen counter

1687
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:25,100
is probably where you're doing your snorting.

1688
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,420
It's a nice clear surface.

1689
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,780
So I'll walk up, I'll do a spot check on you,

1690
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,340
see if you're doing a snort, and then I'll reach,

1691
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,100
yeah, you'll feel some gloves on your neck

1692
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,540
and that'll be me saving your life by breaking your neck.

1693
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,740
And I'll say, thank you, sir.

1694
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,420
And then you'll be on to the next neck breaking

1695
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,780
that you're scheduled for.

1696
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:49,020
Oh, wow, South Korea thinks it's so great.

1697
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,020
They've got testing booths.

1698
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,900
Can they get Trolls World 2 on demand real quick?

1699
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,340
You tell them, Jason.

1700
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,460
That's American.

1701
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,340
We might be low on testing kits,

1702
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:08,300
but we stocked every home with the movie Lovebirds

1703
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,820
on Netflix.

1704
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,980
We have Lovebirds and we created the Keibler elves.

1705
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,180
This is America.

1706
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,900
What was the phrase about American in America in the,

1707
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,420
Jason, you read it, right?

1708
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,660
The way, well, the elves, they're uniquely,

1709
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,980
they're an American strain.

1710
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,940
Oh yeah, that's right, sorry, they're an American strain.

1711
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:32,340
Non-drews, they're a uniquely American strain.

1712
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:36,460
And a uniquely American strain of cure

1713
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:41,460
is immediate release of Lovebirds and cats and Frozen 2.

1714
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,100
And Invisible Man.

1715
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,980
The man who was, they were just keeping these movies

1716
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,740
arbitrarily from us.

1717
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:57,380
And when duty called, Hollywood acted.

1718
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,780
Now toilet paper, not so much.

1719
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,100
Not so much.

1720
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:07,820
But our ironic cat's viewings can flow forth.

1721
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,140
Well, now I'm depressed.

1722
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,500
Now I'm depressed. Oh no.

1723
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,460
Well.

1724
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,620
Well then we gotta think of something fun.

1725
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,860
I came off the high of the Chukko seance

1726
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,260
and now I'm sad again.

1727
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,220
So there's kind of the more like one-off elves.

1728
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,900
There's micro Keibler.

1729
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,260
He was the elf who would shrink cookies down

1730
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,980
to like when they had the little sized cookies.

1731
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,140
Oh.

1732
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,260
There was a professor, there was very clearly

1733
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,180
an Albert Einstein kind of elf.

1734
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:39,780
And then my favorite of the people who show up

1735
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:44,540
to bother the elves is the cop who arrests,

1736
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,500
I believe it's Buckets.

1737
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,500
And the cop says, he's not the front man

1738
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,700
for a fudge smuggling operation.

1739
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,420
And Ernie says, no sir, he's our middle man.

1740
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,900
And that's a cute joke.

1741
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,380
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1742
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,420
Well, that's very good.

1743
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,180
I however am the front man

1744
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,340
for a fudge smuggling operation.

1745
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,180
So.

1746
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:09,460
You're proud to admit it.

1747
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,300
That's the point.

1748
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,700
Yeah.

1749
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:16,300
Yeah, Friar Tuck who was mainly promoting Munchums.

1750
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,420
As he said, Zoot and JJ were, you know,

1751
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:22,660
excited about pizzerias, pizza chips.

1752
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,540
They didn't make them, but they were,

1753
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,500
they're Ernie's nephews.

1754
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,980
And if Zoot, if, you know,

1755
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:32,180
nephews who are so judgy and opinionated,

1756
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,340
if they like pizzerias, why wouldn't everyone?

1757
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:36,660
Yeah.

1758
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,420
Zach, the fudge shop supervisor.

1759
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,460
Flo, wait, is Flo the one we were talking about?

1760
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,580
Florence, yeah.

1761
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:47,180
Yes, oh, here wait, I found her job on Wikipedia.

1762
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,420
She's the accountant.

1763
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:52,260
Boo, boo to this, boring.

1764
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,100
Yeah.

1765
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,060
Give her something, in a fudge factory,

1766
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,900
she's just like working on a calculator.

1767
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,940
Give her something fun to do.

1768
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,780
Give her something fun.

1769
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,460
Let her drive the fudge submarine.

1770
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,500
Yeah, I agree.

1771
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,500
And do we, oh, Elwood, I don't think we said

1772
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,140
runs through the dough.

1773
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,100
Right.

1774
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,100
And then I don't really know

1775
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,700
what's up with Larry and Art.

1776
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,900
I got no info on Larry and Art.

1777
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,020
I don't either, yeah.

1778
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:19,940
Yeah.

1779
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,140
No qualities, did they have?

1780
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,380
Larry and Art, what commercial were they in?

1781
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,140
It doesn't say what I'm looking at.

1782
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:31,860
Who were the guys in the pizzerias commercial?

1783
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,460
Are those the regular elves?

1784
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,540
That's, they're the nephews.

1785
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,580
Okay, that's JJ and?

1786
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,580
JJ and Zoot.

1787
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,260
Zoot, Zoot, yeah, yeah.

1788
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,100
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1789
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:47,020
But, you know, that's not the end of the mythology

1790
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,980
because we got to the end of these characters.

1791
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,260
You know, I was thinking how, you know,

1792
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:55,660
I mean, the second gaze where we talk about things

1793
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,980
that aren't necessarily super on themed experience topic,

1794
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,300
and I was like, well, this is a little outside

1795
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,340
of the confines of what we usually do,

1796
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,660
but then I realized it is not, and I'll tell you why,

1797
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,420
because several years ago,

1798
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,420
there was a factory pop-up experience in New York City.

1799
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,500
There has been a themed experience

1800
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,140
based around the Keebler factory tree.

1801
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,220
Wow, I didn't know, I didn't see that.

1802
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:26,260
Yeah, it was done for the sacred holiday

1803
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:31,260
of National Fudge Day, which let's never forget it again.

1804
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,620
It's June 16th, which happens to be my mom's birthday.

1805
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,660
Wow. I had no idea all these years

1806
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,580
my mom was born on National Fudge Day.

1807
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,860
Wow, National Fudge, wow.

1808
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,500
Yeah, I'm so lucky. Do we know any other

1809
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,540
prominent Americans who were born on National Fudge Day?

1810
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,340
Ooh, that's a good question, I'll look that up.

1811
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,580
Yeah, what's 16th?

1812
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,340
16th. Celebrity birthdays.

1813
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,660
Celebrity.

1814
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,980
Tupac, y'all. Wow.

1815
01:19:58,980 --> 01:19:59,820
Wow.

1816
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,740
Wow. Born on National Fudge Day.

1817
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:11,820
Roe, isn't there, his book is something about,

1818
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:14,220
oh, the rose that grew from concrete.

1819
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,820
Why, the title should have been the rose

1820
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,180
that grew from concrete on National Fudge Day.

1821
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,660
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1822
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,220
Wow, he might be the most famous,

1823
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,740
oh, wait a minute, the ultimate warrior,

1824
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,700
I believe, was born.

1825
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,940
Let me make sure that that's right before.

1826
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:40,380
Surprise National Fudge Day is in a warmer month,

1827
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,500
because, I mean, if you're not careful with that fudge,

1828
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,060
you're gonna end up with your own fudge spring,

1829
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,740
inadvertently. Yeah.

1830
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,580
Yeah, ultimate warrior.

1831
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:53,100
Ultimate warrior, born June 16th,

1832
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,700
professional wrestler and noted racist.

1833
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,020
Oh man, there's a lot of good ones.

1834
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,460
OJ getaway driver, Al Cowlings.

1835
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,540
Wow, really?

1836
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,380
Yeah.

1837
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,180
Wow.

1838
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:10,660
Geronimo was born on National Fudge.

1839
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,820
Really?

1840
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,940
Yeah, this is quite a day.

1841
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:15,500
I wonder if my mom knew about any of these.

1842
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,900
Phil Mickelson, one of the greatest golfers of all time.

1843
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,620
You're gonna text your mom,

1844
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,940
did you know you were born on the same day

1845
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:23,340
as the ultimate warrior?

1846
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,660
No, you're saying that assuming that my mom texts.

1847
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,500
Oh, fair enough, fair enough.

1848
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,700
That's a big leap that you were wrong on.

1849
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:38,980
Send her a letter that says she was born.

1850
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,660
The primary communication, yes.

1851
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:45,660
Oh man.

1852
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,580
So yeah, wish all these people

1853
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,380
happy National Fudge days slash birthdays next time around.

1854
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:54,180
But let's talk about the themed experience,

1855
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,660
because the themed experience fleshed out a lot of stuff.

1856
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,420
And I think this is where Jason,

1857
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:01,860
some of the expanded the logistics of the factory,

1858
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:05,580
I think were made especially clear by this event.

1859
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,500
That being the really important piece of knowledge

1860
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,300
about the factory that the tree was built on top

1861
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,900
of a flowing fudge river called the fudge terrain in spring.

1862
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,340
Whoa.

1863
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,900
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1864
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:21,620
And I don't think they knew it always.

1865
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,340
That's what the story seems to tell that they were like,

1866
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,140
maybe they were running out of fudge or something.

1867
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,260
And then they like, you know,

1868
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,580
dug a shovel in or something.

1869
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,700
They were like building a new wing of the factory.

1870
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,940
It's like a Beverly hillbilly set up

1871
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,300
where they're in their holler and then they strike it,

1872
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,180
strike it rich because they find oil.

1873
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,340
Brown gold.

1874
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,340
Brown gold.

1875
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,100
Brown fudgey gold.

1876
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,380
Elfin tea.

1877
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,340
They also, they have a magic oven.

1878
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,940
I'm a little unclear on what,

1879
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,820
how it works and why it's magic.

1880
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,220
And there's also, Jason, you alluded to it,

1881
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,900
the rainbow cannon.

1882
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,740
Yeah.

1883
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,780
The rainbow cannon,

1884
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,460
when Ernie calls the team,

1885
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:10,500
when a non-believer in elves has been spotted.

1886
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,380
And when that happens, the rainbow cannon is fired up

1887
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,380
to send an insta rainbow in that person's direction

1888
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,660
to sway their minds and make them believe.

1889
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,860
It's sort of a back signal.

1890
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,900
Only in America do we gotta change this guy's mind.

1891
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,980
Get the gun.

1892
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,020
Shoot it in the air.

1893
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,660
Shoot it in the air above him.

1894
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,820
Make him dance.

1895
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:39,020
I should say also that, you know,

1896
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,700
all of this was done and the pop-up event was done

1897
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,940
in order to celebrate the release of a new type of cookie,

1898
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:46,940
Keebler Whoopsie fudge stripes cookies.

1899
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:51,900
Usually the cookies just have carefully painted stripes

1900
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:55,700
courtesy of Leonardo, but in the Whoopsie scenario,

1901
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:00,700
it was their first cookie that was covered fully in fudge

1902
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:05,300
or as they put it in a hashtag, hashtag fully fudge.

1903
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,180
Wow.

1904
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:12,540
This was a viral event that really got people talking

1905
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:16,500
three years later on a paywall Patreon.

1906
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,820
That's right.

1907
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,660
They really should.

1908
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,500
Due to disease boredom.

1909
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,340
Right.

1910
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,460
Throw away, us not wanting to waste a good topic

1911
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,900
on a quarantine episode.

1912
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:32,660
That being said, I mean, how long have we been going?

1913
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,380
I mean, this is a media topic.

1914
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,620
There's a ton here.

1915
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:38,700
I, yeah, there really is.

1916
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,060
Yeah, yeah, quite a bit.

1917
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:41,460
And actually, you know, I have a little bit more.

1918
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,620
I mean, I hear this, this might be a good way to end it,

1919
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,780
but I don't want to, you know, cut you guys off.

1920
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:49,140
If there's any important facts you want to share.

1921
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,340
I really, Jason, you go ahead.

1922
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:53,860
Well, I would just want to point out,

1923
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:57,140
like if you are craving like Girl Scout cookies,

1924
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,100
Caramel Delights or Thin Mints and stuff,

1925
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,700
Kepler essentially makes those varieties of cookie year round.

1926
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,380
I don't have the names in front of me,

1927
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,740
but like they basically make them.

1928
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,660
Yeah, you can get versions of the famous cookies.

1929
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:14,500
Yeah.

1930
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,580
Yeah, under different names.

1931
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,180
Or like the generic Kroger, I mean,

1932
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,540
your grocery store likely has the generic version

1933
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,060
of all these cookies.

1934
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:22,900
Sure.

1935
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,700
So.

1936
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,300
I like the tag alongs.

1937
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,060
We're talking Girl Scout cookies,

1938
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,740
the peanut butter patties, tag alongs.

1939
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,860
Those are my favorite.

1940
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,780
Always have been.

1941
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:38,180
You got to dock at points that they aren't being made

1942
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,900
by a little Elfin peanut butter baker.

1943
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,740
Well, of course.

1944
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,020
They don't have a Sam on their side.

1945
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,260
I agree with that.

1946
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,700
Yeah, it's a little more fun.

1947
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,420
Can I do this little segment here,

1948
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,660
perhaps to close this out?

1949
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,700
Of course, yes.

1950
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,620
Well, you know, because there's not a ton

1951
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,980
of Google results for these folks,

1952
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,660
some of the ones that I found ended up being on eBay.

1953
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,460
And it occurred to me, this might be a good opportunity

1954
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,380
to do a quick mini version of our rarely done

1955
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:12,540
this segment, Souvenir Showdown.

1956
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,860
I think it's SmackDown.

1957
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:14,700
SmackFuck.

1958
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,380
That's what happens when you don't ever do it.

1959
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,220
Yeah.

1960
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:26,220
So, because two of these items are so odd,

1961
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:29,380
I just had to have you guys learn about them

1962
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,660
and guess the prices.

1963
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:36,660
So the first one is a lot of 200 vintage Kepler Elf,

1964
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:42,900
Super Elf sail kites from the 1970s.

1965
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:48,740
This is a box that contains 200 kites.

1966
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,780
These were promotional items.

1967
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,620
Wow.

1968
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:56,620
They feature Ernie bursting forth in a Superman fashion.

1969
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,100
It says Super Elf really big.

1970
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:03,940
And then in smaller text, it says,

1971
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,980
who in reality is Ernie Keibler?

1972
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:10,580
Ask him the tough questions.

1973
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,860
Yeah, that's sort of what Mike is getting at.

1974
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,820
Huh, who is Ernie Keibler?

1975
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,820
So how many of these are there again?

1976
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,620
It's, you get a cardboard box and there are 200 inside.

1977
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:22,700
200, wow. Unassembled.

1978
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,140
From the 1970s, at some point in time,

1979
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,780
they were free with a purchase,

1980
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,380
with two packages of Keibler crackers or cookies.

1981
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,660
This one just was never open.

1982
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:35,660
So how much would it cost to get 200 kites?

1983
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,740
Is it a buy now or is it the auction starting price?

1984
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,860
Do you know?

1985
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,540
Oh, I'm seeing it as buy it now.

1986
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,380
Okay.

1987
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:45,380
You can still offer, but they have a buy it now option.

1988
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,660
Right, right.

1989
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:49,260
I'm gonna say they want five grand for that.

1990
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:52,660
Guess I'm wrong.

1991
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,700
I think $50 for that box.

1992
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:01,580
I think you've got the under, that is $219.

1993
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,940
Oh wow. That's not bad.

1994
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,260
That's pretty good.

1995
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,500
I feel like, I mean, the last I saw kites anywhere

1996
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,740
somewhere in a Fry's Electronics,

1997
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,420
some of the products still available there.

1998
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,700
And I'm sure they're letting kites go for $20.

1999
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,300
I don't know the quality of these kites, but I don't know,

2000
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:24,540
200, that's only, that's a dollar and change per kite.

2001
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:25,860
Yeah, that's okay.

2002
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,020
Pretty fair price.

2003
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:30,260
Maybe once this whole thing is over, we'll buy that

2004
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,300
and we'll have a fan event

2005
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,180
where we all fly these kites together.

2006
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:39,180
We end out, let's go fly Kepler Elf kite.

2007
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:45,700
Sounds like a good first way to be outside.

2008
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,900
Yeah.

2009
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,580
Yeah, we'll make sure it's a fan meetup.

2010
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,420
Right.

2011
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,660
Let's not test the waters by just going out

2012
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,980
with four people we like.

2013
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:56,540
Let's bring all of our fans in one place.

2014
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,620
Immediately.

2015
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:02,020
Yes, as soon as, in like, what, two weeks from now, right?

2016
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:02,940
Yeah, two weeks.

2017
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,780
We'll set the date.

2018
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,140
It's gonna be fine.

2019
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,500
Yeah, sorry about it.

2020
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,940
Professional podcasters and their listeners,

2021
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,660
famously in good health.

2022
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,140
Famously sturdy stock.

2023
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,260
All, what?

2024
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:17,660
Super athletic.

2025
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:19,180
Very athletic, yeah.

2026
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,980
Especially the hosts.

2027
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,420
There's podcasts with jacked people.

2028
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,500
Yeah, yes, that's true.

2029
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,900
Yeah, like the dumbbells.

2030
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:27,740
The dumbbells are jacked.

2031
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:28,580
The dumbbells.

2032
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,420
Yeah.

2033
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,580
Riders podcast.

2034
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,180
Major wrestling figures podcast.

2035
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,340
Those guys are jacked.

2036
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,620
Yeah.

2037
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,620
So they'll be out there too with us flying the kite,

2038
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,460
is what I'm saying.

2039
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,820
The dumbbells and rider and Hawkins.

2040
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,300
Beating us up.

2041
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,340
Beating us up and taking our kites.

2042
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:47,580
Breaking our necks.

2043
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,700
Yeah.

2044
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:51,580
Oh, I want them, I want any of them to break my neck.

2045
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,020
Sorry, Scott.

2046
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:53,860
Oh, damn.

2047
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,700
What if you don't do it full,

2048
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,460
like what if you don't fully break my neck?

2049
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,500
What if it's half broken?

2050
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,740
I'll get you part of the way there.

2051
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:01,540
Oh, you mean like if I'm not gonna do it all the way?

2052
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:02,980
Yeah, right.

2053
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,620
You could ensure that your wrestler friend would?

2054
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,540
Yes.

2055
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,300
Yeah, that means just practically.

2056
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,140
That's gonna, what I care about is you kicking drugs

2057
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:13,460
and if that's what it takes, then great.

2058
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,580
That's right.

2059
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,820
There's another good cause that is depicted

2060
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,340
in the second and final item.

2061
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:25,340
It is described as, well, it's a pin

2062
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:29,180
and the pin says, feel the urn, ERN,

2063
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,700
and that refers to Ernie, obviously,

2064
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:35,460
and it is clearly a reference to Bernie Sanders,

2065
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,460
apparently no longer viable presidential candidate

2066
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,820
for some fucking reason.

2067
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:47,180
Bernie Sanders, feel the urn, Keebler Elf presidential pin.

2068
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:50,820
It says very rare, so keep that in mind

2069
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,220
when you make your guess.

2070
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:57,220
And in the center, it's more the CGI style of Ernie,

2071
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,540
which I guess implies that it's more recent.

2072
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,740
Is this official merch?

2073
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,580
I don't know, I don't know.

2074
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:08,660
It seems, it does not feel like Keebler

2075
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:11,980
would make a reference to Bernie Sanders

2076
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,060
and I can't tell if this is from 2016

2077
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,940
or the current campaign.

2078
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,260
So feel the urn, it's a pin.

2079
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,180
I don't really have a size on this,

2080
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:25,500
but it was a pin, it's a pin.

2081
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,460
But I care to take a guess.

2082
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:30,860
Jason, go first.

2083
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,140
$40?

2084
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,100
Mike?

2085
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,420
I'm gonna say 99 cents.

2086
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,180
This costs $240.

2087
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,300
Oh my God.

2088
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,860
More money than 200 kites.

2089
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,700
What?

2090
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,740
I do not understand this pricing whatsoever.

2091
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,260
What the hell?

2092
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,780
I don't know, that just doesn't,

2093
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:57,980
you get one pin, it looks like pretty low res by the way.

2094
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:01,340
And then, but for less money, you get 200 kites?

2095
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,700
It's crazy.

2096
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,020
Yeah, madness.

2097
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,820
This is like when you try to buy Keebler cookies

2098
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,860
at like 7-Eleven and you're like,

2099
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,860
this box isn't normally 8.50.

2100
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:17,980
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

2101
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,980
Yeah, maybe this is quarantine pricing.

2102
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,180
When I was looking through to get some EL Fudges,

2103
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,860
I thought about just shipping them via Amazon

2104
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:30,580
the normal way and they were like up charging for two boxes

2105
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,300
for like $13.

2106
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,580
I think Ernie's setting the price.

2107
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:36,700
I agree.

2108
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,860
Yeah, I think maybe even like juxtaposing him

2109
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,420
with this people's hero like Bernie Sanders is,

2110
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,780
I think it's like the weird way to like ride on his back

2111
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:49,500
and make him seem like somebody who cares about

2112
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:54,500
the rights of the every elf, just the little guy.

2113
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:59,900
And I don't think, I think they're very different people.

2114
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,540
Yeah, sorry, Jason.

2115
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,820
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

2116
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,420
I mean, Keebler is usually like Hostess,

2117
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:08,740
one of the more expensive snack cake cookie options.

2118
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,420
How expensive are they?

2119
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,580
You're talking about like a box for four or $5

2120
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,700
versus two or $3, you know?

2121
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:19,620
Okay.

2122
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:22,060
But you're trying to feed a family of four,

2123
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:25,860
I'm sure that was my mom's thinking, that adds up.

2124
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:28,220
You're gonna feed a family of four with cookies.

2125
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:32,860
Well, everyone's gonna, there are cookies in the hat,

2126
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:35,980
everyone's gonna want a little taste, you know?

2127
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,620
Yeah. That's a good point.

2128
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:40,220
Everyone is gonna want a little taste.

2129
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:43,100
And maybe a nice way to go out

2130
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:46,300
as we attribute this factory's fine work

2131
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:50,940
is to read another bit of mythology

2132
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:55,860
provided by the New York City Fudge Day pop-up exhibit

2133
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,340
that as you walked around that experience,

2134
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:03,260
you could see a plaque that contained the Elfen Creed.

2135
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:08,420
And it's pretty inspiring.

2136
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:11,100
It might make Jason shed a fudge tear.

2137
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:12,940
Let's hear it.

2138
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:13,780
Let's see it.

2139
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,900
We pledge to pursue our goal of baking cookies,

2140
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,180
crackers and snacks that are by whatever measure

2141
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:24,060
one chooses to apply, uncommonly good.

2142
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,860
Wow. Uncommonly good.

2143
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,580
That's the slogan.

2144
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,540
They say uncommonly good a lot.

2145
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,300
I mean, that's beautiful.

2146
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,580
I will say.

2147
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,980
Jason, reaction to that?

2148
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,380
This is the way.

2149
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:42,940
This is the way, as they say on the Mandalorian.

2150
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:48,100
It's pretty beautiful.

2151
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,020
Isn't there part of the Hippocratic oath

2152
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,580
that's about like...

2153
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:53,100
This is the way.

2154
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,380
No, what's the, what's the, what is it?

2155
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:56,860
First, do no harm.

2156
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:58,660
Oh, okay.

2157
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,500
Oh, it's not about good.

2158
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,100
That's right. Okay.

2159
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:06,100
Well, so the Elfen oath is first to do uncommonly good.

2160
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:07,740
Yes.

2161
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:10,180
Yeah. It's really nice.

2162
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,900
An important one to live by.

2163
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,740
Keep that in your hearts, dear listeners.

2164
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,740
Yeah. Yeah.

2165
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:20,020
It's a great thing.

2166
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:25,020
And boy, as there are shortages

2167
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:27,420
at the moment and grocery stores are crazy,

2168
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:30,220
if you know, all right,

2169
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:32,060
you, the Patreon subscriber especially,

2170
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,700
we've provided you a lot of entertainment

2171
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,220
and I just wanna say,

2172
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:38,820
if you're bored around the house in this stretch of time

2173
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:43,860
and you discover that you have a fudge terrainian river

2174
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:47,820
under your property, just a fudge terrainian spring,

2175
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,060
just loop us in, let us know.

2176
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:51,900
Yeah. I mean, I would say too,

2177
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,660
it's possible you don't even know about it.

2178
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,540
So get a shovel out and do a little digging.

2179
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,380
Cause we're like...

2180
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,260
Everyone listening, just start poking around your yard.

2181
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,740
Yeah. And it may be like, if maybe just like find a room

2182
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,540
and even in your house or apartment

2183
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,060
and just start digging that way too.

2184
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,860
If you have like just maybe, you know,

2185
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:13,100
like a closet or something,

2186
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,060
dig a hole into the floor of the closet,

2187
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,020
if it's right, like on the first floor.

2188
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,020
Yeah.

2189
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,780
So then you don't even have to go outside.

2190
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,220
Yeah. This could be an indoor activity.

2191
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,580
That's absolutely true.

2192
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,700
Because a fudge terrainian spring,

2193
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:32,620
with the contents were shared with all of the other patrons

2194
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,900
and the hosts of the show,

2195
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,580
it could save us through this crisis.

2196
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,020
Yeah. So let us know.

2197
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,780
Yeah. Send us your fudge.

2198
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,180
Send us your fudge.

2199
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:43,860
Hashtag send us your fudge.

2200
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,620
Hashtag send us your fudge.

2201
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:48,700
Well, it works for me.

2202
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,060
Hey, that was a blast.

2203
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,380
Nice taking a trip to the factory with you fellas.

2204
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,140
Yes. Likewise.

2205
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:57,140
All right. Well, stay subscribed, stay safe,

2206
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,660
and we'll be back for more soon.

2207
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,420
Yeah. ChocoSaiyan's coming soon.
