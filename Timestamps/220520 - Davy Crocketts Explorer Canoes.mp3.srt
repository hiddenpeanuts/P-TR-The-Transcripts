1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,560
The following podcast requires your participation.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,120
While the hosts do most of the work, you must mentally help steer their conversation and

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,220
keep them from veering off topic.

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,800
Your paddles are your positive thoughts.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,760
You'll know you failed if they go on a lengthy, uncomfortable detour about high school swimming.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
Now let's get ready to row.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:49,680
It's Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes on Podcast the Ride.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,400
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks hosted by three guys who will soon

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,440
be bragging about exerting mild physical effort for nine minutes.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm Scott Gardner, one of those guys joined by Mike Carlson.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Hi.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Hi, yes, I'm Mike Carlson.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,240
Did you mean 90 minutes?

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,640
Because that's how long I would like to brag about doing something physical.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
We will be.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,880
Okay, we did exert physical effort for nine minutes and we will be talking about it for

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
night.

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,200
The nine minutes was on the ride we're talking about today.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,360
Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes, which we will discuss for 90 minutes.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,320
I think most of that will be bragging about, you know, pivoting our arms slightly.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Right.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,760
And like just like feeling like the bicep pump, you know, because like Arnold Schwarzenegger

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,800
in the famous movie, I think Pumping Iron was always talking about the pump.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,120
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,280
I've never seen Pumping Iron, but I would imagine from the title that pumping.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,240
And I don't want to get too body here today already, but I guess I have to now because

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,320
he's like talking about like the pump is like an orgasm.

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
He says that.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Okay.

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,840
I'm going to say when we're talking about just a general paddling, we're going to be

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
like, you know, the paddle is as good as an orgasm.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,800
I assume that's sort of the type of thing we're all sharing.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
But I don't know.

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,120
I guess we'll bring Jason into this discussion.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Jason Sheridan.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Sure.

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah, I don't know how I feel about all that.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Okay.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, I guess the first thing to decide is are we using the word pump because we're kind

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,640
of pumping or is it paddling?

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,240
Is the paddling is like a pump, which is like, I mean, I think proper respect.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,720
You know, to the attraction would be paddling.

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Okay.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,840
But I know Mike seems really enthusiastic about this pump situation.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
So every paddle gives us a pop, which is like a pump.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
Yeah, that's that's a good compromise.

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,160
I'd like to say that we can use anything anywhere that starts with P to describe the paddling

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
motion.

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,960
So as long as it's P, I think it's all on the table today just to keep it a very it

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,840
so we don't say the same word over and over.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,800
I am glad that we're again at Forever Dog Studios, beautiful Forever Dog Studios in

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,880
North Hollywood, but where hopefully the with better mics and more professional setup, the

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,080
constant P and saying pop, which causes a pop of itself.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,760
I might be doing it every time.

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
I don't really know.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,600
But I feel like I'd be more likely to, you know, over Zoom, less professional.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,040
The technology, the technology here at Forever Dog.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,960
The P is not even something to worry about.

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,520
They have they have some some system that takes the popping problem and it fixes it.

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Well, so I can say pop and P and pump.

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Say pop P and pump.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,600
And podcast the ride as much as.

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Yep.

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,840
Jason, you can say P pod.

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,160
You can say any sort of different.

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Pooh poo.

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Pooh poo.

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Yeah.

72
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,920
And everything's going to be fine because of this new system that Forever Dog, only

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,760
podcast company that has this.

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,880
The other one is P is a bad ear wall.

75
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,240
You're getting a little Trump in there.

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,520
You're getting a little and they're the only ones that the only ones that have this.

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
The only ones.

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Let me tell you.

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,040
I will tell you this and let me tell you.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah, no, I don't.

81
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,920
I don't care for that man.

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm just imagining the psycho who's like listening to podcasts and is like, yeah, they're popping

83
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,440
their peas.

84
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
These motherfuckers.

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,040
Well, I'm sure some.

86
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,320
Waking them snap.

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Yeah.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Yeah.

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,200
So but not but not for Forever Dog podcasts because there's no P problem.

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,040
I'll give it for Wait, wait, don't tell me, you weirdo.

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Yeah.

92
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Mad weirdo.

93
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
So many P pops.

94
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Unlistenable.

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Forever Forever Dog.

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,320
And then the then the phrase is under it.

97
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,440
It just says no P problem.

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,640
And that's how the advertising is based, like to get new podcasts on the network.

99
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,840
No poppy peas.

100
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
That's right.

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Yeah.

102
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,120
Today is about Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes, the canoe ride at Disneyland.

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I say canoe ride, but it's not it's not a canoe themed ride.

104
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
It is canoes.

105
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
It's canoes that you go on.

106
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,480
These have been at a lot of the Disney parks over the years.

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,920
They don't all have them currently, but Disneyland has had them almost since the beginning.

108
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,400
And it's it's possibly a possibly a thing that people don't realize is an option.

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,880
I think that's very overlooked that I think we've done very rare.

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,040
I've done very rarely that you can take a nice canoe ride with a bunch of folks in your

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
during your day at Disneyland.

112
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Yes.

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,680
I think most people most people when they see the canoes going around sort of like behind

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,880
or in front of or Mark Twain River Boat or the big pirate ship, I think they probably

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,400
assume that's performers.

116
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Maybe that's what I thought.

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,760
They're initially well, not their animatronics, but they're I mean, that would be cool if

118
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
they like atmospheric.

119
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Yeah.

120
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah.

121
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Or something like that.

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,640
That's a bunch of Disneyland employees going around in a canoe paddling and not.

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,240
But then there's like a bunch of people in them and different clothes.

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
But most people aren't paying attention.

125
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,920
And maybe I wasn't paying attention initially.

126
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,560
You really thought at some point in time that this was an illusion done by a bunch of uncoordinated

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,880
of different ages.

128
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,800
Like people in XXL won in a minion shirts paddling.

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,360
You thought those were cast like those were plants.

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm saying like maybe initially when I went to Disneyland and I wasn't paying attention,

131
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,280
I wasn't leaning against the railing, looking out into the water and noticing, OK, there's

132
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
an eight year old in the boat.

133
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
There's are in the canoe.

134
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,480
There's a 50 year old like I didn't.

135
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
They're just it's atmosphere.

136
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
It's something you're not paying attention.

137
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
You just saw canoes.

138
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I didn't know what was for me.

139
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,960
I didn't know that was possible because it's not something they heavily advertise.

140
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,840
It's not certainly you never see that on a billboard as you're driving on the five south.

141
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000
There's never been a billboard.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
There was a sign.

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,400
There was a sign at the entrance ramp like a standalone sign, which I don't know if I've

144
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
ever seen before.

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,160
Like you mean to get to the canoe to get to the canoes.

146
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,040
There's a sign that said Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes, which is where I learned they're called

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:48,200
Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes named after the legendary psycho Davy Crockett.

148
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,320
I don't know anything.

149
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
Was Davy Crockett bad?

150
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sure if he's a man, if it's a man who lived before, you know, really any time he's

151
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,560
a man in 2005, after which all men are great.

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,480
But they are now perfect, but they were bad before 2005.

153
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,720
You can imagine if you can remember back that famous on the frontier or famous in the old

154
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,920
West, you're already like, what's it going to be?

155
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,000
I feel like when we talked about the Mike Fink keel boats, there was some crazy stuff

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,120
in there about all these guys.

157
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Yeah.

158
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,560
And that was like that was a show.

159
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,000
There's a Disney song that they still play in the parks.

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,080
I think Davy Crockett theme or whatever.

161
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,720
They start to sing it at the end of Country Bears.

162
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Oh, yeah.

163
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Right.

164
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Yes.

165
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
In Florida still.

166
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,520
But he was, you know, they superheroed him in Walt's day and on Disney television and

167
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,920
stuff and he's just the left.

168
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,000
They haven't.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,680
This is one of those rides where they haven't noticed it's still there.

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I feel like.

171
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
So it hasn't been rethemed or anything.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,960
It's still like Davy Crockett and no one like other than old people like know what that

173
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
is at this point.

174
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah, it just sounds like the atmosphere.

175
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,560
Like just if you call something the Hoot and Holler, it sounds like an old West thing.

176
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,160
You wouldn't know. Oh, there was a series called Hoot and Holler that ran from 67 to

177
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
63.

178
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,080
Right. And I guess Davy Crockett, like this, I guess Davy Crockett was his main.

179
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,000
Did he ride a horse?

180
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
Probably rode a horse. Right.

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,200
Well, what a great history podcast.

182
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,600
Yeah. So Davy Crockett probably rode a horse.

183
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
He had to ride a horse. Right.

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
I think there was a horse business.

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Everyone rode a horse.

186
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,680
I think there was some canoe business, some boat business.

187
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,240
So he had like, OK, I'm just trying to put this into something that I can understand.

188
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
Like he had a Batmobile and a Batboat.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
So Davy Crockett had like multiple probably.

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm not sure that Davy Crockett had a canoe.

191
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,800
Is the real. I was trying to find other.

192
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,520
There was no proof that he ever was in a canoe.

193
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,160
It happened on the show.

194
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,800
I think they just well, they needed to rename it something that they had.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
Yeah, they need an area.

196
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,640
They needed to rename it something less horrifying that it's opening day.

197
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Yeah. So, yeah.

198
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,560
Well, look, it opened as the Indian War Canoes.

199
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Yes. Not good.

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,440
No. On July 4th, 1956.

201
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,160
On the day on Independence Day, they opened the Indian War Canoes.

202
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,640
Which was like, OK, it was part of a greater area

203
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,600
that used to be where bear country is now called the Indian Village.

204
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,680
And that was a Disneyland for the first couple of decades of its run.

205
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,320
And you might say that Walt Disney did not have the best read on the culture.

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,280
An excerpt that I found from the you might if you can you imagine that?

207
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
Yeah. According.

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,280
This is an excerpt from the book More Mouse Tales by David Koenig.

209
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,600
OK, the Indian War Canoes.

210
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,880
Walt insisted only authentic Native Americans operate the canoes

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,120
and adjacent Indian village where they created sand paintings

212
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,680
and perform ceremonial dances.

213
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,120
He even went Walt went to a Navajo reservation to recruit them.

214
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
Unaware that Navajos are from the desert and none had the slightest idea

215
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,320
how to paddle or steer a canoe.

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,800
So he just took an arbitrary like, yeah, you guys, right?

217
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,560
Did no research about the tribe or where they generally

218
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,960
lived or what they don't believe this.

219
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Walt Disney didn't know the nuances and didn't know the difference

220
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
between different Native American cultures.

221
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,000
That's great. I can't believe it was not.

222
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah. And there were like Native American performers at Disneyland

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,440
for many years. Yeah.

224
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,840
Where you could like where like I've seen like different debates of like,

225
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,520
obviously, some people were like, this sucks.

226
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,440
Why is this is Disneyland?

227
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,680
And it sucks in the sense that like you're exploiting Native American culture

228
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,880
for your Mickey Mouse Park.

229
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
Mm hmm. But then other people are like, well, there was some representation.

230
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,200
So sure. As opposed to then how it played out, which is this was.

231
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,920
So it was an attraction, the rare attraction where there was the like

232
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,360
there was a rule about it, like that it had to be

233
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,040
a Navajo Navajo man, I guess, two restrictions there.

234
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,760
It'd be a male Navajo piloting the canoe.

235
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,920
And then very bravely in the 70s, Disney

236
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,680
allowed anybody to.

237
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,920
So, yeah, in a glorious move,

238
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,760
white people were allowed to finally steer the canoes.

239
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,680
Well, a very progressive decision.

240
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,920
Yes, specifically very jacked people usually doing this.

241
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,440
Well, that's yeah, that's a thing.

242
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,600
And I've only been on this canoe trip twice.

243
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,880
Everyone who does it is very good shape because they are just canoe

244
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,720
paddling all day. Yeah.

245
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,040
Yeah. I didn't realize.

246
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,960
I feel like I am tricked once again by Disney boats,

247
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,160
because I talked about piloting the Mark Twain once quickly realizing like,

248
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,080
oh, this steering wheel does nothing.

249
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Why am I whole gripping it like death gripping it?

250
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,680
It's on a track. What am I thinking?

251
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,120
Mark Twain is on a track.

252
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,680
Yeah, the Mark Twain and the Columbia are on tracks.

253
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,480
When you were driving and you get the certificate.

254
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,880
Yeah. Oh, you thought you were actually moving?

255
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,560
For a split second, I was like really, really, really

256
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,920
really holding on to it.

257
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm like, what am I? Wait, what am I doing?

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,520
Like I can like step back.

259
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,640
Well, was that instinct or was that because you actually thought I'm going to steer this thing?

260
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,000
It was the pirates and I knew I didn't do anything because I kind of jerked it once just to double check.

261
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,120
You tried to crash the Mark Twain just to see what would happen.

262
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,360
We were in a big open area and I was like, does this do anything?

263
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,120
Like, does it wiggle it a little?

264
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,440
Because, you know, I've heard there's antique cars at a lot of amusement parks where like

265
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,360
you steer it a little, they're on a track, but you like a little.

266
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,160
Yeah, like Autopia.

267
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,520
My old control.

268
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,400
You thought maybe you could like take it up and on to Splash Mountain or something.

269
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,600
I didn't go that far, but this one is a functioning boat.

270
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,800
You are paddling, but on the official Disneyland website, it says, no, before you go,

271
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,000
the boats are lightweight and most of the paddling is more for fun than actual propulsion.

272
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,120
While your help is appreciated, the river guides who sit in the fore and aft of the canoe

273
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,560
are capable of navigating the waters by themselves.

274
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,360
So like you don't have to do a lot, but the first time I did this,

275
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,640
the vibe from the cast members were never stop paddling.

276
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,320
Never stop.

277
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,600
We got to do this.

278
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,400
And my arms hurt like all day.

279
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,640
Yeah.

280
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,680
Well, you warned us.

281
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,640
I had the desire to do this and maybe do an episode about it.

282
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,640
You were very like, just so you know, your arms will hurt all day.

283
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,080
But then we had very leisurely like laissez faire paddlers.

284
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,000
They had a lot of breaks built in.

285
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,000
They were talking to us a lot and it was much more pleasant.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was a much more pleasant experience, although we did do this on the hot dog day.

287
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,200
Yes.

288
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah.

289
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,960
But I think there was I think we were only three hot dogs in by that, which is one per.

290
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
So we were not wrecked yet.

291
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,640
Towards the end of the day, it could have been more of a problem, but I did like that.

292
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
It felt like a necessary pairing.

293
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,520
If we're going to eat hot dogs all day, exert mild physical effort for nine minutes.

294
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,760
Yeah.

295
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,720
We were not so full by the end of the day.

296
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,240
Maybe it would have been worse, but I don't know.

297
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,400
I feel like I could have paddled at the end of the day.

298
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,640
Sure.

299
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,200
Well, knowing what it was, which now I, you know, you gave that warning, Jason,

300
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,280
that was my recollection as well.

301
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,680
That maybe the last time that I did this and I may have been 13 years old,

302
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,760
that it utterly wore me out.

303
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,240
I also, a couple things there, it might have been in the dead heat of summer when I imagine

304
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,160
it might be a little unpleasant to do this canoe attraction at any point, at any age,

305
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,000
any physical capability.

306
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,120
But I also, I think something occurred to me while doing it and realizing it was pretty mild,

307
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,480
that I was a weak ass 13 year old.

308
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,640
Sure.

309
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,000
I think I was in really, really terrible shape.

310
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
Do you think, we were all in bad shape at 13.

311
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,840
I think there's no denying that.

312
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
And are not, by the way.

313
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,680
Well, now nobody's an Arnold style pumper.

314
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,640
Who's pumping now?

315
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
We're all checking ourselves on the monitor.

316
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,720
And now we wait, are we?

317
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,440
I don't know.

318
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,960
Maybe I am in good shape.

319
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,480
Let's see everybody, I or everybody flex.

320
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,440
I will say I did do a pull up a couple months ago, a single pull up.

321
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,120
And I was like, oh good, I can do a pull up like still.

322
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh good.

323
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,920
And it took me forever to be able to do a pull up because in elementary school,

324
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,640
I remember kids would be doing pull ups and I was just, just like,

325
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,280
like the most comical version of like making noises and I couldn't do it.

326
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,920
My scrawny arms could not pull me up.

327
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,160
And then I do remember in high school at one point, I did a pull up and I was like, whoa, what?

328
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,480
Something happened.

329
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
The change happened.

330
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,280
I did a lot of hangs.

331
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,760
Sure.

332
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,280
Like, just hold on for getting up there.

333
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,960
It's usually was a little high for me getting up there was half the battle.

334
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,720
Did you have, because you would do, you would do different challenges.

335
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,320
We had the bent arm hang to see how long you could hang.

336
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,360
It wasn't a pull up.

337
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,320
And then you hung, it was just hold on to your arms and see how long you could do.

338
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,280
That's what I'm saying.

339
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,120
They would usually pivot to like, oh, this one ain't doing a pull up.

340
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,200
Yeah.

341
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,960
So what can we do that still feels like you crossed some kind of threshold?

342
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
You achieved something.

343
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,800
Yeah.

344
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,280
Gotcha.

345
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,880
How long we talking on these bent arm?

346
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,920
I'm trying to remember.

347
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,560
I feel like I was actually pretty good at the bent arm hang.

348
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,800
I could hang for a while, but I feel like maybe it was like 47 seconds or something,

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
which seems not the long time.

350
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,040
Yeah.

351
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,120
No, but I have a feeling that if I tried a bent arm hang, I would be saying pretty quickly,

352
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,160
was that 47 seconds?

353
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120
Did I beat Mike?

354
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,720
And they've been somebody, anyone timing, timing me would say, no, that was eight.

355
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
It was eight seconds.

356
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,000
Uh-huh.

357
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,400
You have six more of these to go.

358
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,160
Should we challenge each other to physical challenges during this episode?

359
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,360
I think so.

360
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,480
I don't think we're, well,

361
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,080
There's not a lot of room in here.

362
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,040
We could, I think we're sort of near a recreation area.

363
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,960
We'd have to, we could like go do a jog, see what's there in terms that could test our

364
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,400
abilities and jog back and then see how, not just who did the best, but who is like too

365
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
wrecked to continue.

366
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
My bet would be all of us.

367
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,400
That the entire, it'd be a good thing to utilize this video that we're using right now.

368
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,480
For us to suddenly leave and then come back just wrecked, just drenched in sweat.

369
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,200
Beat red.

370
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,080
Yeah.

371
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,920
We, you know, it's just running up, you know, there's Universal Studios is not too far from here

372
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,360
and running up the hill off of Lancashire maybe is what we should be doing.

373
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,680
We should run up because there's usually a tram that takes you up there.

374
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,160
Yeah.

375
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,280
The run would be rough.

376
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,920
The run would be insane.

377
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,840
Yeah, the walk is awful.

378
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,480
Walking up it is insane.

379
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,520
The walk is bad.

380
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,760
I did it when I was like, I'm just going to do the walk.

381
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,800
It's a nice day out.

382
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,240
It was like the middle of summer.

383
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,600
No, that was the worst idea.

384
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,760
If you fall, you will roll down the hill like a barrel, like it's screwed.

385
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,800
Like you don't do it.

386
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,160
It's really dangerous.

387
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,920
I haven't been so concerned about the fall.

388
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
I don't think I'm going to.

389
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,760
You're also falling in a way that you don't just face plant.

390
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,880
You don't just go forward.

391
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,320
You would have to fall to the side and then, and then the roll would have to continue.

392
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,640
You'd have to be so even on that slant for it to become a full roll all the way down.

393
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,120
Okay.

394
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,960
Well, you're trying to like angle it so you end up in the Sheraton.

395
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,760
Like you stop the fall by like pushing yourself into the Sheraton valet port coche.

396
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,720
In your in your dream of this, you're rolling down the hill in a little ball.

397
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,680
You like hit like a curb or so or hit a bump and you just break through the window of one

398
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,120
of the hotel rooms and land in the bed and fall asleep immediately.

399
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,600
Well, you've flasked it up for sure.

400
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,080
And then you don't have to pay for the room.

401
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,120
You got to go up a couple stories that you have to hit a bounce that perfectly gummy

402
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,280
bear bounce style launches you up to like the fourth floor at least.

403
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,320
I don't remember where sloppy Telly's room was.

404
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,800
Telly's is probably sweet at the Sheraton.

405
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
Probably at the top floor, right?

406
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
No, I think he might've been the second.

407
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,240
I think he wanted to like, it's just a quick walk down the stairs.

408
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
And now I'm here at the bar, baby.

409
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,320
I don't have to I don't have to take that eight second elevator ride.

410
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,360
Yeah, it's the Telly's only 10 steps away from the swig of vodka at all times.

411
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,160
I can get down to that stinky lobby real quick.

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,640
Did you see there was a thing going around a couple months ago?

413
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,680
If you don't know, we're talking about during the Universal City Walk saga.

414
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,480
We we were talking about how Telly Savalas, star of Kojak, lived at the Sheraton Universal.

415
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,800
If you don't know what we're talking about, what Kojak is and we really.

416
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, sorry. You have to look it up.

417
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,640
He also had a singing career that I've been fascinated by lately.

418
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,200
Oh, yeah.

419
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,680
Yeah, some really good videos.

420
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,800
But he had a bar, the bar, he would go to the bar at the Sheraton like every night

421
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,840
because he lived there and they called it Telly's still called Telly's.

422
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,480
But there was some article like People Magazine or something where he was just like,

423
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,800
yeah, I've had affairs and my wife isn't happy.

424
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,040
It was like the headline on the thing.

425
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,240
That's not exactly what it was.

426
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,640
But it was like some major publication and he was just like, yeah, I cheat on my wife.

427
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,600
So what, baby?

428
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,320
Really interesting.

429
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,720
Honest.

430
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,600
Really interesting man.

431
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,800
Appreciate the honesty.

432
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,300
Yeah.

433
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,000
There's maybe another thing to talk about at the right.

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,200
So this seemed like a fun thing to do that we're going there for our hot dog day.

435
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,000
And then what's I think, Mike, you threw out what's an attraction

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,560
we've not done on the show or done altogether.

437
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,880
And this seemed like a fun one to do because it's involved and interactive.

438
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,200
And so we were excited to do it.

439
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,640
We went to go do it.

440
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,520
We're on the stairs heading down to grab our paddles and for our canoe ride to begin.

441
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,360
And then Jason says, with a lot of judgment, I feel.

442
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,640
So this is main feed, right?

443
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,360
This is main feed.

444
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,660
Yeah.

445
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,160
Very.

446
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,880
What's wrong?

447
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Answering the not posing it for debate, but asserting not since Lucy attribute,

448
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,760
I think, has there been this kind of jockeying for the main feed?

449
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,080
Yeah.

450
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,200
The almost anger that it would be asserted any other way.

451
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
I got another one coming up.

452
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,760
There's another one coming out that I think could be topical.

453
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,040
Something is finally returned.

454
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,280
One of the final things to return.

455
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,760
OK.

456
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,840
And you're saying it a main feed and not on our picture.

457
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,160
I think I'm curious to see what everyone's opinion is.

458
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,200
We just get it out now.

459
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,920
What do we do?

460
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,760
The red car trolleys finally coming back to Disney's California Adventure.

461
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,400
Main feed.

462
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,960
Yeah.

463
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,600
Yeah.

464
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,680
Because Suitcase and a Dream is involved in that.

465
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,360
Oh, that's true.

466
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,000
Am I finally at my day of reckoning of having to deal even more with Suitcase and a Dream?

467
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
Suitcase and a Dream will be unpacked.

468
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,200
If you don't know what we're talking about, it's a song that is like kind of a techno beat,

469
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,320
but it's about Newsies and them singing about Mickey Mouse coming to California.

470
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,320
And we've talked about this like the kayfabe Mickey origin where he met Walt on a train.

471
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,320
It's like Walt didn't create him, but they were like two bums on a train and they teamed up

472
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,200
basically.

473
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,520
So this is a song about having a suitcase and a dream.

474
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,120
I think that means that's coming back or we don't know?

475
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,160
I don't know.

476
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,040
OK.

477
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
I don't know about live entertainment.

478
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,960
But we will talk about this red trolley on main feed.

479
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
Historic in the Los Angeles area.

480
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,680
This city was just covered in red car trolley lines for years.

481
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
Yeah, but not this specific vehicle.

482
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,920
Not this one.

483
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,040
It's paying tribute to the historic red car trolley, which you cannot navigate, right?

484
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,640
They don't let you drive that.

485
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,440
Drive what?

486
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,160
They do Mark Twain.

487
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
The red car trolley.

488
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,440
Oh, no.

489
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,520
No, because those controls are functioning.

490
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,080
Uh-huh.

491
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,560
Sure.

492
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,440
I was just wondering if there was some fake steering wheel or something.

493
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,160
I don't think so.

494
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,920
I guess they don't have a steering wheel.

495
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,280
That was kind of what you said about this.

496
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,960
I feel like then a brief rationalization of it was like historic.

497
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,200
And you like banged your arm like that a little bit.

498
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,480
Well, I feel like sometimes we get a little tickled with our little second gay weirdo episodes.

499
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,600
We do get a little tickled.

500
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,000
I agree.

501
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,400
I find myself reaching sometimes of like, yeah, what's the main feed?

502
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,600
In theory, the main episodes of this podcast.

503
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,440
And I'm like, yeah, carousel.

504
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,400
But then suddenly it's like, you know, Lucille Ball did a voice on an episode of Rescue Range.

505
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
That didn't happen, obviously.

506
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Because we would shut this down and go watch it right now.

507
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,240
Yeah, absolutely.

508
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,920
We would talk about it every episode.

509
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,160
Yeah.

510
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,800
Well, then I got home, talked about having a nice canoe experience.

511
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,920
And Aaron said, oh, that's nice.

512
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,360
You guys are going to do a second gate about it.

513
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,040
And I was like, oh, yeah, well, it's a whole thing.

514
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,520
It came up.

515
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
We had a little tip about it.

516
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,560
And I guess it's going to be on the main feed.

517
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,040
Yeah.

518
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,280
Yeah.

519
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,720
So no, I don't mind this.

520
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,120
I'm just I just thought it was a very us moment for that discussion to be that question to be posed.

521
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,320
Sure.

522
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah.

523
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,920
So here we are.

524
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
Here we are.

525
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,360
No paywall.

526
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,000
It's happening.

527
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,320
Yeah.

528
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,520
Video for you.

529
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:16,920
Yes.

530
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,480
On video.

531
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,280
I keep forgetting that's there.

532
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,760
Yeah.

533
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,240
That's good.

534
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,960
Turn your back to it or else you'll be.

535
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,720
It's like Celebrity Big Brother or something.

536
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,480
You're wondering where my eye line is.

537
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,560
It is staring at this.

538
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,200
It is odd.

539
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,560
It's like having a fourth person in the room and it's a three headed monster.

540
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,640
That is all of us.

541
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,120
Right.

542
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,920
And find a new eye line.

543
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,720
I try not to look.

544
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,040
Yeah.

545
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,520
Camera.

546
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,680
I think it'd be much weirder to just look in the camera the whole time.

547
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,720
The first time.

548
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,760
Yeah, that is weird.

549
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,120
That is.

550
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,280
Yeah.

551
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,480
If you're watching on video right now, let's all look into the camera.

552
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,840
Our own different cameras.

553
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,120
Give everyone a nice stare.

554
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,680
Okay.

555
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,160
Okay.

556
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,960
Jason, find yours.

557
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,120
And.

558
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,960
Everyone listening.

559
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,000
You know.

560
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,560
Shut up and hold your pose.

561
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,200
Hold your pose.

562
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,520
Okay.

563
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,400
Okay.

564
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Now we just need to give everybody a frame.

565
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,720
Yeah.

566
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,040
Got it.

567
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,280
Okay.

568
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,000
Creepy frame.

569
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,440
What were you saying?

570
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,920
I was going to say everyone listening on their phones is just like I love when they

571
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,520
talk about the video set up.

572
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,040
Yeah, they do like that.

573
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,400
Well, it's new and they're going to learn to like it.

574
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Yeah, that's just because we run the show here.

575
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,360
Okay.

576
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,920
We tell them.

577
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,520
We tell you what to like.

578
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,640
Let's talk about our experience.

579
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,200
And you know what?

580
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,400
Let's use the medium for the people watching the YouTube link.

581
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,400
Brett, can we pull up a photo of us having a blast on this canoe?

582
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,800
This is a post Jason and his hot dog mountain shirt.

583
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,040
Yeah.

584
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,680
This is a great little slide show.

585
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,080
Wonderful picture.

586
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Let's hold on this one for a second.

587
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,120
This I feel like is a Jason in his element.

588
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,480
Not just in a hot dog mountain shirt, but just past the Mark Twain knowing that you're

589
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,720
feeling the Mark Twain's in the air.

590
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,680
The smoke stacks are blowing a familiar smoke to you.

591
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,680
You're out on the high seat.

592
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,320
This is a very satisfied Jason, I feel.

593
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,880
Sure.

594
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,380
Yeah.

595
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,480
Are you as happy here as you appear to be?

596
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,920
I think I am.

597
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
I think I finally relaxed at this point.

598
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,480
I realized I didn't have to paddle as much.

599
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,280
Were you cheating?

600
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,720
Was I cheating?

601
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,220
Yeah.

602
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,200
No, I was full on paddling.

603
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,920
But at the start of it, I was really pushing.

604
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,480
I see.

605
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,560
Because the other time I went, it was like there weren't that, but there was a lot of

606
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,520
kids in the boat.

607
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,160
So whatever adults were there, it's just like, oh shit, we actually have to do this.

608
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,720
We had to move this boat.

609
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,400
I had not seen the website where they're like, yeah, you idiots don't really have,

610
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
you can just play paddle, whatever.

611
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,680
Well, I was wondering what the situation was.

612
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,320
That's interesting that they're public about that we are ballast and we don't matter.

613
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,960
Where you maybe figure that out is the steering.

614
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:07,400
The fact that you are turning and pivoting, and yet there's no point where the main canoe

615
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,640
operator in the front is saying, all right, now you guys on the right a little less than

616
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,560
you guys on the left a little more so that we turn and pivot a little.

617
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,320
The direction you're going is always very good.

618
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,640
You're maybe vaguely hoping with forward momentum since it is a long vehicle, but

619
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,880
steering, I feel like, is never...

620
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,360
You're not doing anything to help the direction.

621
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,080
No.

622
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,200
Yeah, there's no way.

623
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,440
Because that way you would crash into Splash Mountain or something.

624
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,080
You would definitely hit the wall.

625
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,760
It's like they were like, all right, here's what we got to do.

626
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,200
Which the mechanics of this are very impressive that it's two folks, it's no more than two

627
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,440
people, one in the front and one in the back.

628
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,400
That they are making a 20 person pretty long vehicle move and steering it and doing it

629
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,680
over and over again.

630
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,720
We did it once and now we're talking about it for a while.

631
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,840
This is just their job.

632
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,840
They do this many, many times.

633
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,760
When I was paddling, Scott, were you putting a lot of effort into it when you were paddling?

634
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,320
How do you much...

635
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,840
Do you feel like you were taking it easy?

636
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,120
I wanted to maybe just feel a little burn.

637
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,840
A little pump, yeah.

638
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Get my little pump pop.

639
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,040
At least a little pump.

640
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,680
Just feel a little something to say I did.

641
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,040
If I feel like I was doing it, I feel like the first time I did it, I was doing it in

642
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,080
an inefficient way.

643
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,560
I feel like I was doing a big like really trying to do that, which I think that's a mistake.

644
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,200
You do like...

645
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,520
Form than the actual...

646
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,120
Yeah, I think I feel like I had really good form this time and I was actually expelling less energy.

647
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,240
I think I was really helping.

648
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,560
I was really helping the journey, I feel.

649
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,360
Yeah, did you feel like were you judging yourself against other canoers and us?

650
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,680
Yes.

651
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,760
While you're behind me, you're next to Jason, you've got a better...

652
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,720
Was I behind you?

653
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,920
Not directly.

654
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,040
Jason's right behind you.

655
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,920
I was behind Scott.

656
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,560
Because I wasn't looking...

657
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,600
I was next to Mike.

658
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,040
I wasn't critiquing you or Jason as far as you're paddling because I couldn't see,

659
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,320
but I was looking at the people in front of me and I was saying,

660
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm doing better than them.

661
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm paddling better than them.

662
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,520
Yeah.

663
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,240
I was as well, but the person in front of me was a child,

664
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,040
so I felt like the rhythm was not there.

665
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,600
No, yeah.

666
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm willing to forgive.

667
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,440
So you smoked that little kid.

668
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,000
Absolutely.

669
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,680
You showed them who's boss.

670
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,480
Yeah, yeah.

671
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,240
Not with might, not with physical, but just with understanding pattern and meter.

672
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,000
Really, it's music if you think about it.

673
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,720
Paddling a canoe.

674
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,200
It rhymes.

675
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,120
Having paddled a canoe once, what I always say about it is that it's music.

676
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes, it rhymes.

677
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,400
It rhymes, yeah.

678
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,120
Very lyrical.

679
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,880
I kept poking the kid in front of me and going, do better, do better.

680
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,120
And he just wouldn't do better.

681
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,400
So I was poking him with the paddle while I was on the middle stroke.

682
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,760
We had a canoe.

683
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:05,400
My high school gym had a pool in it, and I feel like there was a metal canoe

684
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,600
that they would throw in the pool at some point.

685
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,960
During the two weeks we were in the pool and they're like,

686
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,680
now we're going to fill the canoe with water and now you got to swim to the side of the pool.

687
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,600
It's basically fuck around the canoe for a couple days.

688
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,640
I don't really quite even remember paddling it or anything.

689
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,280
We're going to throw a canoe in the fucking high school pool.

690
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,760
We're going to throw, yeah.

691
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,480
Whatever.

692
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,960
Enjoy.

693
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,880
Seems like enough, right?

694
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,040
The pool wasn't that big.

695
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,600
I mean, it was a regulation size pool.

696
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,840
I'm trying to think how big my pool, did you have a pool in high school?

697
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,920
I don't, I truly don't remember.

698
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,840
This is how checked out of athletics I was.

699
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,400
You would know.

700
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,920
I don't think I know.

701
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,240
I cannot picture if my high school had a pool.

702
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,480
Did you swim though in gym class ever?

703
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:53,960
No.

704
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,280
Okay.

705
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,040
It'd be weird if I said I didn't remember a pool, but I did remember swimming.

706
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,240
Yeah, well that would be very odd.

707
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,520
That would be in a toilet.

708
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:00,840
We had.

709
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,280
My head was flushed in one.

710
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,160
We had to swim.

711
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,920
We had to swim in gym class.

712
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,880
Did you have to swim in gym class?

713
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,280
Yeah, we had to swim in gym class and it was the later,

714
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,720
I feel like the first couple of years in gym class, it was all dudes.

715
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,320
And then the more honors classes like I had, like the gym class would be like,

716
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,440
all right, it's this gym class is all the nerds.

717
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,680
Wait, they were your high school was divided by nerds and jocks.

718
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,040
Are they all?

719
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,600
Well, but like in like an administrative.

720
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,280
Just in terms of like the timing where it's like, all right, if they're taking this AP

721
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,800
and this AP, like the only time they can take gym.

722
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,560
So they all end up in gym together.

723
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,040
I see.

724
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,960
So so like all the nerds won't hurt each other.

725
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,520
The jocks.

726
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,400
Basically, yeah, that was much more pleasant.

727
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,720
So you weren't in AP canoeing then?

728
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,560
I was not in AP canoeing.

729
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,480
No, I was in the nerd gym class where everyone was like, please, no one.

730
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,600
We've all made an agreement.

731
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,920
No one look at each other's bodies like.

732
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,320
Oh, well, that was because in the old to the sky in the old days, the kids would swim nude.

733
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,520
What?

734
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,000
What?

735
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,320
Yes.

736
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,840
How old old days?

737
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,560
The 60s.

738
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,560
I don't know that.

739
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,000
What are you talking about?

740
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,760
There was no any type of short like I think Huck and Tom would.

741
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,800
I don't know that.

742
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,320
Hold on.

743
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm pretty sure that I'm correct here.

744
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,840
But kids, I didn't know 1960.

745
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,280
No, I don't want to get arrested.

746
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm just trying to get his friends, the family from Tuck Everlasting would swim nude at the

747
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,240
old swimming hole and you would realize they weren't aging.

748
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,520
I'm pretty sure I'm right.

749
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:38,760
Yeah.

750
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Swimming naked.

751
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
My high school team did, says Chicago.

752
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,000
Now, I'm pretty sure there's a lot old family members of mine talked about this unless they

753
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,480
were punking me, which is possible, I guess.

754
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,600
I guess I'm gullible.

755
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,240
So you get so you take you strip nude and get in that.

756
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,360
I Mikey, I did not swim nude, but I think there was a time when certain high schools

757
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
were like the boys would swim nude.

758
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,200
Why?

759
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,840
Why would this?

760
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,520
What would this help?

761
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,320
What would this solve?

762
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
I don't know.

763
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,760
What is one benefit other than to particular creeps who work at the school?

764
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,280
How is it?

765
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,000
I don't know.

766
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,240
Saving precious fabric money.

767
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,800
54 cents.

768
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,640
This is like mild covering.

769
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,960
Critic boarding scandal nightmare.

770
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,280
I'm finding multiple articles about this being something that people would have to do,

771
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,720
not of probably our generation, but of older generation.

772
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,920
My we didn't even share like everyone would just walk through the shower,

773
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
like rinse off after swimming.

774
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,600
No one was like stripping down.

775
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,040
Like I never took like a shower after gym or whatever in school.

776
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,160
I have no recollection.

777
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,840
Well, I didn't take a shower.

778
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,440
I didn't take a shower after regular gym.

779
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,200
You would go through the shower after swim class, but you would keep most kids would

780
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,840
keep the suit.

781
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,920
Except one or two guys who are like, I'm going to be the naked guy.

782
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,840
I am the captain of the football team.

783
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,640
I look like I'm 25 years old.

784
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
I'm going to get naked.

785
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,240
It's true in gyms though still.

786
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,760
Some people really thrive on being the naked guy.

787
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,240
Yeah.

788
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,480
Yeah.

789
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,880
Yeah.

790
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
That was my chance.

791
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,480
But what era do you and when did this change?

792
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,640
I am an expert on nude swimming for high school boys.

793
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,800
I just know that there were certain high schools where this happened

794
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,160
and I've heard tell of it.

795
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,760
And were they firebombed?

796
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,200
Did they have their rights revoked to be a high school?

797
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,880
I don't know if there was a naked high school registry.

798
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,400
I don't know what happened.

799
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,360
I don't know.

800
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,920
If you want to do a second gate about this topic, we can.

801
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,200
I will go and research it.

802
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,920
And see, but this is the good old days.

803
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,320
This isn't some horror show like children checking out books from the library.

804
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
Like our current dystopia.

805
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,920
This is just, I think this was just what was done in certain areas.

806
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,320
Yeah.

807
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,240
This was not a weird bad thing.

808
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,560
And no one thought it was weird or bad.

809
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,640
Kid crotch Arkansas.

810
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,200
Look, when I was, I swear I heard about this when I was young and I was like,

811
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,400
this is crazy.

812
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,360
What is going on?

813
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
Why would you ever do that?

814
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,520
Hey, hurry along kid.

815
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,200
We're trying to put asbestos in.

816
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,800
Get to your nude swimming class.

817
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,320
The painters are coming to put on a new coat of lead paint.

818
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,520
Look, not our generation.

819
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,000
I swam with little red shorts like Mickey Mouse.

820
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,560
Okay.

821
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,800
We wore little buttons.

822
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
They wouldn't let us swim with our own shorts.

823
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,480
Also, was that what your experience was?

824
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,600
Wait, no, what is this?

825
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,040
Well, we were supposed to wear the school colors for our regular gym clothes,

826
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,720
which were maroon and gray.

827
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,680
So like anything maroon and gray, you know, shorts or sweatpants and a t-shirt for swim class.

828
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,800
They were just like, oh, fuck it.

829
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,240
Just whatever swimsuit you have.

830
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,200
Who cares?

831
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,280
No, we had to wear new short, like their shorts that they washed as if they were like the

832
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,040
glasses on Transformers.

833
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,880
We had to put on new red, little red swim trunks every time.

834
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,400
Little red, every uniformed little red trunks.

835
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,280
They were shorter trunks than I like to wear it, at least at the time.

836
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
So lining up, getting your shorts line.

837
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Yes, you would have to get in a shorts line.

838
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,640
You would be handed shorts.

839
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,720
Did you request a size or was it kind of one size?

840
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
Yes, there would be a size.

841
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,120
There would be different, I think there would be different like bags

842
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,800
and you would get different size shorts.

843
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,600
You'd say large and they'd say no, extra small and you'd say, oh, maybe next time.

844
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,920
Yeah, they would say that doesn't look as good on you.

845
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
They would assess it.

846
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,560
Here, spin around.

847
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,720
No, change to the extra small.

848
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,240
So yeah, you would get shorts and then you would put them in a big thing and they would wash them.

849
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,600
I don't know why you couldn't wear your own swim trunks.

850
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,400
That's crazy.

851
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,240
Yeah, this is my experience swimming in high school.

852
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,640
Did anyone get in the big washing machine with all of the used shorts?

853
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,480
It's like a prank.

854
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,520
Then you know, really?

855
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,080
No, no, no.

856
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:01,720
I mean, so like, I'm just going to I just need to clean the machine and then why are they in there for the washing?

857
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,840
You mean they're like a pervert?

858
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,160
Yeah.

859
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,560
Okay.

860
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,520
They're like, you know, something was really up at your high school.

861
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,240
Somebody that guy was a holdover from the 60s era.

862
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,320
Oh, like with the nude swimming.

863
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,480
Yeah.

864
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,760
No, I don't remember anyone doing that, but I was honestly the part where you would turn them in and

865
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,760
take them off and put all that was like, I wanted to get that done as fast as possible

866
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,520
because it was so strange because you would have to like.

867
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,400
Shorts check in.

868
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,720
Yeah.

869
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,680
Turn in your sopping wet shorts into this bin.

870
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,360
Yes.

871
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,320
This is what I did.

872
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,040
Like this is I would have to like you put the towel around.

873
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
I was so nervous about it and like pull the thing off.

874
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,880
Community shorts, everyone.

875
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,600
Yeah.

876
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,560
I did think it was weird because you were wearing like, hopefully they were washing these things.

877
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,760
This is communism.

878
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,080
It was a way to teach you why your socialism is bad.

879
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,040
This is what happens.

880
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,840
Now you all end up wearing shorts instead of buying your own.

881
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,200
It was the closest thing I had.

882
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,680
Like we had to like school uniforms or something.

883
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,800
You didn't have school uniforms.

884
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,000
No, you had to share Mickey style red shorts.

885
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,120
We had to we wore Mickey style red swim trunks.

886
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,800
And then did the gym teacher have to do a load of reds?

887
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,240
Like a lot of laundry.

888
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,040
Someone did.

889
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,920
Someone did.

890
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,560
Every day.

891
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,240
Every day.

892
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,640
Every day they would supposedly wash our swim, our little red swim trunks.

893
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,920
You know, I do remember the gym teacher's office had washer dryers in it.

894
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,800
And I think it was for like, I always assumed that was for like football uniforms and stuff.

895
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,600
And maybe it was.

896
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,320
I'm for sure.

897
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,680
It's probably for collecting.

898
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,240
I think we've I think we're continuing to solve the mystery.

899
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,400
Yeah, I've never heard this one.

900
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,240
Mike's comfort with certain things.

901
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Mike's feelings about certain things.

902
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,760
I didn't.

903
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:44,920
Okay.

904
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,400
I did not.

905
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
Just for clarification.

906
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,280
I did not swim nude, but I did have to wear like.

907
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,000
No, they got shorts were said many times.

908
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,720
Little red shorts.

909
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,360
They painted the picture.

910
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,600
Okay.

911
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,600
I just want to make sure that people know exactly where my damage comes from.

912
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,520
And it wasn't the first part.

913
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,160
It was the second part of this whole chunk of this podcast.

914
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,400
The red shorts are more humiliating.

915
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,840
I feel like the nudity.

916
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,560
To some degree.

917
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:07,800
Yeah.

918
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,480
But honestly, once I was in swim class, because our teacher was really checked out,

919
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,360
he would just go and like play solitaire or be on eBay and we would just do whatever we wanted.

920
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,640
But there was no canoe involved.

921
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,760
I gotta say the swim class unit.

922
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,480
That's not one you want to be checked out on.

923
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,440
Oh, well, I feel like badminton floor hockey.

924
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,680
Yeah, you can check out all those.

925
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,400
But you mean the one where like kids are just jumping off a diving board and in my case,

926
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,720
doing wrestling moves to each other off the deck.

927
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,400
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

928
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,900
Yeah.

929
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,840
Probably not a good idea to be in your office.

930
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,080
Yeah.

931
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,720
Barely checked in.

932
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,320
Running and running on slippery tile.

933
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,960
Yes.

934
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,520
Yeah, no, he was and nobody I think got that hurt.

935
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,200
If that hurt at all.

936
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,560
I didn't get hurt.

937
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,880
Soon enough, the water is not just red from little red shorts, but red from blood.

938
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,360
I do remember an embarrassing time when I did.

939
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,680
I was getting a back body drop by these two dudes who would I would run at them in the pool

940
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,280
and then they just kind of lift me up and flip me over back into the water.

941
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,720
And I do remember my shorts like flying off once, which was like, oh, my God.

942
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Oh, that's just so gone at that point because they were used every day.

943
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,560
It's like Bart Simpson.

944
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,120
Yeah, that was that was really awful.

945
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,040
Yes, that was that was like a nightmare.

946
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
Like, oh, my God.

947
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,920
High school nightmare scenario.

948
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:41,160
Two men, two men, two boys also clad in little red shorts, lifted you up in the air in springy red.

949
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,200
I don't know.

950
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,640
Yeah, boy, what happened here?

951
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,480
This is a really bad territory.

952
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:45,720
Yeah.

953
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:45,960
Yeah.

954
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,240
And that was like that's like, yeah, that is the one time I remember just like being just mortified.

955
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
So what's out there?

956
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,240
Now I put it all out there on audio and video forever, dog.

957
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,040
Thank you so much.

958
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,080
I'm glad I went.

959
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,240
I went until we had video to say that all of us, for God's sake, find this is there.

960
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,800
There could be no drier facts in an episode about canoe.

961
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,880
Find the driest fact you have in your notes.

962
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,320
Oh, oh, that is canoe.

963
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,880
What do we got?

964
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,240
Canoe is a Canadian word.

965
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,440
That helps.

966
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:16,760
Great.

967
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,080
Great.

968
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,680
OK, that is not anywhere near.

969
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,640
They call this the Beaver Brothers Explorer.

970
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,840
No, that doesn't help.

971
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,680
No, brothers doesn't help at all.

972
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,680
That week, we're still in weird territory.

973
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,960
I do like that name, though.

974
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,960
This is close to a couple of parks.

975
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,760
My dad did not even remember this being at the Magic Kingdom.

976
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,120
So I did not do this as a kid.

977
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,760
This close to the Magic Kingdom in 94 closed in Paris in 94 to only

978
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,080
has been two years at Disneyland Paris.

979
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,600
Why did they even bother?

980
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,240
Strange.

981
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,120
Nobody wanted to.

982
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,160
It was one of those miscalculations about the French.

983
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,200
Yeah, they want to.

984
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,240
If they started allowing wine everywhere and they probably should have allowed them on

985
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,560
the canoes, they should allow that on the boy.

986
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,840
I would really like to.

987
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,920
I mean, if there was assuming they could put in little cup holders, if I could

988
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,680
paddle a little bit.

989
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,800
What about pumpkin pop?

990
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,960
I grabbed my pinot pump, pop and pinot.

991
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,880
Now we're talking on this canoe.

992
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,040
What about you could attach a little glass of wine to the end of the paddle?

993
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,160
So when you were like, and then like you bring it back up and you take a little sip

994
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,520
and then you put it back in.

995
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,640
I like the idea here.

996
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,720
It just feels like there's probably a splash.

997
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,760
Yeah, I guess you're right.

998
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,160
I think a camel back is probably most efficient.

999
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,680
What about a baby camel back?

1000
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,360
Like the bag, the plastic bag with a long straw.

1001
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,840
Oh, sure.

1002
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,720
But you know, you're doing that with wine and now it's very strange territory.

1003
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,760
Yeah, yeah.

1004
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,200
Though, hey, I don't know.

1005
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,080
Not a bad idea.

1006
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,800
Not a bad idea for dad here.

1007
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Take that out to the park.

1008
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,240
Little discreet tube.

1009
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,560
Sure.

1010
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:59,320
And when he starts playing baseball or something, let's talk a little bit about our experience,

1011
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:05,320
though, on that day, because, you know, talking about having wine or whatever on the.

1012
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:13,480
I will say this in that spirit and in terms of what you're after in a ride in your in your 30s,

1013
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,320
this is a very, it's a very adult ride, I would say, a very adult attraction in terms of it's

1014
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,680
not a lot of hassle.

1015
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,600
There's a lot of relaxation, just like, you know, getting out and being in the fake wilderness.

1016
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Like in the was did Matt Appaduck say, would you call Soren a mom ride?

1017
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,920
Yeah, it was a mom ride.

1018
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,320
Yeah.

1019
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,080
Well, maybe canoes is a dad ride.

1020
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:45,240
It feels very like part and parcel with the, you know, if I want a little resort experience

1021
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,760
in the parks, maybe I have some wine.

1022
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,800
I do Soren, I do canoes and I don't get stressed out by a bunch of.

1023
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:51,960
Right.

1024
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,920
Beeps and buzzes.

1025
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,880
I just just to just to say exactly what Matt said, because it's so good.

1026
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,040
He called Soren the Josh Groban of rides.

1027
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,880
Yeah, I forgot that.

1028
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,000
Yes, that's yeah.

1029
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,160
Is this like the Yellowstone of rides?

1030
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,920
I don't know.

1031
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,800
I haven't seen it.

1032
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,760
You get a nice.

1033
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,960
I haven't watched it yet.

1034
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,240
I'm going to see it though.

1035
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,760
You get a lower view.

1036
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,640
You get like a water level view almost.

1037
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,040
Yeah.

1038
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,440
Of like the CC, the death beaver, the beaver chewing on the railroad.

1039
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,680
Yeah.

1040
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,720
That's so yeah, maybe people have not seen that.

1041
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,320
That's a newer in the kind of the revamp of Rivers of America.

1042
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,000
That's a detail I forget about that.

1043
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,520
He's chomping on that bridge.

1044
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,040
Yeah, it's great.

1045
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,160
It's really, really great.

1046
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,480
It is the only thing.

1047
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:35,800
Yeah.

1048
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,720
When you're talking about an adult experience and that's when we when we say that we mean

1049
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,440
something different.

1050
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
We mean forget what the last 10.

1051
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:42,760
Yeah.

1052
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,080
Yeah.

1053
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,960
None of that stuff.

1054
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,920
None of the body talk.

1055
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,120
But yeah, an adult, it seems like you want to feel like the air.

1056
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,320
You want to feel the nice air.

1057
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,960
You want to feel like a stillness and a calmness.

1058
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,920
Some scenery.

1059
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,800
Scenery is nice.

1060
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,480
And this definitely has it.

1061
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,600
I think the only I guess I'm getting ahead of myself with the plus up for something like

1062
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:04,600
this would be longer and just like sections where we're just sitting for like 10, 15,

1063
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,320
20 minutes.

1064
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,920
You're just describing camping, I think.

1065
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,520
Maybe what you're after.

1066
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,840
Or in a boat in any sort of boat, I suppose.

1067
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,360
So now an expedition has to go out instead of continuously go around.

1068
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,040
It has to take several breaks where everyone just kind of like sits.

1069
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,560
Yeah, like there would be multiple canoes then then on the Rivers of America,

1070
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,760
where they just say, OK, now kick back.

1071
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,200
And so you put your feet up a little bit and you kind of like put your head toward the sun

1072
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,960
and then you relax.

1073
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,840
Some breaks.

1074
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,160
Yeah.

1075
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,680
It has some like breaks where they would just talk to us.

1076
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,600
I could not hear what the cast member was saying.

1077
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:46,840
Yes.

1078
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,400
They were talking a little too quietly, but like we were in the back.

1079
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,240
Also, yeah, that's unfair.

1080
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,880
Yeah.

1081
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,760
Get louder.

1082
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,120
Yeah, I mean, they should be.

1083
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,240
You want to hear the whole.

1084
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,520
I could hear what they were saying.

1085
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,880
Also, I couldn't hear shit.

1086
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,360
I got the.

1087
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,200
Stopped by the moose and the tracks from Mind Train.

1088
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,520
Yeah.

1089
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,160
Through nature's.

1090
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,520
I'm just saying I'm agreeing with what you're saying, and I'm just saying like the ultimate

1091
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,440
version of the adult experience is like kind of spending an hour on the water or something.

1092
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,040
Yeah, that's the ultimate version.

1093
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,440
I'm just looking at blue sky and I understand it's not practical.

1094
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,240
They got to move.

1095
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,680
Got to get these canoes in and out.

1096
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,280
People, the demand is high.

1097
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,560
We saw the line.

1098
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,160
There were at least 10 people like the, you know, the endless grind.

1099
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,360
Capitalism.

1100
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,920
Yeah.

1101
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,640
In and out.

1102
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,760
Honk, honk, honk.

1103
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,040
Why can't we slow our theme park canoes down?

1104
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,760
Exactly.

1105
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,520
Enjoy the fake elements.

1106
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,080
Exactly.

1107
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,040
Hi, folks.

1108
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,000
Michael here.

1109
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,120
I have a question for you.

1110
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,720
Are you trying to find love?

1111
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,560
Of course you are.

1112
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,680
We all are.

1113
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,600
And it's so hard these days, isn't it?

1114
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Even with modern conveniences like all the dating apps like Hinge and Tinder

1115
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,600
and Grindr, it still can be such a pain in the neck, right?

1116
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,160
Well, I have a solution for you.

1117
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,320
What about taking a vow of celibacy and devoting your whole heart to the character Sebastian

1118
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,440
Jackal, a character that Christopher Lloyd played on the UPN show Deadly Games?

1119
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,480
It aired about 25 years ago and aired for one season.

1120
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,880
So what I'm saying is, admit that no human will ever be on your level

1121
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,800
and that you will worship Sebastian Jackal as a god.

1122
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,080
To get started on your new Jackal-based life, go to patreon.com slash podcast the ride,

1123
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,280
where we offer some episodes for five dollars a month.

1124
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,480
We will be doing a Sebastian Jackal episode next week.

1125
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,720
You can pay us, listen to it, and then acknowledge that the only person in your life should be

1126
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,000
Sebastian Jackal.

1127
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That's patreon.com slash podcast the ride next week.

1128
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,720
Sorry, Cathy Ireland, a person who guest starred on the UPN show Deadly Games.

1129
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,640
My heart belongs to Jackal.

1130
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:07,640
I did read that, you know, it does go faster than some of the other boat rides, kind of set by

1131
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,760
their track.

1132
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,200
You do end up going a little faster than the Twain or the Columbia because you're just going

1133
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,200
at whatever speed everyone's paddling.

1134
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,400
Yes.

1135
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,640
Yes.

1136
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,360
So there's the guy.

1137
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,800
There's not an exact time.

1138
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,000
So I guess if you had a really slow canoe, it could be an hour.

1139
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:23,960
Yeah.

1140
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,680
And some in a situation where like all the people paddling decided to paddle like against

1141
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,200
like to paddle backwards and fight against the guides.

1142
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,520
Then, yes, it would take longer.

1143
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,800
So this is one of those group think kind of things we've talked about.

1144
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,160
You go on the Indiana Jones ride and you get everyone to agree to not look at Mara.

1145
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,480
Right.

1146
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,760
And then what happens?

1147
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,360
Probably the ride continues.

1148
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,000
And it's fine.

1149
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,640
Normally.

1150
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,800
Yes.

1151
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,640
There'd be no way to stop it.

1152
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,720
You'd have to light the vehicle on fire for anything to happen.

1153
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,840
And it would stop right there.

1154
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:01,880
In this case, though, if you did have a group of 20, you may I guess you could get out there

1155
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,880
and then have some secret code.

1156
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,440
Yeah.

1157
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,280
Or just like a group text goes out.

1158
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,800
Everybody feels the vibration.

1159
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,840
No words are said.

1160
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,160
Yeah.

1161
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,360
All of a sudden to the chagrin of the main operators.

1162
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,040
You start going that other way.

1163
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,800
It is interesting.

1164
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,480
I wonder if something like that's ever happened.

1165
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,920
They've been running this forever.

1166
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,040
Did they have an unruly boat like a bachelor party boat or bachelorette party where everyone's

1167
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,800
like, we're going backwards.

1168
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,160
And then they just started paddling back.

1169
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,960
You have the most control.

1170
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,000
It's the ride with the most control to the people on it.

1171
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,960
It is really are.

1172
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,200
And all this live your Star Wars story.

1173
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,440
Yeah.

1174
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,920
But this is the real you are in control.

1175
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,120
The Yippee day, the day Disney was shut down by the Yippee.

1176
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,920
Did the Yippee start to paddle back?

1177
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,520
They brought their own paddles, probably.

1178
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,280
How come you said that?

1179
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,480
And then you were like, oh, yeah.

1180
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,240
And I was like, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1181
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:53,800
Yippee's?

1182
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,320
No, the Yippee day.

1183
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,120
That was like, oh, of course.

1184
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,440
Yes.

1185
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,640
No further explanation needed.

1186
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,280
Let's continue.

1187
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,960
I heard Jim and Len talk about the Yippee.

1188
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,080
Yeah, this is probably worth its own deep dive on it.

1189
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,760
But it was when a bunch of hippies like bought park tickets and just flooded the park.

1190
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,360
And there were just so many of them.

1191
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,120
They like took the park over.

1192
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,400
They like, yeah, it was like a year.

1193
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,000
They did.

1194
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,720
Yeah, they did.

1195
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,440
It was a little burnouts 1970.

1196
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,880
Yippee was more like they were a radical anti-establishment group.

1197
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,760
OK, they were more.

1198
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,040
So they were a little more.

1199
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,760
Yippee's or Mel Yippee's, there's force to it.

1200
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,520
The youths international.

1201
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,880
The youth international party.

1202
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,760
And little did they know when they grew up, they would all become yuppies.

1203
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,920
They would all sell out.

1204
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,520
But they made a big, they took over Disneyland one day.

1205
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,480
It was chaos.

1206
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,360
Then what happened?

1207
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,760
I don't think they did that.

1208
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,440
I don't think they damaged the park that much.

1209
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,960
I think they were just very unruly.

1210
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,760
I think they were unruly.

1211
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,720
I think they just went.

1212
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,560
I think they just shut the park down.

1213
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,080
They basically paddled the canoe backwards.

1214
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,560
Yeah, they just kind of scratched their butts.

1215
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,360
I have not found any evidence for why the yippies were a problem.

1216
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,080
Well, I'm going to have to prove that I'm not an idiot.

1217
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,880
The big Los Angeles magazine story here.

1218
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,920
Atlas Obscura, San Francisco Gate.

1219
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,080
So there's this whole story about how the group of 70s radicals tried and failed to invade Disneyland.

1220
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,960
We'll just find one.

1221
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,680
What's one thing somebody did?

1222
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,920
He spit in Snow White's face.

1223
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,280
They all got naked and swam in the river like a bunch of Chicago youths.

1224
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,320
I don't think there was naked swimming.

1225
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:34,920
They were pranksterish protesters is the phrase this article used.

1226
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,760
Well, that sounds like an improv everywhere.

1227
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,240
It does.

1228
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:44,040
There was a women's liberation rally to liberate Minnie Mouse in front of Fantasyland at noon.

1229
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,640
So they were annoying.

1230
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,560
They were just like, this is too annoying.

1231
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,200
Yeah, that all does sound like early national lampoon or something.

1232
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,240
I don't know that they were, who knows?

1233
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,000
They maybe they had some points.

1234
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,080
I don't know, not about Minnie, I'm just saying.

1235
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,840
We'll get into it at a certain point.

1236
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,400
Well, it led to riot cops on Main Street.

1237
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,120
Oh my God.

1238
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:10,120
So yeah, I mean in California, they call out riot cops if you cough wrong towards the mayor.

1239
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,840
So, you know.

1240
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,340
Yeah.

1241
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,220
We have a couple of bad state.

1242
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,900
We have a couple posted outside the door.

1243
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,180
Yeah, making sure we didn't.

1244
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,740
We don't talk about little red shorts.

1245
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,940
Rick Caruso.

1246
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,700
Rick Caruso is heavies at every podcast network to make sure no one makes fun.

1247
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,300
Right. They're like, you guys like the Americana, but you're not going to vote.

1248
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,060
You're not going to vote for a piece of shit.

1249
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,460
This piece of shit billionaire.

1250
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,820
It doesn't make sense to us.

1251
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,780
There have been unruly incidents, maybe accidental.

1252
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:45,340
Well, this one may have been, well, you know, it depends on who you ask.

1253
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,900
This is, I want to say, circa 1990 in the LA Times.

1254
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,020
Shocking headline.

1255
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,980
15 dumped in drink at Disneyland.

1256
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,460
Mishap.

1257
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,300
No one is injured, but it was total chaos as canoe sank.

1258
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,420
Patrons blame overloading, but park officials cite splashing and rocking by riders.

1259
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,580
So the park is blaming the people.

1260
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:07,980
Yeah.

1261
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,220
But pretty much all the regular folks they talk to.

1262
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,700
Okay, here's quotes.

1263
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,460
This person, I think, was just a rider.

1264
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,140
There was total chaos going on.

1265
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,380
It was comical because they kept saying it won't sink.

1266
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,100
Keep paddling.

1267
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,300
And it sank right there.

1268
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,900
Somebody had to be rescued because they could not swim.

1269
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,300
I would say maybe don't go on the canoe ride.

1270
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,500
If you can't swim.

1271
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,020
They have life vests.

1272
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,540
I think all children have to wear life vests and they're available for adults.

1273
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,980
If you aren't comfortable.

1274
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,700
Oh, yes, you could.

1275
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,460
Because I saw a parent putting on a life vest.

1276
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,780
Yeah.

1277
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,980
That if anything happens.

1278
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,460
I'm a little surprised they don't make.

1279
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,580
I am too.

1280
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:45,900
Yeah.

1281
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,980
You would think this is for Disney safety.

1282
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,060
Yeah.

1283
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,820
You would think they would make you wear a vest.

1284
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,340
Well, check this out.

1285
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,900
In this article, weird little specific.

1286
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,100
This is a legal issue.

1287
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:03,660
This article got a quote from a spokesman for the US Coast Guard who said,

1288
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,140
There's a federal requirement that all boats must carry flotation devices,

1289
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:14,540
but it does not apply on private waterways, including those in amusement parks.

1290
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,100
Wow, really?

1291
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,460
This has been regulated.

1292
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,020
Yeah.

1293
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:23,260
So like anywhere else, because, yeah, you go on certain, you know, just like little day cruises

1294
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,700
and you got to put one of the or they need to put them on, but they have them.

1295
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,500
But they wouldn't have room in that canoe, probably.

1296
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,060
Right.

1297
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:33,900
So, yeah, Disney with their own private waterways.

1298
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,460
And hopefully this is one of those things that DeSantis gets in there and makes right.

1299
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,540
Finally, Disney's been.

1300
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,300
Well, he got rid of it before.

1301
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,740
I was going to say it doesn't.

1302
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,380
DeSantis want less, less regular life jacket regulation.

1303
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:53,100
So, yeah, but in Disney's case, you want more.

1304
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,020
It's hard to square the circle for him, but I'm sure he'll figure it out how.

1305
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,260
Yeah.

1306
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,700
So so once whatever creates the most chaos, he is the Joker, folks.

1307
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,460
Look, I'm just going to say if you vote for this guy in the net,

1308
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,340
you're literally voting for the joke as we put it in terms.

1309
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,340
You can understand you pee brains.

1310
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,860
He is as smart or Joker, Governor Joker, President Joker.

1311
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,540
We had a governor that we was fun.

1312
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,300
He was a pumper and a popper.

1313
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,180
But this we don't want to go joke on her.

1314
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:25,820
Gov joke.

1315
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:31,180
No. But so what you're saying really is that there might have been a scenario

1316
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,940
where you had to wear a life jacket on the Mark Twain, which is which is the boat.

1317
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,780
You don't have like nobody or anything.

1318
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,860
They had to like have them.

1319
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,780
They had to have them on there.

1320
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,260
I see.

1321
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,740
But I don't know, depending on further restriction.

1322
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:43,980
Right.

1323
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,620
Again, if DeSantis gets his way, then maybe then, you know, some little ragtime band is

1324
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,060
playing on there for the finale of Fantasmic.

1325
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,660
All the characters are you got to fit big life vests.

1326
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,940
Or water wings, maybe.

1327
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,220
And oh, a little kid swimmer.

1328
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,620
Sanis will make you on a water ride where water wings and that's going to slow everything

1329
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,100
down.

1330
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,860
It's going to cost Disney so much money to get water wings.

1331
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,860
What they deserve or not really doing anything about the thing that came up.

1332
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:17,180
And he's also going to make everybody wear a certain set of little red shorts before

1333
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,140
they get on a water ride.

1334
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,380
OK.

1335
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,500
And he's going to have them in a big bag and he's going to have people that collect them.

1336
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,300
And you have to wash them.

1337
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
That's going to be more infrastructure that Disney doesn't have.

1338
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,940
The good old days are back.

1339
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,700
The good old days are here again.

1340
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:28,940
Yeah.

1341
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:29,900
Yes.

1342
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,340
Means little shorts.

1343
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,980
Did you guys watch any of the footage from Shanghai, Disneyland?

1344
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,660
I briefly.

1345
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,140
Yeah.

1346
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,540
Yeah.

1347
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:44,300
Where like they have the canoes, but you go through, you go buy a lot of fake rocks,

1348
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,980
a lot of good fake rocks around here.

1349
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:51,660
That's a lot of like ships, a lot of pieces of pirate ships and stuff.

1350
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,820
There is a little more adventure because the area is Adventure Isle,

1351
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,860
which is more and Treasure Cove.

1352
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,900
So you're going by pirate ships because they're a little more

1353
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,580
Pirates of the Caribbean centric there.

1354
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,780
They've got that big ride.

1355
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,420
So we're not.

1356
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:16,140
Do they maybe not even have a frontier western zone at all in Shanghai?

1357
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:16,940
Am I crazy?

1358
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,500
I don't remember.

1359
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,380
Yeah, no, it's not.

1360
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,660
The land's changed a little bit.

1361
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,260
They don't really care about the old Mississippi.

1362
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,060
It's not the American West.

1363
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,100
Yeah, as we talked about, we did an episode on that, right?

1364
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,220
What?

1365
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,180
On Frontierland?

1366
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,820
West?

1367
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,220
We did it.

1368
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:30,380
Yeah.

1369
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,940
Frontierland.

1370
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1371
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,020
And we were talking about in there was like, that's not, you're never going to build this again.

1372
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,580
Yeah, yeah.

1373
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,460
There's not, there's not, there's not been new IP.

1374
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:38,700
Yeah.

1375
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:45,180
Lens itself to really making new interest in the and Woody from Toy Story can only do so much.

1376
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,940
He's already not really, he's not a real cowboy like

1377
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,740
Davy Crockett.

1378
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:51,980
Yeah.

1379
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,220
So you can't just woody-ify all of it.

1380
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,980
Yeah, and the Lone Ranger was not a hit.

1381
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,500
So I think that's not happening.

1382
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,460
We'll see how this all plays out, but maybe Johnny gets another chance.

1383
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,700
Oh yeah, I think that's going to happen for sure.

1384
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,100
I think for sure.

1385
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,980
The relationship with Amber is really, I think it cost me Lone Ranger too.

1386
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,940
Just PR team.

1387
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,740
I think it was set to go.

1388
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,780
PR team's doing their best.

1389
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,300
Well, the movie, the Lone Ranger was years ago still, we were talking about it.

1390
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,500
I had a Zoom.

1391
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,780
Johnny, what happened to your business part who mysteriously disappeared?

1392
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,300
One thing at a time.

1393
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,260
We're talking about Amber.

1394
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:27,660
Okay.

1395
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,820
He pooped in my bed.

1396
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,300
Can't say what happens after that.

1397
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,580
Really good impression of Johnny Depp.

1398
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,700
I will say this though, you're doing it about 10 times too fast.

1399
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,500
Oh, I see.

1400
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,660
It's maybe the slowest I've ever heard someone talk during those videos.

1401
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,700
Smiling bunch.

1402
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,180
But it's not frontier.

1403
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,860
He he he I have to do.

1404
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,140
Oh God.

1405
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,540
It's too real.

1406
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,620
Did he say he he he out loud?

1407
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,340
That's too real.

1408
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,380
I don't know that it happened.

1409
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,980
I'm not, I try not to watch a lot of this.

1410
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,100
It's all so grotesque.

1411
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,220
For the video, I got to blow my nose, right?

1412
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,580
Just let me blow my nose.

1413
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,820
His PR team really is working very hard.

1414
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,860
They got the bots.

1415
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,820
They got the Twitter bots.

1416
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,700
They have the bots.

1417
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,180
They've got half the theme park news media.

1418
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,700
We're already in the bag for them.

1419
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,180
That's true.

1420
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,540
Yes, that is true.

1421
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,020
Those people were bought and paid for years ago.

1422
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,460
What?

1423
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,580
Oh, now here's another thing.

1424
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:32,460
This is another like 90s news article that involved this attraction.

1425
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,660
But it starts with another one, which is the Jungle Cruise.

1426
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,460
And I talked about how they changed.

1427
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,820
This was 100% Navajo run.

1428
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,420
And they dismantled the Indian area.

1429
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,020
So it became all right.

1430
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,900
But still just men.

1431
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,180
There were not female canoeists.

1432
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,380
Oh, that's a good question.

1433
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,100
Couldn't tell you.

1434
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,900
Canoeers.

1435
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,900
But I don't think I realized that until the mid-90s, there was a lot of gender segregation

1436
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,100
in terms of hiring on these attractions.

1437
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,220
And the Jungle Cruise was the thing that dismantled it.

1438
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,580
There was a woman named Suzanne Barnaby.

1439
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,580
She was an Adventureland ride operator who'd worked there for 15 years

1440
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:21,100
and was just always told, no, you can't be a Jungle Cruise skipper.

1441
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,140
Didn't understand why exactly.

1442
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:28,460
Then took a trip to Disney World where there were just women doing it.

1443
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,020
And there was never any big stink.

1444
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,060
There was no policy.

1445
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:36,620
It was just like whenever they started in the 70s and just never instituted that.

1446
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,300
So it never had to be dismantled.

1447
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,140
So she came back to work and was like, she went to Disney World and there were women doing it.

1448
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,700
Can I do it?

1449
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,300
Yeah.

1450
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,300
And then she was doing it four days later.

1451
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,380
And then they started dismantling that all over.

1452
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,420
And I didn't realize there was a...

1453
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,620
I don't think we've talked about this in the show.

1454
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:56,940
There was a ton of that apparently that storybook land, canal boat operators,

1455
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,060
the people like telling, pointing out what all the little miniatures are.

1456
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,740
That was all women.

1457
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,220
But Jungle Cruise is only men with his other ones.

1458
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:05,660
I didn't know that.

1459
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:10,060
Because in this article, soon female conductors will be working the Main Street Omnibus

1460
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:14,540
and Disneyland Railroad and female sailors will be on the Columbia and Mark Twain.

1461
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,380
There were only men on all of these attractions till the 90s.

1462
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:19,820
Why in the world?

1463
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,820
Yeah, I did not know that.

1464
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:26,220
And like a lot of things as you go back through history, you go, that makes no sense.

1465
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,580
Really fucking dumb.

1466
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,380
I credit it.

1467
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,340
At least they like as soon as anyone said one thing about it, they changed it.

1468
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,380
Well, pointed out.

1469
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,180
Yeah.

1470
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,540
I believe both are cast members and Arca New were women.

1471
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:38,860
Yes.

1472
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,180
Yeah.

1473
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,660
Yeah.

1474
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:39,900
True.

1475
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:46,300
Another bit of that is that they're talking about, well, why did it come to be this way?

1476
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,620
Why was it only men in the Jungle Cruise for so long?

1477
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,780
And then here's a little snippet from this article.

1478
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,700
Disneyland had experimented with the notion of female jungle guides before.

1479
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,660
Some worked during the summer of 1974.

1480
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:04,300
But a spokesman for the park said at the time that the public was not ready to accept women daredevils.

1481
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:05,500
What?

1482
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,540
Daredevils?

1483
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:13,180
Meaning the jungle, the people who fake shoot at a hippo and tell a bunch of bad jokes,

1484
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,540
those are daredevils?

1485
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,580
Yeah, I guess that's a yeah, that doesn't I don't know.

1486
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,220
It was a word different words used to be different sometimes.

1487
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,980
You know, words often were different.

1488
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,700
I'd like to think we've come a long way, but then you watch a Jungle Cruise movie and

1489
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,340
there's a lot of jokes in there about like and women are doing it for themselves.

1490
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,540
Like there's a lot of.

1491
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,380
It's you're talking about.

1492
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:35,900
Yeah.

1493
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:42,140
Well, there were women there like were there that was when the evil can evil start 70s.

1494
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,820
My question here is, yeah, is this a daredevil centric time?

1495
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,580
What with evil can evil?

1496
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,380
We have the nation at evil can evil fever.

1497
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:56,620
American icon like there were no daredevils as far as I know.

1498
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:01,580
I don't know the history of daredevils, but we had the most prominent daredevil in history

1499
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,620
and he's male, so nobody could square the idea.

1500
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:04,860
Yeah.

1501
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:11,900
Female daredevil, much less a female standing in a slow moving boat on a track and telling

1502
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:19,020
an occasional they can't suspend their can evil and his daredevils debuted on January 3rd, 1966.

1503
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,460
So you they burst through in a big American flag paper.

1504
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,700
He had like how's your daredevils now?

1505
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,500
Was he how do I say this without slandering?

1506
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,340
I just can't slander the dead.

1507
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,300
Wasn't he shitty?

1508
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,340
Wasn't he a shitty guy?

1509
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,940
Evil can evil wasn't he like that's probably right.

1510
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,460
I gotta look up people can evils by asking the question.

1511
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,780
I think a question can't be slander.

1512
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,740
A question can a question be slander.

1513
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,700
Can a question be slander?

1514
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,580
That's a good question.

1515
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,660
Any of these questions.

1516
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:52,460
I like Jason.

1517
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,300
I think you can separate the stunts from the performer, you know?

1518
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:01,900
So I'd like to not think that I'd like to not remember evil for any of his badness.

1519
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,300
I think evil was didn't hurt people.

1520
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,020
If the stunts didn't the stunts only hurt evil.

1521
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,180
Yeah, I think mostly evil got hurt.

1522
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,380
Yeah, I'm gonna jump.

1523
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,460
Was evil evil is Jason asking?

1524
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:18,540
Yeah, I'm gonna jump over 50 children but land on a remaining set of 50 children

1525
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,380
who are right after the 50 I'm jumping.

1526
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:25,420
I remember on Fox a lot and maybe it wasn't a lot but I remember on Fox when I was a kid

1527
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,780
that Robbie can evil would often be doing a jump of some kind.

1528
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,900
Yeah, yeah, they were a lot.

1529
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,100
There was a lot of big hokey primetime specials which I enjoyed.

1530
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:38,380
Which Robbie really you can't use a real name after your dad's name was evil.

1531
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,180
You can't just go like I'm Robbie.

1532
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:47,180
You have to like demonic can evil like something even crazy or something even darker.

1533
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:47,980
Prime evil.

1534
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,420
Perfect.

1535
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,780
He's caveman themed.

1536
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,580
Even evil junior would be better.

1537
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,180
It's cute but it's better.

1538
01:04:55,180 --> 01:05:02,060
Is it the kind of juvenile Robbie which Robert can evil be better?

1539
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,060
That seems more like he should be in a suit.

1540
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,780
My name is Robert to Knievel.

1541
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:10,140
I'm here to jump a bike over some school buses.

1542
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,660
Which way to your school buses please.

1543
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:14,940
There's Robert.

1544
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:22,540
So yeah daredevils I mean Walt Disney was such a weirdo conservative that I'm sure that

1545
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:27,820
like yes the jungle cruise was a dangerous ride and for their safety.

1546
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,980
It's for the safety but don't want to mess up their hair.

1547
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,420
Is it also maybe that they were just like well women don't what did he have like a

1548
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:39,740
Jerry Lewis impression that women weren't funny and like they can't pull off the

1549
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:44,060
jokes on the jungle cruise that are so integral to the whole experience.

1550
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,260
There's no way a woman would be able to joke with the guests.

1551
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,380
There's just no way.

1552
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:54,300
Maybe or he was gonna he like mentioned it casually to Jerry Lewis at dinner who convinced him.

1553
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,780
Oh very possible yeah they were at the Tam and

1554
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,700
serious women can't do the jokes.

1555
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,580
That's why Jerry I can't do the jokes on the cruise.

1556
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,060
It's not gonna work.

1557
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,540
There's a dare for daredevils.

1558
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:12,460
Your impression is that he has like elbows with his hands and shifts them around.

1559
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,820
I've never seen a Jerry Lewis movie who cares never meant shit to me.

1560
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,420
No jokes though because that's something I didn't realize.

1561
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,660
I think there may have been a maybe not a full policy change in this attraction but

1562
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:30,620
my memory of it is closer to your memory Jason where it was a guy who was very driving and

1563
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:35,820
like do not stop keep going keep going and it seemed it was kind of like an oppressive

1564
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:41,020
not fun experience but this it's leisurely you're taking your little breaks and even as

1565
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,540
you're canoeing you're getting little jokes.

1566
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,140
I didn't know that it was a joke based attraction.

1567
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:51,260
Yeah I really enjoyed the jokes I wrote down some of them but do you remember them off hand.

1568
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,420
Well if it did any would strike your fancy.

1569
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:58,540
I remember this attraction where they could be a little mean to you like they can tease you a little.

1570
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:05,020
And I saw in the videos and I remember I don't remember the context when we were there there

1571
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:09,900
were jokes about it being and of course we're in Orange County and I was like what do you mean by

1572
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,400
that.

1573
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
I don't remember the context of those either.

1574
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,520
Like in the video they're like the people are judging the people on the island are judging

1575
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,960
us if you're not going fast enough after all this is Orange County and I'm like hey man Orange

1576
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,880
County is massive and very weird like it could be any number of things you could be implying.

1577
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,640
You're not sure what they mean.

1578
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,040
I feel like that was a joke for herself like she was like she knew what she meant and probably

1579
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:39,760
got some enjoyment whether she was trashing Orange County or saying something funny about it.

1580
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,960
I'm not sure.

1581
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:50,160
My favorite of the jokes was towards the end she says hey put your hands up if you picked this ride.

1582
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,320
Yes.

1583
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,360
A couple people did that and then she said now you know who doesn't get to pick the next ride.

1584
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,880
That's funny.

1585
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,240
It is funny this is one of those rides where and Jungle Cruise has sort of evolved into it more

1586
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:13,360
where decades of apathy have turned the jokes into isn't this thing bad that we're doing.

1587
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:13,840
Yeah.

1588
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,280
And it happened to Jungle Cruise.

1589
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,480
We're off in the corner.

1590
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,400
New hot attractions have surpassed us.

1591
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:20,800
Yes.

1592
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,560
Which is a funny angle.

1593
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,040
It is funny.

1594
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,640
For anything to come from.

1595
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,480
But it's like it's definitely like floating under the radar of what you know corporate

1596
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,880
Disney would want for a ride.

1597
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,920
It would want to be exciting and you're living your adventure and you know everybody's got a role.

1598
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,640
That's all that language about any new Star Wars thing or Marvel thing.

1599
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,920
You're the superhero and now this one is like doesn't this suck.

1600
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,640
Hey who picked this?

1601
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,000
This sucks doesn't it.

1602
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,600
You're all rowing now you're using your arms.

1603
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,080
You got a new work.

1604
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,520
Yeah you shitheads.

1605
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,880
What do you think in doing this?

1606
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,600
This is stupid.

1607
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,160
Why are we here?

1608
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:54,960
I like it.

1609
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,600
It's this little like.

1610
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,320
Which is funny.

1611
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,080
Aggravated it's this like mad younger brother of an attraction.

1612
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,400
I like it.

1613
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,400
It's spirited you can tell.

1614
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:11,040
I'm sure there's camaraderie with the guides like it's got to be this fun little.

1615
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,480
Well there's flexibility.

1616
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,560
I don't mean to say fraternity because there's a lot of women doing it but.

1617
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,160
Yeah it's a fun fun.

1618
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,680
I bet it's a fun little club like being a lifeguard for the summer or something.

1619
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,960
Yes I think it's a fun club.

1620
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,920
Jungle Cruise is a little bit more restrictive because you do have to do

1621
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,160
a lot of the same jokes and the same like banter.

1622
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,160
But we've all seen different people.

1623
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,160
Some people I've seen who do the jokes and it's really like kind of cringy.

1624
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,720
And some people I think have figured it out.

1625
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:41,040
But the people I've liked the most doing Jungle Cruise lately are people like this.

1626
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,000
Who have figured out how to do it very dry and flat and like no one's listening.

1627
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,520
No one's paying attention because that's the tone of the person we got on the canoes.

1628
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,880
And oftentimes are the people I like on Jungle Cruise which is a little depressing.

1629
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,120
But it's the tone of who cares?

1630
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,080
Are you paying attention to me?

1631
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,720
No you're not?

1632
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,800
Okay like that's that works for both of these rides at this point.

1633
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,480
It's like sardonic snarky in a way that would work for a stand up.

1634
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,680
Where I genuinely did laugh at a bunch of...

1635
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,000
Yes.

1636
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah she's roasting other people on other rides and like you pass by.

1637
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,360
That's a cool thing about it that you go right by where the point in the river where the splash

1638
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,360
mountain logs dump out.

1639
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:25,440
So you can be right at the like you watch one coming at you essentially.

1640
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:25,760
Yes.

1641
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,040
Right on its level.

1642
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,960
So that's a fun vantage point.

1643
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:35,760
It is the ultimate Disney Disneyland nerd thing to be like we got to see the log coming from a

1644
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,480
different angle that we've never seen before.

1645
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,160
You know the log you've seen a million times.

1646
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,240
Well what if you saw it from a different angle?

1647
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,600
And I agree I'm not I'm one of the guys who like oh look at the log.

1648
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,320
Oh wow.

1649
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,120
Look at the log.

1650
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,280
I can see the log from a different vantage point.

1651
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,360
Yeah yes a new camera angle got added.

1652
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,040
In this case she said over there is splash mountain.

1653
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:02,160
That's a ride where people come off of it upset because they were splashed on a ride called

1654
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,680
splash mountain.

1655
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,600
She's roasting the kinds of people get mad on that.

1656
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,480
I like the other one you pass by the haunted mansion.

1657
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,640
You want to hear a joke about the haunted mansion?

1658
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,920
Long silence.

1659
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,880
That's the spirit.

1660
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,720
And then that's it and that's a little creeper.

1661
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,240
I didn't even get it for a second.

1662
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,960
You took a second.

1663
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,120
Yeah.

1664
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,920
Uh huh.

1665
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,200
This one yeah I wonder we I guess we should have gone on multiple times because I wonder if like

1666
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,280
is it true freedom?

1667
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,800
Can you do a tight nine?

1668
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,280
You develop your own tight nine on the canoes and you don't have much oversight.

1669
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:35,520
Yeah.

1670
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,920
Because that's how it feels because the time I went on it a couple years ago it was totally

1671
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,400
different.

1672
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,480
Person was like making few jokes but not like this.

1673
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,640
This was this was joke a joke a minute.

1674
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,920
I saw the one video I watched there was a joke along the lines of like they were about halfway

1675
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,560
through the ride and they're like all right everyone we're going to start paddling some

1676
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,960
more put your paddles up in the air on three we're going to put them in the water A B C

1677
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,480
and everyone put it in the water and they went no I that's fine that's a solid that's an easy

1678
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,120
that's good and that's fine that's that's true listening yeah if you just say something in the

1679
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,080
pattern of one two three A B C like yeah that's good that's great that's good so yeah it does

1680
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,480
feel like you can have your own comedic like comedic persona yeah when you're doing the

1681
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,840
canoes so you could do your Andy Kaufman-esque comedy you can do straight ahead Leno style

1682
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,160
stand-up you could do anything you wanted which seems like that's maybe this is the one this is

1683
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:33,680
the position with the most freedom yeah to play a character in the park and if the guests don't

1684
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:40,000
like it the cast members are jacked and can shove them in a locker that's right yeah nerd yes you

1685
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,960
have to you will be jacked after two weeks of doing this I wonder if they ask you before or it's just

1686
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,080
you get jacked doing it I don't do they say can you do the bent arm hang how many seconds can you

1687
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,040
how many seconds are you ready to pump are you hot can you pump and then even but even that maybe

1688
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,440
that doesn't matter and they're just like you'll get there you'll get there after a week of doing

1689
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,880
this I think they've I think they lose people quickly I've read that they lose people just

1690
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,240
during the you mean during one of your you mean they quit not that they fall into the water

1691
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,600
no not not literally they lose track of them yeah people because they have to they do it for a while

1692
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,760
they get like the hulk where they can punch the ground and like launch themselves and they just

1693
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,880
don't see them again they just fly out of the parks yeah straight into the sky sure that's an

1694
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:32,240
exciting way to quit um another fun thing about this I didn't know that they did canoe races yes

1695
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:40,320
and this is not just the employees of this attraction it's all over the teams from all

1696
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,520
over the park get together hundreds of I found a recent one I don't think they've been doing it

1697
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:53,280
maybe in COVID era I'm not sure but at least in 2019 they did it with 144 teams so like you gather

1698
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:59,120
everybody in your little attraction unit and uh head down there and see how fast you can get your

1699
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:05,360
canoe all the way around the rivers of America yeah very fun it does seem fun I I would like to

1700
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:12,320
be in a canoe more yeah that's what struck me absolutely like I enjoyed it I would race I

1701
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,640
would like to race yeah sure I get a competitive spirit from time to time you might be able to

1702
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:23,360
because it seems like it's more about teamwork and 20 people functioning as one right than it is about

1703
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,400
having a lot of previous canoe knowledge because you'd think it would be a given who's going to

1704
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,880
win the canoe race the people who work on the canoes right but look they're used to their

1705

1706
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,800

1720
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,240
with Josh tomorrow what we know about this no you may look it's not the most produced thing in

1721
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,520
the world because Instagram stories you know you can't exactly make a little package there

1722
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,120
right save it save the story yep you can go to Josh tomorrow's Instagram and it's yeah it's one

1723
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:35,040
of those little circles that's uh that's backlogged yeah so if you want to watch uh daddy tomorrow uh

1724
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:40,880
pump and paddle so what are you watching this for maybe you're not watching it what are you

1725
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:47,440
listening to it for so this is recent the last like five or six years or so this was 2019 2019

1726
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,320
like as recently as they were doing it and just pure stats by the way because i don't know i have

1727
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:57,680
no way to measure my guess is that a typical i think we were on this for like nine minutes i

1728
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:03,760
could be wrong maybe it was longer i'm not sure uh i think i think the the record the all-time record

1729
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,160
for canoe racing was broken in 2019 three minutes and 33 seconds one lap yeah really

1730
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,800
that seems fast right that seems very fast typically and this has been going since the

1731
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,920
60s they've done this for a long time i think typically you're in the four to five minute

1732
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,600
range but there's a really yeah that one like wow iterated the record i think so whatever team that

1733
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:30,160
was it was not josh tomorrow's team one and done that was the name of the team yeah one spelled

1734
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:36,080
like you you how do you get how do you get on his team i want to know that sure uh what what view do

1735
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:43,120

1736
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:48,480

1751
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:18,480
i'm a tall man surprise i have zero idea if i can call for a josh demaro photo and then see one

1752
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:23,600
but you at home can you can google it whenever you should i should say mike was a good sport because

1753
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:32,480
i was uh it was fine in the boat and i liked paddling getting in the boat my i had a backpack

1754
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:38,240
on and the paddle and the boat was drifting like just far enough from the dock where i was like

1755
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:45,360
i don't i'm gonna fall in this fucking water like i was just my balance was so so like i grabbed

1756
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:50,160
mike's hand mike's hand was up and i don't know if he was intending to help me into the boat but

1757
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,880
he certainly did i was absolutely intending to help you in the book i said oh my god jason's

1758
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:00,720
about to fall in the fucking water oh my god yes look i was i don't wish that it happened but a

1759
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:06,480
man i know right if you fell in the water if you had and you can swim like you you should have at

1760
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,960
that point mate like you should have just sort of swimming like over to tom sloan's island or

1761
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,840
something to try to like get away just because it would be content at that point people diving in

1762
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:22,400
after you like a big swim race going on well halfway through i mean that that would was going

1763
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,560
to be one of my plus ups is having the option that halfway through the boat starts to sink

1764
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:33,040
and you all have to swim swim you all have to manage i think tom's island will be better

1765
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,960
story wise because you could take the raft over and then after you are on the island for a while

1766
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,920
you come back and the raft has been dismantled and they're like oh tom and huck were here and

1767
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,440
they took your raft apart those little scamps and then you all have to build the raft back

1768
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:56,960
to build your own way yeah that's fun they took it apart they like baseball bats to it

1769
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,160
they they were just they were just goofing you know they were just goofing on your raft

1770
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,480
so well you know that would be better in like a scenario where people we are were aware so

1771
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:12,080
they were wearing bathing suits or something yeah you know but that is a fun if it's like a

1772
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,600
if suit truly oh no something's gone wrong and now it's now we're sinking and now we have to get

1773
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:23,840
out and paddle not paddle paddle with our arms away yeah not with actual paddles or like you

1774
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,880
just grab a barrel like you use the barrel to float maybe that'll help you move right and then

1775
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,160
you bring it up and then you use it as um clothes after when you're on land put the straps on it

1776
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:38,800
that was my weird swimming experience and forgive me if i brought this up before but like a boy scout

1777
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,960
camp they for the swimming merit badge one of the things involved you had to jump in with clothes on

1778
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:50,080
yeah oh i had to do this flotation stuff like you so if you have it first off they're like the easiest

1779
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:55,760
way to do this if you have like slacks and a button-up shirt and i'm like so i'm like on a

1780
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:02,240
business casual cruise like why would i wear this you're like james bond jumping off of a super

1781
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:07,760
villain's yacht so so a button-up shirt you can like kind of untuck it and you can force water

1782
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:14,400
into it so it kind of makes a de facto life vest and then if you take your like a long pair of

1783
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,920
long pants off tie the legs together put that over your head like a life thing and then you force

1784
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:26,000
air and water into that that becomes an even more supportive thing yeah i had to do this for swim

1785
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,040
class to complete like the last level of swim class and yeah i don't think i had to wear like a

1786
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,560
tux or anything but i were like i think i wore like snap off pants or something which is really

1787
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:42,720
cheating right if i think about it we're like breakaway that like a yeah you'd wear in a sketch

1788
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:48,560
or a or a male stripper would you didn't have breakaway pants did not have no what you know

1789
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,080
why would i have breakaway pants it's for like basketball season yeah i know what he's talking

1790
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,640
to me you mean where you take the pants the bottoms off and then they are no no they have track pants

1791
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,480
the sides have like snaps on them and you take them off like for for basketball or something i

1792
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:07,040
wasn't a little male stripper here we go like that's not yeah that was for first

1793
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:13,840
boards a quick reveal your little red shorts yeah no it was not for a big reveal it was for

1794
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,240
it gets winter and you want to wear your basketball shorts not leather and not little like leather

1795
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:24,160
like there was no coming off of it no leather flare when i was in seventh grade that was not

1796
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:29,760
the situation but figuring out the kind of pants we're talking about um one more little thing you

1797
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:37,760
guys asked me on the way out to note an important yes yes detail and i did do my homework about this

1798
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,880
and that is i think it's kind of neat that you are handed a paddle you are entrusted with this paddle

1799
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,800
i like them you're given a little job you have to use this and then hand it back at the end of the

1800
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:56,160
attraction and in this case uh we were struck by the detail that the brand of the paddle is listed

1801
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:02,400
on the back so i took a photo and i did my research last night the pad the official paddle company

1802
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:09,440
of disneyland is bending branches you can buy bending branches paddles at home you can buy them

1803
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:16,800
at rei the co-op uh they are a midwest company founded by dale kicker and ron holtman uh dale

1804
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:22,880
and ron uh developed in wisconsin they developed a tip protection material called rock guard in the

1805
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,760
early 80s and that set them apart from other paddle makers great in the business uh but here

1806
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,280
i am going to ask for if we if we do have this photo prepared brett uh because this one this one's

1807
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:38,320
important if there's a photo of a guy paddling who is not one of the three of us if you could pull

1808
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:45,600
that up uh that's no that's me jason no all right and that's all right this is uh this is ed vader

1809
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,760
ed vader is the uh president of bending branches and i think he's very well regarded uh some fun

1810
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:58,240
promotional materials ed vader seems like this is ed vader like darth vader uh we've spelled with a

1811
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:04,160
t but yes okay because i thought it was a robbie keneval situation it's darth vader luke skywalker's

1812
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:10,800
brother world is much nicer son ed vader my name's ed vader um and you know what it's funny this i

1813
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,680
feel like we caused this by by addressing it or thinking about it ed vader has been the president

1814
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:21,120
for a long time but he's uh as of a couple months ago we're finally retiring after a storied career

1815
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:27,440
as a paddle president and ceo so we just with looking on the smiling face we had podcast the

1816
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:33,200
ride want to officially which it wish ed vader a happy retirement thank you you changed the disney

1817
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:38,080
land experience i love thank you your paddles this is a solid wooden paddle the boats of course are

1818
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:45,760
fiberglass making them a little lighter than like a wooden canoe sure sure oh ed yeah look at it now

1819
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,920
he's sailing off to freedom he's got his whole life ahead of him now but something tells me that

1820
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:56,640
even though canoes became his line of work i don't think he's gonna give it i think it's gonna be

1821
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:02,800
part of his retirement year too you can't you can take the paddle company away from the man but you

1822
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:11,280
can't take the paddle out of the hand of the paddle company man well said i need to take a break

1823
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:21,040
in one perfectly said uh i rehearsed for hours yeah i really needed that to go we can do a take two if

1825
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:31,120
um they should do more like they should have the paddle company advertising over the davy

but all but they but bending branches and ed vader and therefore dale kicker and ron holtman

1829
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:56,000

1831
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,680
retirement second gate covering ed vader's retirement party which hopefully we're invited

1832
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:13,040
to now by bringing it up thanks for everything ed uh anything else you want to say about this i

1833
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:18,480
had a great time on the canoes and you know what i might throw this in the rotation of i'm down

1834
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,400
there solo i don't feel like waiting a lot of lines i just want to do something see a lot of stuff

1835
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,360
at the park i don't i don't know i think i'm popping down to that canoe a lot more i mean i

1836
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:36,160
think all the rivers of america are nice options for the mark twain the sailing ship columbia

1837
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:45,360
less so the rafts to whatever it's called pirates layer at tomsore island you know you just go back

1838
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,360
so that's utilitarian yeah that's just for getting getting there yeah it's it is good i do i did feel

1839
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,960
like oh yeah i should do this a little more often i am i'm interested to see the different types of

1840
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,240
experiences versus when you have a different guide or a different paddler or whatever um where

1841
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,960
yeah will we get an aggressive one where they're trying to beat some sort of record was it or is

1842
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:11,280
it all fun jokes yeah so i would like to do it more um experience the variety yeah experience

1843
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,960
they don't have to this is a very it's a completely analog attraction it's not like indiana jones they

1844
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:22,160
didn't need to make a computer no figure out how to make your attraction your experience different

1845
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:28,480
every time it just will be because of the elements yeah nature and human nature it'll be different

1846
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,760
every time yes um i'm realizing now when when when i hear the word paddle and i don't know why i

1847
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,480
didn't think about this until just now i was in a eighth grade play real quick this is at the end

1848
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,960
of the episode i know it's coming too late eighth grade play we talked about sicko plays like your

1849
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,960
swim class shit right not one of my sicko plays just a regular just a regular junior high play the

1850
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:54,800
first play i was ever in was called crazy camp and it was one of those where they just stuff 32

1851
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,640
characters in a play so we can get as many kids on stage as possible like made this up on the spot

1852
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,360
yeah are you looking at crazy camp crazy yeah i'm looking up crazy by the rights and it is of course

1853
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:10,480
a pioneer drama production yeah many of the plays that i did the one that has like 30 speaking

1854
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:15,360
30 speaking roles and i was the camp inspector and i i'm trying to remember if the character

1855
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:21,440
was like mr twilliger or something or am i thinking of a simpsons reference but it might

1856
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:26,400
have been the same but i decided when i auditioned i decided to put an english accent on it which was

1857
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,760
i'm sure terrible i'm sure it was not i don't know if there's a video of this but my character got

1858
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:38,480
lost a lot because the kids would fuck with him and the catch phrase i had in the play was i would

1859
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,760
be like my hair was messed up and i'd come out and be like i lost my paddle and this was a big thing

1860
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:50,160
and this by the way killed this is my first memory of in a real place killing with the line

1861
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:56,080
i've lost my paddle and whatever my bad english accent was with at the time and then once this

1862
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:03,760
happened my friends would use it to make fun of me for years including probably recent fairly

1863
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:13,680
recently too so i'm just remembering now the word paddle is triggered memory well of doing crazy

1864
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:20,560
camp the thing i think is to reclaim it and make it yours yeah if you were ever if you ever felt

1865
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:25,200
like well i think initially you were being left with then you're being left at it's time for you

1866
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,160
to bring the character back and be left with again now it seems like if i'm assessing this

1867
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:36,160
correctly that it was kind of a burst in energy like suddenly you show up something's going on

1868
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:44,720
and then you come in all of flustered and say i lost my battle okay so maybe i'm gonna do the end

1869
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:50,400
of show plugs and if you could and i think use the video i was gonna say the camera now so i think

1870
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:55,520
maybe find a spot where you're out of frame and so this will be a list this will be a video

1871
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,640
exclusive but you'll get the sorry while we're getting set mike were you adam apple or were you

1872
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:06,000
willard because i'm looking at the cast list i was not either of those characters but i do

1873
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,480
