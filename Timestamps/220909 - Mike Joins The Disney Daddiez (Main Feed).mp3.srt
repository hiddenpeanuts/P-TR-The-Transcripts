1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Warning, the following podcast contains exclusive hospital merch.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,520
Shasta Cola, a baby that is not Aladar, and a long queue to have a meet and greet with

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
my first born child.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,640
Today, I officially become a Disney daddy on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where today I, Mike Carlson, am very excited to announce

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,520
a major addition to my home.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm of course talking about a fridge pack of mini cans of the new Coca-Cola flavored Dream

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
World.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm very excited.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,520
It's a delicious new flavor.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,600
Joining me as always Scott Gardner.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,120
God, it's beautiful.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,760
You just look at that and you realize how precious life can be.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,920
Oh boy, that's a miracle, the can that you're putting up to the Zoom window.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
I agree.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Jason Sheridan is also here.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,400
Yeah, and hey, we've all got big news.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,840
Yes, that is me in a Hulu commercial.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
Thank you all for catching it.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Could not wait.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,520
I got to slide it in before we get into the baby.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,840
Okay, I only got a brief window.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,960
I got to get the ad out.

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,920
Probably the only thing really going on for any of us.

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,400
Well, hey, past guest, Johnny Gargano returned to WWE and that's, you know, basically been

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,560
this summer.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
That's it.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
That's all we've got.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
That's it.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,080
No, I, Lindsay K-Tie and I had a baby.

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,220
She had the baby, but we have it together.

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,220
It's ours.

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,220
Wow.

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Past guest, Lindsay K-Tie.

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,220
Multiple, yeah.

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,640
Is she a five timers club?

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,320
I forget how many times she's been on, but a lot.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,720
It's close, yeah.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,120
Yes, the audience, that makes this special, right?

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,600
The audience knows her very well and they know you very well.

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Yes.

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,320
And now, and the two, if they are, if the audience is a fan of your work separately

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,200
or together, then they'll, I'm sure they'll be a fan of the ultimate combined work.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Your latest.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
That is the name.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Age child.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Your latest collaboration.

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
That, and greatest, yeah.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,720
Our generation calls babies collabs.

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Yeah.

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,240
K-Tie X Carlson.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Yes.

55
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,000
Is, yeah.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,280
A surprise drop, an out of nowhere, not for you guys, but for, you know, you dropped it

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,920
in surprise Beyonce style.

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
It was a surprise.

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,680
I, Lindsay, for a while was saying she, cause she has a podcast called Teen Creeps where

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,920
they talk about her and her co-host talk about YA horror.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,880
She said, Oh, I'm going to probably talk about being pregnant.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
And then she just ended up not doing it.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,520
So then it ended up just like sort of, we ended up doing it Gairdner style.

64
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,280
Yeah, that was full surprise.

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Yeah.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Full surprise, which I like that.

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,080
It's always fun to find a surprise, but then she posted it on social media like a week

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
or two ago.

69
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,680
So this isn't going to be a full surprise, but people are obviously going to come here

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,400
to get some of the full details and hear, hear a little bit about the process, you know,

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
a little bit behind the scenes.

72
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,920
And a review of the experience, you know?

73
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
That's right.

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
That's what you do is you review experiences and you, you really had one and you're, and

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
you're in the middle of it.

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,400
You're, you've launched a perpetual one delivery.

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,320
How does delivery compare to like a day at California adventure?

78
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,120
Well it took, okay, here's the thing.

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,600
Delivering a baby is a lot like guardians of the galaxy mission breakout because there's

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
so many different ways it can go.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,480
There's so many different options for delivery.

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,880
Some I've heard sometimes it goes pretty smoothly.

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,360
There's a song, you know, it's just, you're playing a pot.

84
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,160
It's like a pop song and then it's over, but sometimes it's like monsters after dark and

85
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,000
it's a little scarier.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,920
Sometimes delivery is very scary.

87
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,760
It sounds like you had a monsters after dark.

88
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Yes.

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
It was a little bit more of a late night frightening.

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Yeah.

91
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,400
I think Lindsay and I, whenever Lindsay is back on here, I think we're going to tell

92
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,880
the story together eventually, which will be fun.

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
Just because we both have, we both agree on all the points.

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,800
It's just fun to hear the perspectives, but needless to say, we were there for a long

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,280
time.

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Everything is fine.

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,800
So I'm not trying to be like, Oh, what was us?

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,080
But I would describe part of the day as harrowing.

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,200
I would describe it as very, very stressful.

100
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,160
And you guys, you've both discussed your ability to deal with frightening fake situations.

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Yes, that's true.

102
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,880
Lindsay's, what is, what was Lindsay's thing with that?

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,480
She has to say, I love you on scary rides in case the ride collapses.

104
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah.

105
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,880
If there's a ride she's scared about, she'll like turn to me before and go, I love you.

106
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,360
And she'll say it really like seriously.

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,840
And I'll be like, stop.

108
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,320
You're going to will it to happen.

109
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Yeah, right.

110
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Exactly.

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,200
Well, you know what the good thing, the good thing about delivery was she was in too much

112
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,640
pain to even consider any of that.

113
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Oh, great.

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Oh, good.

115
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah.

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,680
So, so every baby fine, like the what's funny is, is having a baby for some reason, I don't

117
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,160
know if you went through this, but everyone discusses the baby as babe.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,680
They say baby when they're talking about the baby, they drop that the, so they'll say,

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,120
they'll say stuff like, Oh, you know, here, like they're showing you in the, and I swear

120
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
they'll say, this is baby seat.

121
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,920
They'll say, I swear one person said seat while we were looking at a medical professional

122
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,720
said one person, not a mostly was like, oh, there's the bottom or the butt or something

123
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,880
was not hospital wide, but not hospital seat was deployed.

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,200
But yeah, but maybe, but maybe they're a listener.

125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Maybe that was a way of.

126
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah.

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,400
It was a little sly way of saying, I'm a, I'm a Clifford.

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,360
I didn't say, but it's possible.

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,920
It's an honor to deliver a good boy baby.

130
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,520
Yes.

131
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,440
Well, that would be the ultimate Patriot on tier truly to get, to get in the, to

132
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
deliver my child.

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,640
Uh, so, but anyway, baby is universal.

134
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't know if you discover this.

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,240
Do you remember this?

136
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
Like it would not be like, okay, baby is doing well.

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,480
Oh, there's baby's heartbeat.

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
Baby is doing this.

139
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Weren't you using this terminology already?

140
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,160
Wasn't this your phrase, your phrase to us who were in on the pregnancy, were not

141
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,200
surprised by all that.

142
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,200
I, we started using it because we noticed the doctors all did it.

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,880
We noticed the nurses and the doctors would say baby instead of the baby.

144
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Yeah.

145
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,680
So during delivery, every was the same deal.

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,640
It was always baby.

147
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,880
And then luckily like as much as it was kind of a tough delivery, it was always

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
like, oh, baby's doing well, babe.

149
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,160
Don't worry.

150
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,080
Baby's fine.

151
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,680
Baby is well, baby is, you know what they kept saying, and this is multiple

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,480
nurses, oh, baby is happy.

153
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,800
They kept saying baby is happy, which I guess just means that the heartbeat is

154
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,440
happening because I honestly like there was no camera in there to see a big smile,

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
a joker smile from the child.

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,200
So that phrase also said by Jason when he's in a particular Disney

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
world rocking chairs.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah, baby, baby is happy.

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
Baby is happy.

160
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah.

161
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,000
So, uh, where are you going?

162
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,600
You were saying something?

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh, well, I was, I was going to say, um, it, uh, it kind of all happened as

164
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,560
you said, it all happened very quickly.

165
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Um, and I, you know, we were really, um, kind of recording a lot this

166
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
summer to get ahead of it.

167
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,680
You know, we were doing like sometimes three episodes a week, just to stock

168
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,840
stuff up and, um, feel bad for us audience.

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Pity us.

170
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,480
Whoa.

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:09,400
Just trying to provide some context, but the day it, uh, happened, uh, was also

172
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,120
around that time when I tested negative for COVID, we had some, like a few things

173
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,640
that some are where we had to like shift recordings around or cancel recordings

174
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,600
and stuff, including me getting the novel Corona virus.

175
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,880
And, um, in the, uh, uh, uh, Scott and I were emailing about getting, you know,

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,400
just some workflow stuff, uh, or texting about, you know, getting some stuff done

177
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
for the mission space episode.

178
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,680
And he said he was, um, doing, uh, he, he was cutting it together at the time.

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Uh, as you had sent a frantic, very detailed email that just said, uh,

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,320
here's how all this works.

181
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Uh, Lindsay's water just broke.

182
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,440
Uh, so that was missed it at the beginning.

183
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,480
It was lots of, it was a big, long explanation of how to make an episode.

184
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,680
And then, but at the, I was missed the top, but I, it, the middle of the night

185
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
timestamp was like, oh, that's gotta be it.

186
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,280
That's gotta be what.

187
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,680
Yeah.

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
We had, we had, we have all the, like these episodes ready.

189
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,200
And I, everything was, everything had been basically set up to like almost

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
be perfectly ready to go, except from the mission space episode, which I

191
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
remember thinking the night before.

192
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Cause this, okay, this is another thing.

193
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,080
And this is every, all the doctors say, we've talked about this.

194
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,040
It doesn't happen with the water breaking.

195
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
It's not a Dick Van Dyke episode.

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,280
We're like, oh my God, the water broke.

197
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,520
We got to get to the hospital.

198
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Everyone I know has had the water break.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,640
Almost maybe I'm the prop, maybe like whatever I was told in this class, like

200
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,520
the water breaking doesn't happen.

201
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
It's now it's happened to everybody.

202
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,920
You know, and me, you were told a similar thing where like, here's what happens.

203
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,000
You started starting to get contractions.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You start to feel them.

205
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
They get a little more.

206
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
You it's going to be hours before you actually go to the hospital.

207
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
And then at a certain point, the water breaks during that process.

208
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,640
No false.

209
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,240
So, so whenever it was Tuesday night, when I was going to bed, I was like,

210
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,600
should I do mission space tonight or should I do it in the morning?

211
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,320
Lindsay doesn't have any sign of contractions, no sign whatsoever.

212
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,240
The due date isn't a couple of days, but like, I'm sure tomorrow morning, if what

213
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,960
they said is true, you know, we have hours or whatever, I'll just do it in the morning.

214
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,680
So we went to bed, sleep for three hours, 2am.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,080
Uh, my water broke.

216
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,040
Oh, oh, I'm so tired.

217
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh no.

218
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
And if I immediately, I'm like, mission space.

219
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,760
Oh no.

220
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,480
You had to think about missions, but you had to think about the, your least

221
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,160
favorite ride in the middle of what it was.

222
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,760
It's a curse.

223
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah, I guess so.

224
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,320
Yeah.

225
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
So I threw, so I'm like, Oh no.

226
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,760
So like we're getting, I have like my go bag and then I was like, Oh, I

227
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,440
need to bring my computer.

228
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
Oh shit.

229
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,920
Oh no.

230
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,000
So I like grab my computer.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
I put it in the bag and my, all right, whatever, whatever.

232
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,520
So, you know, it's all like kind of panic calling people.

233
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,240
Oh, somebody's got to take care of the dog.

234
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,600
You know, you got to get it all together.

235
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,760
So yeah, we headed down, um, to the hospital and, uh, in so, so yeah, so

236
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,880
like they're checking her out and like at a certain point in the lull in the

237
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,000
checking out, I go, I gotta, I gotta get on the computer real quick.

238
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Oh no.

239
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,720
It wasn't like a panic.

240
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,680
It was a lull in activities.

241
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,960
It wasn't like the baby's a lot of down.

242
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah.

243
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,360
That wasn't like for you, not for Lindsay, but for you.

244
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,720
Yeah.

245
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah.

246
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,920
The baby's like a crowning and I'm doing a intro narration.

247
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,040
What's like a funny, uh, how do we reference like Buzz Aldrin in the.

248
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,160
Yeah.

249
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,080
Let's, let's, let's mention him.

250
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,600
Uh, yeah.

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,520
In one 15 minutes span, I found out, um, Lindsay's water broke infinity train

252
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,320
was getting yanked from HBO max and sunny eclipse voice actor, uh, Cal

253
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
David had died and died and I think I Dexter Scott.

254
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,920
Well, no one don't tell them these other things I just learned.

255
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,880
I did.

256
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,640
I ended up telling her Lindsay like a day or two I told broke the news to her.

257
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,160
I thought she had seen it, but she hadn't.

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
And then I was like, Oh yeah, I was thinking, I was like, Oh,

259
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm glad she was busy.

260
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,600
Yeah.

261
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,920
Uh, and unfortunately this, I mean, this has been joyous up to this point, but

262
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,800
your baby has been offered up as a sacrifice to discovery CEO, David Zaslav

263
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,520
Zaslav Zaslav.

264
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah.

265
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,440
So because Lindsay was, was on the Warner payroll at one point in time, she

266
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
does owe her first born.

267
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,240
Um, so, uh, I hope it was, so it was fun hearing about the baby, but, uh,

268
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,920
that's it.

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,720
Zaslav's now.

270
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
Well, Zaslav wins.

271
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,080
He always does.

272
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,960
Uh, uh, so yeah, so, so we, she cursed Zaslav in the hospital bed.

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Yeah.

274
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,360
Sarah's law that's during the pushing.

275
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,800
Yeah.

276
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,040
Yeah.

277
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,240
Yeah.

278
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,360
Just put all of your rate, all of the anger and how you feel, put it into one

279
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,080
name that gave her the juice.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,320
Yeah.

281
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,720
Release the baby.

282
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Unlike all of those projects that won't be released.

283
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Um, I, I do have to say the funniest show tie in with this is how you told the

284
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,040
two of us, so you guys were having a baby.

285
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh yeah.

286
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,560
Do you remember?

287
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,680
Yeah.

288
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:19,960
Yeah.

289
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah, of course.

290
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,800
Yeah.

291
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So yeah, tell it.

293
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,640
I will tell it from my perspective.

294
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,800
Uh, so we were, uh, in Hollywood, uh, 10 AM on a, I think Friday morning because

295
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,120
we were going to eat at, uh, the breakfast club, the, the influencer

296
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,800
cafe owned by planet Hollywood founder, Robert Earl's son, Robbie.

297
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,640
We've finished Celeb Rewary and we're like, well, we are close to one of the

298
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,400
restaurants we talked about the breakfast club.

299
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,120
Let's go enjoy an influencer cafe.

300
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,800
Little Robbie.

301
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,440
Um, and yeah, the, the, the outdoor seating was basically like a pen.

302
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,800
There was like three tables and whatever.

303
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,240
Yelps were like a celebrity fashion, like, Oh, and a bit spacious patio.

304
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,800
Come enjoy our, Oh, our sprawling patio.

305
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,200
And then I think they just weren't running it.

306
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,040
So yes, it was a,

307
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,520
Right.

308
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,360
Age.

309
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,600
Yeah.

310
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,880
It was all as it was only indoors otherwise.

311
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,720
So I was like, yeah, do we do it or not?

312
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,880
We're trying and I had not gotten the novel coronavirus yet.

313
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,400
So I was like, you know, we're trying not to get it by eating inside and I don't

314
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,280
really want to get it at Robbie Earl's.

315
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
Robbie Earl's club.

316
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,360
A restaurant that we, that came up on the show because it was bad and expensive.

317
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,240
Yeah.

318
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
Or so we had heard.

319
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
We don't know.

320
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,040
We didn't get to experience the breakfast club because we were discussing, do we

321
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
go indoors or out and then we were doing the math of like, Oh, should we eat

322
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,440
inside?

323
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,080
Should we not?

324
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,880
And Mike's like, ah, come here, come here.

325
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I need to talk to you guys.

326
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,920
And I was like, Oh, I know exactly what this is.

327
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
I don't think he said it that creepy.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,360
I don't think he said it like a, like a trench coat, like a Hollywood

329
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,480
Boulevard weed dealer.

330
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,280
He definitely waved us over like, uh, let's talk for a second.

331
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,800
You know,

332
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,760
Uh, it was like a, yeah, yeah.

333
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,240
So, and you, Jason, you said you knew exactly where I was headed with this.

334
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
I had a feeling.

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
Did you have a feeling, Scott, that we were having a baby?

336
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,640
Um, I don't think, I don't think I had gotten the proof of that yet.

337
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:30,960
No.

338
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,440
So yeah, I think it was a surprise to me.

339
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,200
Okay.

340
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,240
I, I had a feeling and you told us and you guys, at least you had talked about it

341
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,480
enough in the, the preceding years that I, I, I did not have to do the usual math

342
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,040
of, uh, when someone in their thirties or late twenties, uh, says we're pregnant

343
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,400
and you have to go like, congratulations and, or, uh, I'm so sorry.

344
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
What are you going to do?

345
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,920
You know?

346
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240
So, uh, Jason, this is the darkest thing.

347
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
You never say I'm sorry.

348
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,120
What are you talking about?

349
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,280
Well, no, no, you don't.

350
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,080
Sorry.

351
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,120
The mental math of like, uh, what doesn't help the mental met what scenario you've

352
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,880
had to tell people you're sorry.

353
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,000
No, I haven't.

354
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,480
No, I haven't said I'm sorry, but like, if people are not expecting it

355
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,440
and we're prepared for it, you know, I wouldn't tell you if that was the case.

356
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,920
They wouldn't be in a position to say I'm sorry, Jason, keep names out of it.

357
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,360
When was the last time someone told you they were pregnant?

358
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,080
And then in the, in your mind, you went, Oh shit for them.

359
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,320
I'm trying to think about that.

360
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,840
I, I don't recall anything.

361
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,480
Any recently because we're all getting older now, but I feel like I've heard,

362
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,160
I've heard stories after the fact.

363
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,760
You were all, if you were in your late twenties, you might have to do some math

364
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,440
and say, I'm so sorry.

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,640
Well, you know, I'm just saying, you know, sometimes people don't expect it.

366
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,120
And don't, you know, it's not on their to-do list.

367
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,280
It's not always on people's to-do list.

368
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,040
That is true.

369
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,600
And obviously not everybody would be a great parent.

370
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,320
I just think it's funny that you were like, Oh good.

371
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,440
This is, this is one of those situations where someone told me they were pregnant.

372
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
And I didn't have to say, Oh my God, so sorry for you.

373
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,680
I think we're like thinking like, you know, you didn't have to do that with us.

374
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,880
You didn't have to, when we told you at Epcot, you were like, um, is this a sorry?

375
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,400
Well, you guys were pretty joyous.

376
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,400
You weren't like, Hey, we got to get out of the line for the Moroccan restaurant.

377
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,720
You know, uh, we have to tell you something.

378
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,320
My more dire because I said, guys, we can't have breakfast at Robbie Earl's.

379
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,800
Come here.

380
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,480
Come here.

381
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,040
Come here.

382
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,880
Come here.

383
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,560
Callista.

384
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,120
Come here.

385
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,800
And if you get, if you say congratulations instead of sorry, this podcast is

386
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,720
fucking over.

387
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,120
Oh man.

388
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,440
Yeah.

389
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,360
So, so I, I, yes, I was, I was going to say something anyway, but I was obviously

390
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,280
going to say something soon anyway, but that was the, that was the grand reveal,

391
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,280
which was very, it felt perfect.

392
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,920
Honestly.

393
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,680
Felt the place.

394
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,120
Yeah.

395
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,520
A dumb, but a really stupid place.

396
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,120
Yes.

397
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,760
The outside of a restaurant we were going to because it was bad.

398
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,560
Um, I assume, I assume we have to assume.

399
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,080
So, no, we'll go ahead.

400
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,160
I was just going to say like that.

401
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,520
So, so yeah, review.

402
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm a theme.

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm an entertainment.

404
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,840
I'm a theme park journalist.

405
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,320
I talk about my, I do.

406
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm an opinion guy too.

407
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,360
I'm a columnist type person.

408
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,800
I don't write columns, but I write verbal columns about what things that I like.

409
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,280
Um, so I would like to, I write them with my talking and my tongue.

410
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,480
And that's how it works.

411
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,840
Um, so I do want to say there is a character that appeared and I guess it's not weird

412
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,720
to say we, we gave birth at the Kaiser on Sunset Boulevard.

413
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,440
Then no one's going to, we're not going to be there.

414
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,280
So we got to walk it.

415
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,200
Let's do the PCR hospital tour.

416
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,880
Let's see where Walt died and where Mike and Lindsay has a baby.

417
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,280
Now it's not going to be, I didn't get great video of it because, uh, uh, Lindsay

418
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,280
was inside and I was trying to figure out where to park the car and they told me the

419
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,960
parking garage was open and it was not.

420
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
And initially they told us there was a valet that was going to take the car, but

421
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,160
apparently the valet is not there at 3 a.m.

422
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,800
Apparently all that goes out the window and they don't say exactly what to do.

423
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,480
And then the person at the desk, you go, Hey, uh, where am I parking the car?

424
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
And they go, uh, just park it out.

425
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,920
One of those spaces in front.

426
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,280
And I go, there's no spaces there.

427
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,200
And they go, uh, but like on the side of the curb, I go, well, there's no spaces

428
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,680
on the side of the curb and they go, uh, well, uh, I go, can I park it in the zone?

429
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,120
That looks like it's a hospital loading zone.

430
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,200
And they're like, um, yeah, just, could you come back at 6 a.m.

431
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,800
and move it?

432
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,200
And I'm like, what, what is going on here?

433
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:00,880
All right.

434
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,760
The Wendy's is usually cool down the street.

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,920
Usually.

436
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,400
Yeah.

437
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,760
Usually.

438
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,520
Well, that's what I was thinking.

439
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,000
I go, am I going to park in front of the fucking Wendy's?

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,520
Like what?

441
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm going to go down Vermont and park in front of the Wendy's or the top of the

442
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
former UCB.

443
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,160
Yeah.

444
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,680
And you can see the sunset park in my old apartment building.

445
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,400
That's two blocks from the hospital.

446
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:29,240
Um, so, so, but I still, as a theme park journalist was able to get a video.

447
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,680
Of the thing that I'm talking about.

448
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,400
And let me just, I should have cued this up a little bit better, but here we go.

449
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,000
There is a character and I don't know what the name of this is.

450
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,560
And I got to look into it more, but there is a robot that patrols this hospital.

451
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,960
And whoa.

452
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,640
Whoa.

453
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,200
What a way.

454
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
Oh my God.

455
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,320
And can you see here?

456
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,320
It is like a, it's a weird egg.

457
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,920
It is so scary.

458
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,480
Whoa.

459
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,200
You can hear how my voice I'm tired and I'm sounding like Harrison Ford.

460
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,240
I'll replay that again for everyone.

461
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,960
Weird robot.

462
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,880
That's the security.

463
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
And it says security on it.

464
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
And I don't know what it does.

465
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,680
I don't think it has a gun on it, hopefully.

466
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,840
Um, but there's a character, like it's a, it's a original character, I think.

467
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,680
And I got a better video of it here.

468
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
Um, and I should have, you know, let Lindsay sit in their hospital longer.

469
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,760
So I could get better video.

470
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,920
You see it in the distance here.

471
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
Whoa.

472
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,320
And you hear that noise.

473
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
It's a, it's a light up egg.

474
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
It's an egg with like, yeah.

475
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,440
Okay.

476
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,600
Can you hear that noise though?

477
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:49,760
Yeah.

478
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,160
Yeah.

479
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:52,920
Whoa.

480
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,520
It's like space mountain ambience.

481
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,240
Yes.

482
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,760
I mean, this thing is creepy as shit, but also awesome.

483
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,040
Whoa.

484
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
It's a security robot.

485
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,480
I don't know if it like, what's it going to do?

486
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,000
What does this, when this thing's deployed, what does that look like?

487
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,440
I don't know.

488
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,560
We'll post the post these videos, but I don't, does it have missiles or something

489
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,800
in it?

490
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,560
Like it looks, it should, does it have a, like a cattle prod or a taser in it?

491
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,400
I don't know.

492
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,120
It's sort of, it's shaped kind of bullet like, and it's size.

493
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,400
It's hard to imagine what it could do other than like, if it tipped on its side

494
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,680
and then kind of rammed you in the stomach and knocked you over.

495
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,680
But if it, maybe if it, imagine it had the ability to shrink itself and then

496
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,840
like, uh, shoot up your butt.

497
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
It's a big, like, it's like, it's a giant probe.

498
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,200
It's a big suppository.

499
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,720
It's like a giant suppository.

500
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,640
Yeah, that's true.

501
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,120
You weren't at all concerned that this thing had been sent back in time to kill

502
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,520
your child before it could leave.

503
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,360
Oh.

504
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
A human resistance.

505
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,840
I was not that concerned.

506
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,160
I would assume that the robot would be a little more advanced if it came from the

507
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,720
future, because this thing was pretty slow.

508
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,400
Although I guess I didn't see it in like A mode.

509
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
This could have been B mode.

510
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,960
This could have been.

511
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,720
It's an Elon Musk future.

512
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,320
It's an Elon Musk Terminator.

513
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,280
So it's not, he promised like fully articulated real human and then they just

514
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
ended up with a, with a butt plug.

515
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,480
Yeah.

516
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
It looks like Andy Kaufman and heart beeps or something.

517
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,080
It went back to kill the John Connor of this time, but all it did was kind of like,

518
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,040
uh, give it a black eye and then it like broke, started making smoke, spun around

519
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,120
and, uh, fully exploded.

520
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,400
Elon Musk Terminator.

521
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,800
Very good idea for a sketch, Scott.

522
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,360
You should do that.

523
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,880
Yeah.

524
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,240
Yeah.

525
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,960
Very good.

526
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,720
Um, yeah.

527
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,440
So, so I was thrilled to see this.

528
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,880
This thing only apparently comes out at night too.

529
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
So great.

530
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,960
Cool.

531
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,680
I got, we got to look into more of that security robot and see if like that's a

532
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,000
common deterrent of some kind.

533
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,360
I don't know.

534
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
It works third shift security.

535
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,520
And then in the day it delivers breakfast and lunch for Uber eats.

536
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,160
Yeah.

537
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,720
The robot has a couple of different jobs.

538
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,200
At that speed, you have to, as long as you order seven hours in advance.

539
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,720
Yeah.

540
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:16,680
It's

541
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,760
Wow.

542
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,680
So there's, wait, there's robot, you there's this is incredible.

543
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,440
There's a parking lot convolutedness.

544
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,280
So PTR staple.

545
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,120
Yes, exactly.

546
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
There's a robot running.

547
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,440
There's like an Epcot style communicor type robot rolling around.

548
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,560
You, you managed that there's theme parkiness in your delivery story.

549
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,200
Yes.

550
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,640
There for sure is, is, and there's a little more, I mean, there's

551
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,720
there's a little more like when you leave the, leave the area where you gave birth,

552
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,680
they hit a button and like rockabye baby plays.

553
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,680
There's like a little like lullaby song that plays there as well.

554
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,880
Is that like what announces that a baby has been born?

555
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,600
We had that.

556
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:03,880
Yeah.

557
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,280
Here's a little like, let's let the hospital know you're letting God, it's

558
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,080
like a signal to God, let him know that that another one has entered the world.

559
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,280
Well, I'm sorry.

560
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,360
It wasn't when you wish upon a star.

561
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,640
I got, we should have requested it because like they have that birth plan and you can

562
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
do, I think we should have been a little more bold in what the birth plan was.

563
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,040
Cause I think you could make some very special requests in there, but we were

564
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,400
not, we did not act, we were not fussy.

565
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,000
Um, when the exact second of birth, can we hit the beginning of jaded?

566
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,080
The rockabye jaded.

567
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,040
We're not insane.

568
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
The rockabye.

569
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Yes.

570
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,160
Um, um, so yeah, so, so we were there like 2 AM to, we got there like 3 AM and we,

571
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,120
the baby was delivered at about 10 PM, which people have been in labor and longer.

572
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,840
I understand that, but it's still a long time.

573
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,480
That's a big one.

574
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,280
That's a big one.

575
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,520
It was a long time and a long time.

576
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
That's longer than a rope drop.

577
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,360
Just contextualizing it.

578
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,720
Thank you.

579
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:04,960
Yeah.

580
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,200
Yeah.

581
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,440
They know now they know what that is lengthwise.

582
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Um, so, so yeah, we'll, we'll tell again, we'll tell the full story.

583
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,840
It involves, um, multiple, uh, pain relief attempts, not working.

584
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Uh, it involves like a special equipment needing to be like, uh, repurposed to,

585
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,240
in, to, uh, allow Lindsay to give herself pain medicine that first didn't work.

586
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,240
Uh, it involves, you know, a nurse coming into monitor her oxygen at this point.

587
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,520
Um, it's a wild story.

588
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,360
I get up and I give like a kind of a 12 angry men's speech or like a video,

589
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,920
like a kind of a cinematic speech, I guess is really all I mean by that.

590
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,760
Something like where I'm like, look, we got to do this and that, or this

591
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,840
isn't gonna blame, you know, like get the doctor in here right now because we got

592
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,560
a, so I'm just imagining that this child is the all spark and we have to do

593
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,040
everything we can to protect it.

594
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,120
Now, are you with me or are you, are you with the evil decepticons?

595
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,600
I am evac, I guess in this situation.

596
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,720
And that was my, imagine that I'm Eva.

597
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
And then the, and then the doctors are like, oh, we get it now.

598
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,760
Okay.

599
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,160
Yeah.

600
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,760
The diner.

601
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,960
Enough.

602
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,680
You put it in terms.

603
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,880
We understand enough running.

604
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,800
I said, whatever, enough running.

605
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,200
Yeah.

606
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,000
Enough running.

607
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,440
Uh, so, so yeah, when Lizzy's on, we'll, we'll tell that full story.

608
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,360
Um, and then, yeah.

609
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,000
And then you, then you get like, you know, they do that.

610
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You get a souvenir.

611
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,600
You get the baby's footprints, you know, on a little card, um, which is a fun

612
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,680
take home, uh, they lost ours.

613
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,400
Uh, they lost our baby's footprints, which is nice.

614
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,600
And then Mike, Mike, I've got great news.

615
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,760
I think you can make that at home.

616
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm not getting the baby's feet dirty cause I got to clean it up then.

617
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,840
Yeah, that's true.

618
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,240
That's the asshole.

619
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Uh, but, but, uh, so a couple, uh, like a couple of days ago, we got in the mail.

620
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,800
Baby's footprints and you look, you look over on the back and it's,

621
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,320
it was the wrong baby.

622
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,560
They sent us the wrong baby footprints, uh, or at least his name, the baby, I

623
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,680
don't know, named the baby wrong.

624
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:29,280
Uh, uh, so was it a, but you had a name, like, was it the wrong gender?

625
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:29,880
Yeah.

626
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,480
Well, uh, little Eric, we love you.

627
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
Uh, it was, yeah.

628
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,640
So, so yeah, we got that.

629
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
And then, yeah, so we were in the delivery room and the

630
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,360
delivery room is pretty spacious.

631
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,560
You know, a lot of people come in there, obviously a lot of nurses and doctors.

632
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,600
And there's kind of a couch that pulls out.

633
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,240
And I, for some foolish reason, thought we were, that's where we were, we're

634
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,880
going, we were doing it in here, like as far as like sleeping and that was going

635
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,200
to be it, they move you obviously, which of course they do.

636
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,760
Oh, right.

637
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,000
Right.

638
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,200
Yeah.

639
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,080
So, but, but I was like, okay, so, you know, well, I'll say this first.

640
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,880
Um, and this is, uh, the exp here, what I'll say, I'm not, I'm not, I don't

641
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,960
think I'm going to turn into one of those guys who's like, you gotta have kids.

642
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,680
You know what you gotta do it or whatever.

643
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,640
Cause I don't believe everybody should necessarily have kids.

644
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,720
Um, but the experience, if we're talking about experiential things, uh, having

645
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,080
your child dumped on your partner or your wife, that that's the craziest

646
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,280
moment of my life.

647
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
That's the most insane thing.

648
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,720
I almost like was thinking like later, like everyone should get to do this though.

649
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,520
Like if there was a way everybody could at least do this and then not after, like

650
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
this experience is maybe the craziest.

651
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,720
You're so exhausted by everything too.

652
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,320
So it's almost like you started a, such a low level of serotonin and then all

653
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,320
of a sudden you're not prepared for it.

654
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,160
I don't think unless you had kids before, but it's the craziest experience.

655
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,200
And I mean that in like a good way of like all of a sudden, like a per like a

656
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,920
person you couldn't conceive of is just dumped because we did the thing where

657
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,040
they like throw the baby on Lindsey.

658
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,160
Did you guys do that?

659
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,840
Was it a throw?

660
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,200
It seemed like they threw her across the room.

661
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Was it a reasonable distance?

662
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,760
I was a little cloudy up until that point.

663
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,680
So it wasn't, but it was.

664
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,200
Yeah.

665
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
You like, you know, you go skin to skin.

666
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
The baby is immediately placed on the mother.

667
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,360
That's like the first interaction they have.

668
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,040
Yeah.

669
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,200
Um, but it was, it was unbelievable.

670
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,120
It was, I mean, it was like, it was like, I'm trying to even describe it.

671
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,000
It's like we screamed.

672
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Like it was like, we both were like, ah, there's a, what the fuck is that?

673
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,600
That looks like me.

674
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm like, that's me.

675
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,480
It's real.

676
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,720
Like, it's just like crazy.

677
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,960
It's crazy.

678
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,560
And I'm underselling it, how emotional it is and how overwhelming it is.

679
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,400
But I was like, if we're talking experiences, this is the craziest,

680
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,680
best experience I've ever had.

681
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,440
Um, I wish, I wish there was a ride that could simulate that for people.

682
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,200
If they were not going to have kids or, or whatever.

683
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,400
The making of me got you a little bit.

684
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,040
Yeah.

685
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,400
Yeah.

686
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,360
It's a very emotional, very joyous experience.

687
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,320
Um, yeah.

688
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,280
So I, I think you're giving Nathan Fielder ideas for season two of his show.

689
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,520
Sure.

690
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,560
Uh, so yeah, we did that.

691
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,440
So we did that.

692
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,720
I don't think this, I don't think Liz, you'll be upset.

693
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Uh, we saved cord blood, which, you know, you can do.

694
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,920
And then they also, obviously the hospital does some of that already.

695
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,000
So another experience is, you know, we're sitting there, like just looking at the

696
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,680
baby and just overwhelmed because it's so wild.

697
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
And I immediately, I think the baby looks like me.

698
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,200
I think she looks like me, uh, when I was a baby and, and I'm obviously,

699
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,400
I see you a lot.

700
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,000
And yeah, it's like, she's got my nose when I was a little kid or like a little kid.

701
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,440
And you say it was a girl.

702
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,320
It's a girl.

703
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,840
Oh yeah.

704
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,160
I guess I think I said that, or maybe I didn't.

705
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,000
So we had, um, so we had, so, so the baby came, so after that, after that sort of

706
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,480
moment of, of just staring at the baby going, oh my God, it's real.

707
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,920
It actually happened.

708
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,880
Uh, I went to, I went to the bathroom and I came out and it would look like I walked

709
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,200
into a maze at a horror night.

710
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,320
The amount, because you really don't notice all that stuff that's happening

711
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,400
because you're staring into the eyes of your child.

712
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,040
And that's obviously insanely important and emotional.

713
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,680
And then you kind of shake it off and you go, ah, the hell the hell's going on.

714
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,240
You remove the love, the new love from this situation.

715
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,240
Oh my Jesus Christ.

716
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,800
Oh, you'll also like the pictures, the first pictures that you took that you

717
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,040
currently regard as like just a miracle, perfect joy, you like in a, in a couple

718
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,200
months, you'll look at them and go, ah, what's this weird flesh spider?

719
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,560
Like, what's, you know, what she actually looks like.

720
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,160
Yeah.

721
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
I mean, that's not true.

722
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,280
Like it's a mirror, but like the one that I have, that's him like screaming for his

723
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,560
life and so tiny and like, yeah, yeah.

724
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,560
What, like when time passes, it feels so crazy.

725
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,160
Yeah, yeah, sure.

726
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,080
She's, she's already, it's interesting to see after a few weeks even on the

727
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,200
difference, but yeah, so, so then we go to the other room after that.

728
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,520
Uh, and that's, and I go, oh, we're going to different room and I go, oh, you know

729
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,720
what, it's going to be better than this.

730
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,440
It's going to have like an actual bed or something for me to sleep in.

731
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,840
False worse, much room.

732
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,440
The room is basically just has a chair and the chair kind of reclines into like

733
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,600
three sections and all the sections have a metal square frame and you can feel it

734
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
while you're lying on it.

735
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:13,280
So I slept on three pieces of metal with a thin cushion for two nights in this

736
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,600
weird little room as the worst nights of your life or the most challenging nights

737
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,040
of your life where you like barely get some, maybe they'll like take her away

738
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,800
for a minute to like, yeah, but yeah, it's great.

739
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,280
And you're a, you're a tall man.

740
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,400
It's tough to fit on any couch kind of situation.

741
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,120
That's crazy.

742
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,280
So this happened in the American healthcare system.

743
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,400
Yes, believe it or not.

744
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,800
Yes, that is where it was.

745
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,840
It was in America.

746
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,400
Um, so, so yeah, I would give it a bad, as far as accommodations, as far as hotel

747
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,520
review, I was very bad, very bad.

748
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,440
Lindsay obviously had a hospital bed, the baby had a bassinet.

749
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
I think they were fine.

750
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,040
Uh, I, it felt like they were testing me or so.

751
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,320
I felt like I was being tested by God or by some prankster or something.

752
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,520
Like how could, luckily I was only sleeping like an hour and a half at a time.

753
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,800
So I guess it didn't even really matter because yeah, people basically, yeah, if

754
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,920
you've not done this, people, nurses, doctors are coming in to this room every

755
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,240
couple hours to check on everybody and to make sure everything's going okay.

756
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,800
So you would wake up and you just like, this is a dude in the room.

757
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,560
Like you fall asleep, you open your eyes, you're as a dude, like just checking out

758
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,000
your baby and you're like, oh, hey, he's like, yeah, everything is good.

759
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,360
And I go, whatever man, thumbs up.

760
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
And then you like fall back asleep.

761
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,400
Who are you?

762
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,720
I'll never see you again.

763
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,640
You're here at a crucial juncture in my life.

764
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
We will never speak.

765
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,520
Never speak again.

766
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,800
You could be, yeah, you could have just put this outfit on.

767
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,720
You went to the spirit Halloween and got a doctor outfit, wandered in here.

768
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,240
I don't know.

769
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,840
I'm too tired to care.

770
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,280
I don't want you to do anything to us or the baby, but what I'm so tired at this

771
00:35:50,280 --> 00:36:00,160
point, so, so yeah, then also for reviewing experiences, the, the food in a hospital.

772
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,600
I hate to be like an old standup comedian here.

773
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,960
Oh yeah.

774
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,680
But you cannot wait to get home.

775
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah.

776
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,200
What the fuck?

777
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,600
Why?

778
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,800
Why is it so bad?

779
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,720
Why can't it just be like a little better?

780
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,840
Why do they have to buy?

781
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,600
Why can't I, why do they have to buy Shasta Cola?

782
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,120
It's all Shasta.

783
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,320
All the sodas are Shasta and they're tiny ones.

784
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,320
I just don't know.

785
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,280
Better sodas hospitals.

786
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,240
And everything is like, oh, do you want like a juice?

787
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,920
And I go, why?

788
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,480
You know what?

789
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,360
I don't have juice a lot.

790
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,400
It would be nice to have a juice.

791
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,520
Well, here's a child's juice box for you to drink.

792
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
And you're like a juice box.

793
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,400
What?

794
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,080
It's like everything is done to like save as much money as possible.

795
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,520
And you're like, why a little bit better?

796
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
How about a little, I'm not fancy.

797
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm not a fancy guy, but.

798
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,360
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

799
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,240
It's a hospital, not above a gump.

800
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,640
You're not going to get a non-alcoholic slushie.

801
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,720
I wanted that though.

802
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,960
I just like a sore.

803
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
They had a sorbet.

804
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
Just like licking your lips, holding a newborn.

805
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,320
Like I got a whole palette of Coca Cola dream world at home.

806
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,480
I ordered, I ordered the Coke dream world.

807
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,440
It was, it was street dated August 15th.

808
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,640
Okay.

809
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,640
Which means that they're not supposed to sell before, but I think due to an error

810
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:32,080
on, I think the Walmart app, I was able to order three cases of it, three fridge

811
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,680
cases, small cases on the 12th.

812
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,080
And then I think it arrived the 14th.

813
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,600
So I was able to taste dream world a day earlier before street date.

814
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,000
And you sent me all of that information as it was happening.

815
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,800
Well, Jason sent me a picture of it as if like, Hey, check this out.

816
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
And I go, my man, I'm way ahead.

817
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,680
I'm already there.

818
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,880
There was, there was the discussion of on our thread with Griffin Newman.

819
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,080
He was pointing out the, because he, he discovered that you had had this baby

820
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,080
via just a casual joke that was made.

821
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
And then he's like, hang on a second.

822
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,080
When was, what was the date?

823
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,800
Because he went back and did some, some date work and realized that you had pretty

824
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,920
quickly into it, texted him photos of an avatar to action figure.

825
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,040
I think it was Friday.

826
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,920
I think it was Friday morning, I think.

827
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,240
Yeah.

828
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,960
So we, the baby was born Wednesday, a very late or late Wednesday.

829
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,240
And then Friday morning I was back to texting people.

830
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,760
Bullshit.

831
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,640
Yeah.

832
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah.

833
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,040
We were, we were texting about what had happened on a wrestling show.

834
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,120
Uh, pretty quickly.

835
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,800
Yeah.

836
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,480
Which there's a lot of downtime.

837
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,400
You're, you're bored.

838
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,080
As I said to him, I look, my son was born and then two days later, Quibi was born.

839
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,680
So I was texting up a storm.

840
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,480
Well, I probably never texted more like it's still alive.

841
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay.

842
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay.

843
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,280
Okay.

844
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
Back to making fun of this.

845
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,800
You know, what's funny is I believe Scott, I believe you texted me on that

846
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,280
Wednesday while we were delivering.

847
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,160
I think you texted me like 6 PM, like, Hey update, like question mark or like

848
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,640
maybe even a smiley face that might be crazy, but he's expecting he must be done

849
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,080
by now.

850
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,000
You certainly definitely texted me like you guys must be done.

851
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,680
And this was in maybe the peak worst moment of delivery.

852
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:25,000
And I think I looked at it and went, Oh, you, how dare you be so optimistic.

853
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,200
You with your no information, you and your, you and your comfy home.

854
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,400
I'll get to that later.

855
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,640
Too much explanation.

856
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,880
I am recalling the timeline wise.

857
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,400
I almost texted you at some point on Thursday at some sort of boring logistical,

858
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,000
like, Hey, can you do this?

859
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,120
Or do you want me to do this?

860
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,080
Can we get this done for the babies done?

861
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,200
You guys are probably like, you're sitting in one of your uncomfortable

862
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,000
horror, hospital horror rooms.

863
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,200
And I, I just got distracted and didn't.

864
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,080
And looking back, I'm like, Oh, I'm so glad I didn't text them about like, do

865
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,600
you want me to send this email?

866
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,480
Yeah.

867
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,200
I mean, you know, Thursday, everything had pretty much gone okay.

868
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,600
And fine.

869
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
Like everything was set down, but it is.

870
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,720
Yeah.

871
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,680
It would have been funny if you texted me that on Wednesday because I would have

872
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,600
maybe cursed you out.

873
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,600
It might've been Wednesday.

874
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,040
It might've been Wednesday before I knew that you were at the hospital.

875
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,920
So, okay.

876
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,840
Something like that.

877
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,680
I would have like, till Lindsay, I'd be like, Jason's a asshole.

878
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,240
I would have like yelled about you or something.

879
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,200
Cause I, well, I, cause I hadn't told you guys yet, like, Hey, got the

880
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,240
negative COVID test.

881
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Cause I was like, Oh shit, I gotta get on a plate at it, you know, 24

882
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,200
hours since this worked out.

883
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
So, um, yeah.

884
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,880
So, so it may have been funny.

885
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,040
I wouldn't have been mad forever, but it would have been funny.

886
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,440
Cause if we're, if we're doing like, uh, kind of date stamps and forensics

887
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,960
kind of stuff, I have one more thing to add to that conversation just because I

888
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,280
like any of the juxtaposition of what we, what we, and the listeners know about

889
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,320
you, Mike, and now, uh, compared with you having a child that I went on our

890
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,680
YouTube channel to upload the video about the camel Vegas groove blender, which

891
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,240
you can hear about on our Patreon.

892
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,640
Yes.

893
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,520
And sometimes, because we all have access to the YouTube and you could see people

894
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,080
search history and watch history.

895
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,480
So you can tell what people have been viewing.

896
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,520
And it was really funny seeing this is from, uh, earlier in the week, uh, just

897
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,480
a big run of videos that are 10 baby care skills, every new parent should learn

898
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,240
ultimate newborn baby hacks, uh, diaper change, wiping out a clean baby during

899
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,800
change.

900
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,440
And then right before all of that, uh, club random, Bert Kreischer on his

901
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,720
daughter being woke.

902
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,640
Well, that's an important thing to know.

903
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,680
If you have a daughter, is she going to be woke?

904
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,280
I mean, and this is where this is a crucial juncture because every decision

905
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,000
you make like the type of wiping the, the, the powdering, the, you know, what

906
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,880
you say to her, these are the, these are the days where you can maybe save her

907
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,360
from the scourge of being woke.

908
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,960
Right.

909
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,920
So check out what Bert is saying.

910
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,160
Make sure you don't end up down the Kreischer family path.

911
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,240
Wait, how are you seeing this stuff?

912
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,200
Cause now I want to say, is it just if you were logged in on the show,

913
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
YouTube account?

914
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,280
It depends what happens.

915
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
We'll give the listeners too.

916
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,680
So everybody can check it out.

917
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,640
If you're on that, yeah, Google, whatever it's your YouTube accidentally, not

918
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,320
accidentally links it to your YouTube.

919
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,840
So, okay.

920
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,000
So anyway, I, boy, do I hope I'm so happy to hear it's a girl, but if I hear it's a

921
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,400
woke girl, I don't know if I can be part of your family journey anymore.

922
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,200
Well, I'm going to show her all Rob Schneider's movies early.

923
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,680
Oh, that's great.

924
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,520
Daddy daughter is being released exclusively at Hawkins cinemas.

925
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,920
We've all enjoyed his daughter's music.

926
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,920
What was that song?

927
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,240
Oh, did we play?

928
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,280
Exes.

929
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,640
Exes and oh, say haunt me.

930
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:03,960
Yeah.

931
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,280
Yeah.

932
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,480
So, yeah, I mean, that's basically the tail.

933
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:17,600
And baby, baby, baby is doing great at home and everything's cool.

934
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,400
And we're very lucky, very happy.

935
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,600
And we're not Jason, we're not upset about having a baby.

936
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,200
We love that.

937
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,720
Yeah.

938
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,680
So no, so listeners should not say I'm sorry.

939
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,040
Don't say I'm sorry because we wanted this and we are we are actually other than

940
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,520
this sleeping, not sleeping so much.

941
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,840
We are we are very much enjoying.

942
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,440
We are obsessed with her.

943
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,160
It's great.

944
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,000
Everything's great.

945
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,160
Oh my.

946
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,920
Oh, geez.

947
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,240
That's that's really nice.

948
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,320
Yeah.

949
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:59,680
You know, my my heartfelt thing to say is that I had so we are our son in in 2020.

950
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,040
So the years he's been alive are 2020 to 2022.

951
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:11,640
And I like when I see those dates or I make photo albums that have that is that date

952
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,440
in brackets and put all of our like really wonderful memories into the eye.

953
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:23,320
When I see those years, I have there's like a glow that I feel when I'm just looking at

954
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,120
the year names, 2020 and 2021.

955
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,520
Now we all know how horrible those years have been.

956
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,840
These are like all time for the world.

957
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,760
Worst years like like years that put terror in most people's.

958
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:43,360
But I genuinely I like when I look at just 2020, 2021, I have this like, oh, geez,

959
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,200
because I think about him and I think about like, oh, and then he was in that stage and

960
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,920
then that stage and we did this and we did that.

961
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,800
And it I don't know.

962
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,560
Just like I feel wonderful.

963
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,280
Just even just thinking about this time.

964
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,840
And I just like I wish that for you guys so much.

965
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,800
Hey, I wish that the actual years are better and with all the other stuff.

966
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,960
But I hope that you're looking back at 2022, 2023 and you're just like a glow because of

967
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,280
all of the memories you're making.

968
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,640
And, you know, she's she's very set up for success.

969
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:27,120
You guys are both so wonderful and and creative people who are very engaged with things

970
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,680
you love. And I know that's going to be the case with your daughter, too, that like she's

971
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,800
set up for success. She's going to experience a lot of cool stuff thanks to the both of you.

972
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,320
So good for her.

973
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:46,280
She picked a good, good parents to be assigned to in a existential way.

974
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,440
Thank you, Scott. That's very nice.

975
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,920
I hope. Yeah, the only the only the only feeling I have now is just like, all right, get a

976
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,400
little older so you can like register some of the cool stuff that your parents are into,

977
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,960
you know, like just like like I don't want I don't want to move stuff along.

978
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,480
I want everything. I want to enjoy everything as it happens.

979
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,440
But I go, if you could only enjoy the thin Lizzie song we're listening to right now,

980
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,280
you know, if you could appreciate these guitar guitar harmonies that are happening right

981
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,320
now, you know, that would be that would be great.

982
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,000
So maybe six months she'll start air guitar ring while we're listening.

983
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,440
Yeah, I know you don't want to fast. I was saying, you know, cherish these years and

984
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,680
hope these are wonderful years. But the year you need to have your eye on is 2035, because

985
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:38,360
that's when she is a teen and that's when you achieve your dream of being a cool teen

986
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:45,680
dad. Just 13 years to suffer through and then you get to be the the the teen dad you've

987
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,440
always wanted to be for some reason. For some reason.

988
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,920
Yeah. Yeah, no, that is a good goal.

989
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,720
That's a goal post, essentially.

990
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,400
I'll say this. Lindsay was like we had a long had a discussion of like, when is the first

991
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,080
time you take the kid to Disney or something?

992
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,320
And she was she initially started at some insane thing like five.

993
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,080
And I went, are you out of your mind?

994
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,040
Five. What are we doing here?

995
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,120
Yeah, are you kidding?

996
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,280
You've gotten mad at.

997
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,720
Yeah, I got I threw I threw something through the window.

998
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,880
I got mad. Yeah.

999
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,080
Lindsay, come on.

1000
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,320
They're free below a certain age.

1001
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,880
You got to get a few fit in as many as you can.

1002
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,920
You got to forget about your freebies in.

1003
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,760
We actually we went to we went this is a side note.

1004
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,240
We went to Disneyland last, I guess, it's April.

1005
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,320
Yeah, like last April already with some friends who were in from out of town.

1006
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,560
And so the baby was there at Disneyland.

1007
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,960
And this is I got like a little emotional.

1008
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,000
I was like, this is baby's first trip to Disneyland.

1009
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,800
Baby's been on the haunted mansion.

1010
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,000
But like, well, but that's that's nice.

1011
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,920
I wish I mean, technically, our son was at Disney World.

1012
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,360
Yes. You know, when you guys found out and I wish I had that emotion,

1013
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,680
but instead it was like, it is so motherfucking hot.

1014
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,000
Jesus Christ.

1015
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,520
Yeah, we have to get Aaron on a bench or something.

1016
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,080
Jesus. Yeah.

1017
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,000
So but anyway, so so now that the baby's here, Lindsay's like,

1018
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,000
I do want to take her very soon.

1019
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1020
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,480
You just have to you guys just have to get past these record unending heat

1021
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,080
waves we are subject to in Los Angeles.

1022
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,680
Yes, that's true.

1023
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,480
We will not do that in the heat, especially for a newborn.

1024
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,280
But when you start, that's the other I mean, I've said this already.

1025
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,200
But when you merge those,

1026
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,880
they when you merge the interests and the stuff that we talk about on the show,

1027
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,040
and the places that we love and you see it through their eyes.

1028
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,400
Oh, my God. If you like, I'm not kidding.

1029
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,920
I mean, maybe this is an on brand thing, but I agree with you completely

1030
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,040
on that moment that they show up is is is a highlight of the life.

1031
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,240
But then like starting to just like a place that I've never cared.

1032
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:00,120
Like I've never given a shit about the Minion Cafe at Universal Studios Hollywood.

1033
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,120
But my taking him and having him like

1034
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,920
hit all the umbrellas and in a repeating order for 15 minutes

1035
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,600
and the like the happiest I've ever seen him.

1036
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,640
Well, you know, some song I don't know from Despicable Me plays over and over.

1037
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,680
Like it's their neck and neck.

1038
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,640
There's born and then there's like playing with trash cans

1039
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,920
and stationary old timey car tires at Universal Studios.

1040
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,920
Just broad joy.

1041
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,360
It makes me smile.

1042
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,560
Huge is just thinking about it.

1043
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,080
I am very excited about it.

1044
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,800
And very excited to give her like some of the things I've bought for her already.

1045
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,480
Like the real goes plus.

1046
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,480
Yeah. Here's some flush.

1047
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,120
Wow. The talking toy, the evil ghost toilet

1048
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,880
that I had when I was a child.

1049
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,200
And now they they made a new.

1050
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,680
It's the same version, I guess they just kind of.

1051
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,440
Wow. Ironically, I've had a window open for like a few weeks on my desktop

1052
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,520
to buy that toy for myself.

1053
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,640
Come on, buy it for yourself, Jason.

1054
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,520
I'll get it. Yeah, I'll get it.

1055
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,760
I yourself. So toilet.

1056
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,960
Did you have a toilet with a tongue?

1057
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,960
Did you have the toilet when you were younger?

1058
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,600
No, I I remember the toilet.

1059
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,680
I don't think I ever had the toilet, but.

1060
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,320
Yeah. Plenty plenty of toys with those cards with that look. Yeah.

1061
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,000
So anyway, yes, this episode included.

1062
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,680
We made a baby and I never had the toilet.

1063
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,480
The talking ghost toilet.

1064
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,920
Yeah, things that were said.

1065
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,360
I mean, I found a bunch of pictures.

1066
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,240
My mom pulled out a box, a bunch of pictures when I was home.

1067
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,120
And I posted some on the show account of like a precocious me

1068
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,240
at the 20th anniversary year of Disney World.

1069
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,600
And there was definitely some toys.

1070
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,960
There was a lot of them, mostly just me holding action figures.

1071
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,000
And some of those I just sent to Mike. Yeah.

1072
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,520
There was a picture you were being snooty about the decor of the 1991.

1073
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,840
I it certainly looked like I was being snooty. Yeah.

1074
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,120
Look, look, the logo is so good.

1075
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,480
They could have gone a little harder on the banners.

1076
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,480
That's all I'm saying. Looking back.

1077
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,520
Yes. So anyway, we were we really were only supposed to do this

1078
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,560
for 20 minutes. Now we're almost an hour. Yeah.

1079
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,880
Yeah. Well, OK, so here.

1080
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,760
Well, then here's what's what we can say before we move on.

1081
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,360
From this point, we enter a bit of a convoluted timeline,

1082
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,520
especially on the second day.

1083
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,200
You'll hear episode. Just don't get confused.

1084
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,280
Stick with us, because sometimes Mike isn't a dad yet.

1085
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,720
And sometimes Jason is gone because of Covid.

1086
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,080
Yeah. You hear us say that Jason has Covid.

1087
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,320
It doesn't necessarily mean that he has it again.

1088
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,240
That might have been the past Covid.

1089
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,720
And you might even hear references to BugCon being in the future,

1090
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,760
even though it happened already and Bug has retired.

1091
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,640
And that was the last BugCon.

1092
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,000
So don't be confused with the bug mythology that you know so well.

1093
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,720
If I say it's in the future, we've been all over the map.

1094
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,920
So just try to stick with us.

1095
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,200
And, you know, think of it like better call Saul.

1096
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,120
It's it's inventive storytelling

1097
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,920
where you don't know where you're going and when.

1098
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,640
And I think, you know, get ready to laud us

1099
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,360
for this what will be a dynamic period in our history.

1100
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,440
It'll keep you on your toes as a listener.

1101
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,400
And I think that's what's fun.

1102
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,880
You're not going to get complacent in your listening.

1103
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,840
You'll have to really figure some shit out.

1104
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,240
Oh, I think on your toes, there's one.

1105
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,400
There's one Patreon episode where we acknowledge

1106
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,640
I'm about to be a father, but I was not a father yet.

1107
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,440
So you'll see, you'll see when it's coming.

1108
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,720
And yes, oh, by the way, yes, also the day I was late,

1109
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,360
there's a lot my parents moved out to Los Angeles to help with the baby.

1110
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,600
And they were like there was so many shenanigans going on that week.

1111
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,440
That is why I was late.

1112
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,680
It's all baby related in this.

1113
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,000
And that's why I said everything's fine and good.

1114
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,520
It was just a very chaotic week.

1115
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,880
So, yes, anybody who some listeners, some listeners are like, well, OK,

1116
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,320
now we know and thank you for explaining.

1117
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,840
I want other listeners who just want to hear us talk about rides

1118
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,640
or like they are so in the fucking weeds right now.

1119
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,320
Yeah. Well, I've been hearing about logistics for fucking 30 minutes.

1120
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,680
50 minutes in. Yeah. At this point.

1121
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
What do you think's going to happen at this point?

1122
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,400
I just want to say also now we are getting ever closer

1123
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,760
to our final form as Disney daddies.

1124
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1125
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,920
Ever. There's no no pressure on Jason.

1126
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,200
I'm just saying two of the three have become Disney daddies with a Z.

1127
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,560
Yeah. Shifting fully away from the initial tagline.

1128
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,000
And childless where we take now it's over half. Right.

1129
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,640
It's the least applicable tagline. Right. I could imagine.

1130
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,720
And as soon as I'm still in, I'm still in my flop era.

1131
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,280
I got out of bed an hour ago.

1132
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:09,720
But, you know, when Jason, if Jason has a child, if when he has a child,

1133
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,920
I don't know. But when that happens or if it happens,

1134
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,800
then the podcast will completely change from any curses, any tangents

1135
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,320
to just glowing positivity about everything.

1136
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,200
It will be like three Mr.

1137
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,720
Maros hosting this podcast.

1138
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,600
And it's going to be like, well, you know, that will complete the transformation.

1139
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,640
That will be sort of like everything up until that point will be

1140
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,680
or better called Saul, basically our origin story.

1141
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,720
And then because of the podcast, we became Disney daddies.

1142
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,680
And then from then on, it's just positivity and we get invited

1143
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,520
to every Disney press event.

1144
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,800
They fly us. They put us up and it'll be a whole new world.

1145
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,160
This limited time lemonade

1146
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,520
that's dyed purple makes me so happy.

1147
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,920
It's almost it makes me almost as happy as seeing my child for the first time.

1148
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,640
There's so many joys in this life, whether it be souvenir

1149
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,880
sippers or looking on the eyes that you yourself created.

1150
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,040
Can you believe there was ever a less enlightened time where we would,

1151
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,560
you know, make fun of a weird barren theme park in Arkansas

1152
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,800
or talk about a restaurant that we didn't like and didn't

1153
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,600
went to to make fun of Scott?

1154
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,880
Were we ever these men?

1155
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,120
Scott, I shudder when I think of some of the remarks we made.

1156
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,120
Or I I can't even listen back to some of the older podcasts

1157
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,040
with our snarky attitude and our glib remarks.

1158
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,400
The things we valued, the mistakes that we made.

1159
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,280
I will never listen to them again, and neither should the listener.

1160
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,800
And I can't wait to eat this purple and green cake.

1161
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Well, I guess my bullshit doesn't really change very much in this scenario.

1162
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,160
Well, it will. It will.

1163
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,040
That's what I'm saying. You will become like us.

1164
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,000
You will find Christ and you will.

1165
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1166
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
That's another thing that happened. This is a turn.

1167
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,960
Yeah. Oh, yeah. We've been texting about it.

1168
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,160
Yeah. We're I'm born again. Did I say that?

1169
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,880
No, no. You were just texting about John Moxley.

1170
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,120
Oh, yeah. I like wrestling still, but I'm born again.

1171
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,000
So, no. OK. That's also part of it.

1172
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,840
So anyway, I'm a Disney daddy now.

1173
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,360
And wow. Well, and and I officially now I'm not going to hand it over

1174
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,720
because I don't have the right to do this.

1175
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,320
There's an outside body that does this.

1176
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,840
But if you take over as the recipient of the National Daddy Award,

1177
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,520
I will not fight it. Thank you.

1178
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,440
But if I get it again, you know, that's fine.

1179
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,640
Fuck you and fucks and all Disney.

1180
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,760
Disney daddy's, you know, one of the things they do is share.

1181
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,040
So, you know, wow, that's gosh.

1182
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,760
And, you know, I don't think we should ever make fun of Walter Gunn.

1183
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,080
I think we're all that's what I because he envisioned a world

1184
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,240
of just holding hands in a world in a magical land of make believe

1185
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,480
with a living mouse.

1186
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,960
And now we have we have our little mice that we walk down

1187
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,960
our beautiful childhood street.

1188
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,280
He was he was perfect. Our children are perfect.

1189
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,200
Everything's perfect. When my child, when my child, we should not.

1190
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,640
We should not speculate one.

1191
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,400
What charisma less actor will be playing him in that Lenny Reif and Stahl biopic?

1192
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,480
I I dressed my child up like the little newsie

1193
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,200
in the California Adventure Street show,

1194
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,800
and I started playing suitcase in a dream and I created the narrative

1195
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,480
of my child on the on the train out to meet me with a dream.

1196
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,160
And it's beautiful.

1197
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,320
Yeah. Well, you have to do that because you still you still think the idea

1198
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,080
that she came from sex is a little icky body.

1199
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,440
It is a little body.

1200
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,160
We need a G rated backstory.

1201
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,640
That's when I got born again is after I like I had to reconcile

1202
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:59,200
what we had done to do to and reclaim your virginity.

1203
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,080
Yeah, I am now a new version.

1204
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,880
And now that we're now that baby business is out of the way,

1205
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,200
Mike's a virgin and things are as they should be.

1206
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,520
I am a fresh virgin.

1207
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,600
So it so it back up.

1208
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,720
Oh, my goodness.

1209
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,360
All right. Well, hey, you survived podcast, the ride this zone of it.

1210
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,640
And hey, Mike, this one's for you and Lindsey, your bravery made a person.

1211
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,320
Well done, freedom.

1212
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,080
Oh, yeah. I forgot. I got to thank you.

1213
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,120
I got to show you this. Real quick.

1214
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,440
Yes. All right. We better cover. He's reaching.

1215
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,880
OK. All right. Great.

1216
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,200
What is that?

1217
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,760
Well, it's a new and that's this is an optimist, but it's not for the baby.

1218
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,800
No, it's for me. It's a super seven Optimus Prime toy.

1219
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,080
And now he can be proud of me every day.

1220
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,840
Twenty four seven.

1221
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,440
I was scared to death you were you were reaching back on the floor.

1222
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,960
We're going to pull up a baby.

1223
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,320
Yeah. Been there the whole time.

1224
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,000
I'll show you the baby off air.

1225
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,520
OK. All right. Well, let's get off air then.

1226
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,880
