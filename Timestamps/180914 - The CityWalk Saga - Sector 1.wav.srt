1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A place for roll

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's go take a walk

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's all go to City Walk

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tonight, tonight

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Next to a theme park

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm Scott Gardner, one of the madmen participating in this grand experiment

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The others being Mike Carlson

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hi, yes, this is a terrible idea just in general

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Like, this is ill-advised to people

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We say it to people and they think it's a joke

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It is not a joke, we are doing this 19 days in a row

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're examining all of the stores and restaurants and water fountains for children

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Signage, neon, and you know, the characters hanging off of buildings

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The sidewalk, the actual bricks are up for grabs

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's things to be learned about every single detail of this place

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And we'll probably still not even get through all of it

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, there's no way, I mean there's so much there at City Walk, also

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Also, Jason Sheridan

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hello, you know, there's a saying that goes, fortune favors the bold

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Used by either the British military or the French Foreign Legion

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Or like a coffee ad or something

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or like a coffee ad as well

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's translated from Latin, I forget what the Latin term is

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But you know, I feel like a grand experiment is a good way to put what we're embarking on

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, but I mean, this is the type of thing we need to get into

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We've done, you know, six months of podcasts about rides and stuff that everyone examines

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We decided to take something that universally is regarded as like a hated thing

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Most people say, oh, City Walk is terrible, this is a horrible place

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I disagree with that also, I've always disagreed, I'm on record

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have tweets that go back five, six years saying, I like City Walk

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can find those tweets

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, well, you know what I think I've done throughout my life is pretend I didn't like it

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Made fun of it

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If I wanted to do something there, I would couch it in kind of an ironic way

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wouldn't it be funny to go up to City Walk?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And now after months of this podcast, I feel free to come out of the City Walk closet

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And just own that I always wanted to go there

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Every time, it was genuinely what I wanted

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Amen

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Amen, also

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm scared of being persecuted on this issue of having to go up under slightly false pretenses

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
with friends who know actually what's going on

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And let's clarify, this series is about City Walk at Universal Hollywood

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Not City Walk at Universal Orlando

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That is an entirely different entity

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We will not speak about that at all

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
At all

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is only for Hollywood and yes, now

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That is also lovely, it's a lovely place

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, well in an endeavor like this requires rules and parameters

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right, and which is why, you know, we've carefully caged ourselves in with the 19 part system

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now where did 19 come from?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I feel like because they aren't necessarily all even in the amounts of stores and restaurants

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But there's, I think 19 is a perfect number

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I don't want to question perfection, but if we had to analyze what is it about 19

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why is that the perfect amount?

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You know, one of the impetuses for doing this is that like we met a guy

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think a guy almost undervalues what he is

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A mentor figure maybe or a voice of authority

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Boys

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh yeah, he's here

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A sector keeper?

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know who could have said it better than the man, the being himself

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So yeah, joining us today on the podcast is we call him the sector keeper

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He keeps the different sectors of CityWalk

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Universal CityWalk sector keeper, please

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Universal CityWalk Hollywood sector keeper actually if I may correct you, I'm so sorry

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, my spirit can't cross the country

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You start to dissipate when you hit the Mississippi

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I lose strength, yes

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, so when we talk about 19 sectors, this is sort of a number that's been around for as long as time

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Like the number 23, the significant number of the Jim Carrey film

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
19 is a, it exists in many different codes and it's embedded secretly all over the CityWalk property

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's fair to say, correct?

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, yes

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's another worldly meaning

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
CityWalk is a powerful place, a magical place

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And so you must divide it into sectors to experience more than a sector provides would be dangerous

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, if we have too much fun and too much discussion about like maybe say two sectors at once

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It would be too much for sort of a normal mortal man or woman to handle

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So that's why we've divided it up into different sectors

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because if we were to talk about all of CityWalk at once, who knows what would happen

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know, we would just be exhausted, you know

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Or we'd be here all day, all week

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, and many people in this city or visiting Los Angeles from other cities have gone up to CityWalk

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I can only imagine, I mean there's no wrong way to do CityWalk, but there's also a perfect way to do it

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And it seems to me, SectorKeeper, that by laying out the divine sectors, you are providing your ideal way of experiencing this mall

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I would call it a perfect sort of roadmap

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, look at it as a roadmap, a roadmap that will provide you many things

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Discoveries of popcorn, popcornopolis

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Discoveries of board shorts at Billabong

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Discoveries of watches at Fossil

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Discoveries of water massages at ZenZone

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And discoveries of well-priced women's fashion at Angel

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, just like scarves and stuff?

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, like scarves and dresses

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But at a reasonable price

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fashion forward, but at a reasonable price

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And that is your first sector

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sector 1, Billabong, Popcornopolis, Fossil, ZenZone, and Angel, my boys

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, we're your boys now?

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Venture into the sector, discuss, but be careful

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you go outside of the sector, my spirit will burn in hell

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Wait, what? Oh no, I spit out the drink out of my mouth

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Really? That's what's at stake here?

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes, each sector will help piece together my soul

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Once you accomplish each sector, you will get a sector stone

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
19 sector stones make up my soul

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh my god

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So please go forth, be careful, and I'll be here watching over you as your guardian

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So we're setting you free? Sorry to bring you back real quick

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes, I'm still here

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So we're setting you free? So you can hang out, but we're setting you free basically

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you into Casper where you have unfinished business?

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, I have unfinished business in the city walk

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I can't get into the details, I'll tell you more as you discover more

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But just know that I will go to hell if you don't do this

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, well that's a lot to put on us

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is there a precedent for this? Was there ever a podcast that tried to analyze the King of Prussia mall in Pennsylvania

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and it wasn't done correctly and the King of Prussia sector keeper is stuck in hell now?

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, he's there

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, that exactly happened

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Weird

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean that's the great puzzle of podcasting, conquering the mountain that is the King of Prussia mall

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
As someone who grew up going to the King of Prussia mall complex

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, you did

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh yeah, it's quite a place

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are we now just declaring that we're going to have to eventually tackle this King of Prussia mall?

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I wouldn't

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
To free him? Do you know him? Is he worth freeing?

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, not really

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I mean, let's say you can find good prices on airfare maybe, but don't go out of your way

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, like you don't want, you know, I mean nobody is bad enough to rot in hell, but you know

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're a better guy, you're more worth saving

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes, well I'm not just a guy, I'm a child

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Whoa, what?

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hold on

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What do you mean? What do you mean by that sector keeper?

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You've asked us to be frank with you just as you are with us

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sure, I'll be frank, I'll be straightforward, boys, my boys

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was a child that was playing in the fountain outside of City Walk unsupervised like many children

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The dancing fountains that Abercrombie

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So yeah

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Finch?

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Fitch

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Fitch, not Finch, Fitch

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you've ever been in the City Walk there are these like fountains, there's lights in the floor

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And they shoot up fun little like, you know, streams of water and kids run in and play and they get soaked

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And like parents laugh in delight to see their child have so much fun with what

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sometimes the parents aren't even present, it seems as if the children are just there, but this is a different sector

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes, he's right

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Keep yourself on track

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But yeah, you were in the origin

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you were lost

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You were in the fountain

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, I was in the fountain and my parents wandered over to Bubba Gum Shrimp to put their names in

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I perished

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh my god, whoa, whoa, this is a real downer here

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Is it too much?

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I can't, you know, you can't question this guy's reality

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This kid's reality

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This child's reality

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That was many years ago though, I am ancient

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I guess when I said Casper, it is literally what's going on here, Casper

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Pretty similar to Casper

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Because Casper was a child who was deceased and had unfinished business and

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now he's in hell

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What? Casper is in hell? No, that's not good

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We've established when attractions go away, they go to hell

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh yes, yeah, you've made us aware of this

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've made that point multiple times

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, but Sector Keeper, I mean, I feel like, you know, not everyone listening is as familiar with your kingdom as we are

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So just to reiterate for the listening audience, CityWalk is an outdoor shopping and dining complex next to Universal Studios Hollywood

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I would call it a mixed use area

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's been called a faux street or a lifestyle center

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A faux street and lifestyle center?

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is in an article about the history of it that Scott dug up

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's sort of a popular sort of development style that has grown in Los Angeles with the Grove or the Americana or Hollywood and Island

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Many other major cities have a similar

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Caruso

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What's that?

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Caruso, the man who builds the Grove and the Americana

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, this was a precursor to the Caruso properties

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He was inspired

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Perhaps the Grove and the Americana would not exist without CityWalk

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And the original idea for malls in America were kind of a simulation of like a small town main street

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You know, suburbia, planned communities in the 50s and 60s kind of inspired such a commuter culture, car culture

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That we, America by and large lost that sort of main street drag

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So the original architect who designed the first ideas for malls envisioned sort of an outdoor shopping and dining potentially with housing or services like a post office

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But eventually that was kind of shelved in favor of like the indoor malls that are common throughout America

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Many of them dying as online retailing has caught on

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But those really rose up in the 60s

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And supplanted genuine town squares

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And malls often in suburbia and off to the sides of cities and the outskirts of cities as opposed to in the vital center of a genuine city

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, and I mean this is almost a simulation of like a popular, a populous city street

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Like downtown city center, small town main street

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's like a mutant version of it

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean like Disneyland and main street, you know, is kind of a quaint, tinier scale version of a main street

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The city walk version of like a main street is like giant, gaudy, you know, King Kong

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's like aggressive, it's very, like it is really, I can see, I do really, really like city walk

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But I can see where people like find it nightmarish

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Like, you know, my memories of it is just overwhelming it so much

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's like similar to Vegas maybe

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Dystopian

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, you could say it's dystopian

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I mean I would say, what's like right before dystopian?

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What's the word for that?

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Mid-topia

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Mid-topia

231
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's mid-topian

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Like it's not, like if the King Kong was like, when we finally get into like a horrible war and like King Kong is blown up and his head is off the sign and stuff

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That'll be fully dystopian

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Like that would be the scariest place to be, is like a dead mall or a dead theme park

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, this is related to the fact, I don't know if this is the same article you were pulling from

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I read a genuinely cool article from PBS about the rise of city walk in the wake of boxed-in malls

238
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And how they were like kind of sleek and Jetsons-esque when they started

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And then by the 80s they were sort of growing predictable and homogenized and kind of just dull, not fun places to be

240
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And they brought up the, is it Dawn of the Dead?

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, that takes place in a mall

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, where it becomes this realm of horror where it's like a refuge for people but they end up feeling trapped

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think people started feeling like boxed-in closed, it just became like a very stale format by the 80s

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And the people were looking for ways to revitalize this concept

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And so that's where we enter the architect or the designer, the man behind city walk, John Jurdy

246
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He's the, I mean the sector keeper, your...

247
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Father

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes, yeah, I was curious about, it's kind of a holy trinity thing

249
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You are he and he is you, but you're separate entities as well

250
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And one day we'll send someone in our image down to city walk

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
A third entity who is a combo of John Jurdy, a deceased architect, and you who are...

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A deceased child who drowned in dancing fountains

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And who somehow preceded the existence of the fountains

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You were there before it, but it was there before you as well

255
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Precisely, Scott

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is duality to the fountain origin story

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes, speak of Father, please

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes, well he's a great man

259
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Here's where, this is so genuinely my wheelhouse because I'm a fan of architecture and a fan of malls

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And let me say what this guy, what John Jurdy is behind

261
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We're talking Glendale Galleria

262
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah

263
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We're talking, this is for my Valley or my LA Orange County people more so

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The Northridge Fashion Center mall that was savagely destroyed by the Northridge earthquake

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But came back and is stronger than ever today

266
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
City Walk notably survived the Northridge earthquake

267
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't think anything particularly happened up there

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, congrats, it was built to last

269
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Well it had the eternal powers on its side

270
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You got Fashion Island which is down in Newport Beach

271
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That was a boring boxed in mall that was starting to bum people out

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And he added all of the outdoor streets and corridors all around it

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
All of this stuff very European, it's like trying to create little tiny European towns in boring Orange County mall areas

274
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And then in Las Vegas, Treasure Island is this man

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Wow, really?

276
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is like the Tony Baxter of malls

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's absolutely correct

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Not only that, he and Tony Baxter were friends

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

281
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yep, I found that out this morning

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I read John Jurdy's eulogy or what's an article in a newspaper

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
An obituary

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
An obituary, you are wise and all knowing, thank you Sector Keeper

285
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I read his obituary which was written by a long time Disney Imagineer

286
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Who talked about how John Jurdy came and spoke to them

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And he spoke to them from what he truly is

288
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
A father of mixed use retail space

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But I think he took Imagineers on a tour of the West Edmonton Mall

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He and Tony Baxter led a walk around

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And they talked about, which is another, that's one of the biggest malls in North America

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And Tony Baxter learned from his teachings

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Truly a Christ-like figure, it's true

294
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He also designed the color scheme and all of the temporary, what do you call it?

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The temporary stuff, I don't know what the hell is the word

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Temporary stuff

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm no architect, but temporary stuff into Olympic Village in 1984

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Which in Los Angeles

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Temporary modular buildings

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

301
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Things that were like a bunch of flags and peach triangles flapping around in the wind

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Which is so my aesthetic

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Decoration is another good word

304
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I wish I always had somebody here to give me vocabulary words

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So I didn't just say stuff and things

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This is exceedingly helpful

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But anyway, all of these temporary decorations for the LA Summer Olympics

308
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Which all moved when it was done to Videopolis

309
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So you got some John Jertie stuff intermingling with the parks

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And then here's something I didn't know until today

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It was pretty mind-blowing

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
John Jertie, years before City Walk, designed something called

313
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And you know it, you could say it with me

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Satellite Newtown

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There you go, I knew you knew it

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Satellite Newtown was a shopping complex

317
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Designed by John Jertie

318
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Which was supposed to be the mixed-use shopping development surrounding Euro Disney

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh my god

320
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Disney Village, which we maligned for over two hours on a recent episode

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Would have been designed by the man who designed City Walk

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And in fact, many of the ideas he had, he was able to finally implement in City Walk

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So that, as I said, the least magical mall in all of Disney-dom

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It could have been a City Walk

325
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It could have been the first one

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It could have been a City Walk

327
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's almost like we've been called to this place by the things we love

328
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's almost like you were with us all this time, Sector Keeper

329
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Every time you've purchased a snack or

330
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Validated parking

331
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Validated parking or went to see an IMAX premiere of a Marvel movie

332
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've been by your side

333
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's actually very comforting to know

334
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, and listeners, lest you think like a lot of

335
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What do we care about Southern California malls?

336
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A lot of the places we named Glendale Galleria, the Northwich Fashion Square

337
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are so close to the movie studios, often used as locations

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
In television and film

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So you've likely seen or experienced these places

340
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
These places have likely implemented, implanted in your minds, excuse me

341
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
As an idea of like a mall or a retail center

342
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The idea of somebody who's made so many malls

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Like I immediately I don't know why this is

344
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is just some like baby boomer bullshit in my head

345
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But like I start thinking of his malls as different albums

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So like he's U2, like the Galleria might be like Joshua Tree

347
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's a real classic, it's good, it's very

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It works very much as a standard mall

349
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But like City Walk Hollywood is like U2's pop

350
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And some people don't like it

351
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's a lot, it's a body, it's in your face

352
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's abrasive but it's risky

353
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But it's risky, City Walk is more of a risk

354
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's a different type of it

355
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's a later part of his career I think

356
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I think because of sure

357
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
How would you then rank, I left a few out

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I left a major one out

359
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The Mall of fucking America

360
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Really, he was the Mall of America guy

361
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So what's that in U2?

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
No, I said Joshua Tree Galleria

363
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What's the biggest U2 album?

364
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, Octon Baby is my favorite

365
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But maybe that would be like a double album

366
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
U2 never really had like a double album

367
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So I mean maybe

368
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The Mall of America is so good

369
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's as good as a non-existent U2 double album done at their peak

370
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Something they were too lazy to get around to doing

371
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
John Jertie did, it's called The Mall of America

372
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Which album is stuck in the moment on?

373
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's from All That You Can't Leave Behind in 2000

374
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's when they came back with Beautiful Day

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's sort of your return to form album

376
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Did he have a return to form where he made like kind of a Galleria type?

377
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like it was a later period but sort of a standard mall

378
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It wasn't very risky

379
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know if this qualifies as that but

380
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Maybe the Bellagio

381
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh really?

382
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I saw a sketch today of that main atrium

383
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That they change out for every season in the Bellagio

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And I saw this guy hand sketch what that was going to look like

385
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So that's a good, that's like a later, an essential piece

386
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Many years after what you might think would be the peak

387
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And by the way, Sector Keeper, you know, you're very busy

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You've had a lot going on over all these years

389
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But there were Sam Goodies back in the 2000s at CityWalk

390
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You know, you should have checked out U2 while you had the chance

391
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I know, I regret it

392
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
There's digital ways

393
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You could still listen to U2 though, the albums are available

394
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
No, I can't

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Not until you free me

396
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh man, you can't listen to music until we free you?

397
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You can only hear Despacito or whatever loop they're playing up at CityWalk

398
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I can only hear what's being played at CityWalk

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So you probably know a lot of like top 40, you know, broad stage urine kind of

400
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes, but don't ask me too many questions about it

401
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay, sounds good, yeah, we don't want to get too off track

402
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We have a lot to cover

403
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You're not a music guy, you're a mall spirit

404
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No, I'm a spirit, yes

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You're a mall spirit

406
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But you try to be aware of other topics

407
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Right, and sometimes it just sounds like a cacophony of sounds

408
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because many of the different buildings are playing their own music

409
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So Margaritaville will be playing Mr. Buffett's music

410
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And The Raiders Store will be playing its own music

411
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The Raiders Fight Song

412
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The Raiders Fight Song over again

413
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And you just see how those two things mix together and it just sounds like a disaster

414
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That's a note that I wrote down when I, this is a different sector

415
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So I'll keep it fast, please don't punish me

416
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But I had a brief meal at Wasabi and I jotted down that CityWalk is truly the capital, the world capital of competing music

417
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Which on the Hard Rock, we talked on the episode and that was, and I'm forgetting the man's name, Hard Rock Park guy

418
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Who created the park

419
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
John Binkowski, right?

420
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
John Binkowski, yes

421
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
John Binkowski was very proud of his theme park for not having music bleed

422
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He would have a fucking fit if he went to CityWalk

423
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Maybe he's been, maybe that's part of why he inspired it

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You know, I made fun of that music bleeding thing

425
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But now when you go to a place that is full of music bleed, it does show not that there's anything wrong with it

426
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
CityWalk is perfect

427
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We don't want to offend you, Sectorkeeper, by saying there's too much sound bleed

428
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But you know, if we had a minor note, that might be it, one of them

429
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's okay, thank you

430
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm open to constructive feedback

431
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's very good

432
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I thought you'd be upset about that

433
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm open to it

434
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm a yesander

435
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I took, I took classes at UCB

436
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh wow, really?

437
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Still got a chance

438
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's good

439
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's great, yeah

440
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Jason and I did a couple years ago

441
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Okay

442
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, I guess he doesn't want to talk about that anymore

443
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm impressed

444
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
With, you know, that's fair

445
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Everyone in the city says they do UCB now

446
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So according to their resumes

447
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If I can use sound bleed as a jumping off point into our first sector of discussion

448
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Absolutely

449
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Boys, I'm getting weak

450
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Please

451
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We have to talk

452
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Please discuss Sector 1

453
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Uh huh

454
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah, so we went and experienced Sector 1

455
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes

456
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
May I remind you what Sector 1 is?

457
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes, please

458
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Sector 1, Billabong, Popcornopolis, Fossil, Zenzone, Angel

459
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes, and the

460
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Thank you, Sectorkeeper

461
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The, you know, the sound bleed we definitely experienced at the Zenzone

462
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I felt like

463
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, I see what you're saying

464
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So we're going to start, do you want to start with Zenzone?

465
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Do you want to start or should we build?

466
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Is that allowed?

467
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Or do we have to go in order?

468
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Do we have to go in order?

469
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That gives me strength, yes

470
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Start with Zenzone

471
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So we're going, yeah, we'll start with Zenzone

472
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So yeah, so the Zenzone, we had to put a little teaser in

473
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is how I always start with Zenzone

474
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Is a place we could go in a coffin and get massaged by water

475
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's what it looked like to me

476
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It was like this big weird thing where they would put like a half MRI machine down on you

477
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And then somehow water would massage you

478
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I never went in there, I never

479
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We were curious to go in there

480
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We were never curious, yeah, I was like, ah, that must be just some, like

481
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Like I never got a massage at a shopping mall

482
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah

483
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like, which is always like, I just, I don't know, my brain doesn't even think about it

484
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Without even, it's just, there's no door, there's no back area of this massage place

485
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's just facing out to the open marketplace of CityWug

486
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Right, so

487
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, this is not a traditional like massage place with private rooms

488
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Where you strip down to a level you're comfortable with and then aren't solid

489
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's one of the things it says, I should have, I don't have it written down

490
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But it says like, keep your clothes on

491
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Keep your clothes on and also you will not get wet

492
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Because everyone thinks like, oh, I'm going to get drenched

494
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Right, which I think you would prefer because you love to get wet at a theme park

495
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, I love to get wet, yeah

496
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But this is not the case, it's basically like there's water jets

497
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But there's like this like kind of tarp thing that separates you from the water

498
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And it massages you through it

499
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So you're basically getting hit by the tarp

500
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like the tarp is massaging you

501
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah

502
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But it's using the pressure of the water that's shooting

503
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We'll put a picture of this on because it might be confusing

504
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Like a power washer shooting at your body

505
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yes, thank you, that, yes, exactly

506
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
With a tarp in between

507
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And yes, the tarp in between is making sure that you're not wet

508
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's like you're driving through a car wash

509
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, right, and because it goes up and down your body

510
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And you're on your stomach like you would be

511
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Now we've all experienced this

512
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We all went and did this

513
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We all went and did it

514
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
We all went and did it, yes

515
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And my wife came and took some photographs

516
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Which will be up on the Twitter, you're welcome

517
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
She said before we went

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, I got to go and get pictures of you guys in like the aqua suits

519
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I think in her mind we were going to put on some weird like

520
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh, oh

521
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Blue tarp suits

522
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So everyone is unclear of what before this we started

523
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
No one knew quite how this worked

524
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, and unfortunately we don't have photos of us in aqua superhero wardrobe

525
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We just wear our regular clothes, which is very convenient

526
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, and then obviously it's designed for somebody who's like walking away from the park or to the park

527
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Because they don't there's no time for anything here with a massage

528
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
There's no time to put a towel on you

529
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Like they want to make sure if there's a demand

530
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Which we'll get to in a second

531
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
There will not be a demand

532
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
There very rarely seems to be a demand at this place

533
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And we should mention we beat it open

534
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We were there before it opened

535
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We even gave them all time City Walk opened at 10

536
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We were there at 1030

537
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
When 11 rolled around it's still not open

538
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Just rolling up the doors

539
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We were like lazily open around 11

540
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We were able to

541
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What's that?

542
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I went recently

543
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh you popped in

544
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Michael brought me

545
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah so

546
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What you guys were hanging out without me?

547
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So basically so yeah so we went yesterday

548
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The sector keeper couldn't make it yesterday

549
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He was busy

550
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Understandably

551
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm not sure what it was he can if he wants to explain he can

552
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But yeah so we went again today I took him today

553
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Or he was there already excuse me

554
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So I didn't go back in there but he experienced it again

555
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Our associate said I'm so glad you're here

556
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I haven't talked to anyone today

557
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah so the gentleman that was helping us there

558
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Very nice yeah he was

559
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He clearly wanted to talk to another human being

560
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No one had been in there

561
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Which is the same thing we had found yesterday

562
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well we were the first ones there

563
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We were the first ones there

564
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So yeah especially in the morning this place is a low trafficked place

565
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And we have to give credit to the woman working there when we were there

566
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
She was very nice she gave us extra time

567
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah so we were trying

568
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So we're breaking it down like there's different like it's you can do a seven minute version of it

569
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You can do a ten minute version you can do fifteen

570
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So we're trying to break down with her

571
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Like so what's the difference like do you get an extra relaxing one if it's ten minutes and she's like no it's just longer

572
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Like fifteen minutes is just the same thing but it's longer

573
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And it's like okay well then we'll just do the short one

574
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And she's like no one's here we'll give you extra time

575
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Which I wasn't quite clear on so I was expecting a seven minute massage

576
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes and then his time is dragging out it's like

577
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Did they forget about me?

578
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes I have noise cancelling headphones on has some apocalypse occurred and I'm just left here

579
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's funny because the sector keeper said the same thing this morning when we were there

580
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He said he expected to come out and the whole world was different

581
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I was like in rags or something like come on we have to go there's a there's an attack of some kind

582
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It does feel fitting that we were all essentially baptized to begin this journey

583
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes

584
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Father was happy

585
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Father was pleased with that

586
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Father was pleased

587
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Bless you John thank you John

588
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Bless you John thank you John

589
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah so she opens up this like this top of this like it looks kind of like a tanning bed basically

590
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
She opens up the top and so she loads yesterday we were talking about yesterday

591
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
She loads the three of us on them

592
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Three of the four of these and we're immediately taking up three of the four spots

593
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Which maybe has not happened in weeks at ZenZone

594
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah this is the most anyone's ever talked about ZenZone too at this point

595
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We've already hit the record

596
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And no one's ever talked more about it than this

597
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So yeah so we get face down and she puts these noise canceling headphones on

598
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And she tells me there's two buttons

599
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
One button is to stop the jets

600
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So say the jet hits you in the lower back and man does that feel good

601
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You hit the button and you use a blast your lower back with water

602
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The other button is to stop the thing if something's going wrong or you feel scared or something

603
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And I love the fact that the button to stop it is a big comical red button

604
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think that which is a great design I mean it's hard to mess up

605
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes but it looks like Wile E. Coyote has one of his controls

606
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
When he was trying to blow the Roadrunner up he would hit this button

607
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Very ACME

608
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah ACME branded buttons

609
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So the three of us load in which has to be a funny photo

610
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Is there a picture of all three of our heads sticking out somewhere?

611
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah all of us with the headphones on face down

612
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Because you're in the regular massage chair

613
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Help me with vocabulary again if you can with this little donut opening

614
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The Zen Zone

615
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Oh that's the zone, it's the hole in the face rest

616
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If you get like a sitting massage or like a face down massage

617
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah there's usually a hole for your face sort of thing

618
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
This is like being massaged by the ocean

619
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
By the ocean

620
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So we're in there for a while because we all thought we were doing 7 minutes

621
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Or when she said I'll give you a little extra I thought she would give us like maybe 10

622
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
5 minutes yeah so like extra 10, 11, 12

623
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
At a certain point I went I've been in here for 30 minutes

624
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It feels like I've been in here for a half hour

625
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't know if that's true we never actually confirmed how long it was

626
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That would have been a good question

627
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
By the least Scott's way I said it was about 20 minutes

628
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh it was 20 okay

629
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
How long was the sector keeper in?

630
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh today so I think that you were in I think it was 15 minutes

631
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
15 or so

632
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But also all eternity

633
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But also we were supposed to be in there for 10

634
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But yeah so I think it's just when it's running low

635
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
They will really give you a deal they'll give you a nice the nice thing

636
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So show up at opening that's your city walk

637
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's a good tip

638
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah get there not at 10 it's not going to be open at 10

639
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But when they like decide to show up for an 11

640
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Which I you know hey I can't fault them for the late entry

641
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Because they were so awesome once we were doing it

642
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And also most of the other stores we tried to go to before 11 had not yet opened

643
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah I mean they obviously know the audience

644
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
They know that there's not a line forming outside ZenZone at 10am every day at City Walk

645
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They've probably figured this out through trial and error

646
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Even Popcornopolis I may have been the first customer of the day at like 11.30 or something

647
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That's not the first time that's happened though

648
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
All right

649
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Zing I got you

650
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Sector keeper likes that

651
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Right

652
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He's like 10 mega clouds

653
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Jason yelling let me in outside Popcornopolis

654
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah no no of course not no one does that

655
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No one lines up outside City Walk they're trying to get to the park

656
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The theme park

657
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That's a thing you know a lot of these stores certainly at 10 in the morning

658
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You'd have to regard as you know essentially flyover states in store form

659
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes

660
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
They're being blasted through

661
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You know what I missed by the way entirely in the history of it is that

662
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Like they basically like needed a path that would get you from the parking garages to the park

663
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
There may have been some I forget where you parked initially in the early days of the pre City Walk days

664
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The shameful pre City Walk days

665
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But also the path was set up to connect the theme park to the movie theater

666
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And the movie theater never moved

667
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's a strange thing about it

668
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But like cars used to drive right out front of it

669
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Like that was just a regular street up there

670
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So the whole impetus of City Walk besides to create a glorious Xanadu of perfection

671
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Was to connect the movie theater to the theme park

672
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Much like the time lapse footage of cities growing or like the opening sequence of Up

673
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Where a city of rises around Carl's little home

674
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
City Walk rose from the ground

675
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I can't wait to see Up

676
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
When we say you're free you can do it

677
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
There's so much great pop culture

678
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm familiar but haven't seen it

679
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You get to see posters but not the actual films or listen to the records

680
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So you know you pretty much know of many things

681
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You don't know a lot of things specifically

682
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah you'll eventually

683
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I mean what's big in the 2000s

684
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You got a couple of those Da Vinci Code movies

685
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Angels and Demons I think was great

686
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Robert Langdon yes

687
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You got a lot to look forward to there

688
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah 2000 era I mean Bruce Springsteen album The Rising

689
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Sort of the back of the E Street band he came back with them

690
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The White Stripes Lego music video

691
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Ah fun

692
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We fell in love with a girl

693
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The Strokes I guess

694
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Cool

695
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They were a good band

696
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
This show called Will and Grace was on for a long time

697
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And then they went away and then came back

698
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It was a show not just with one actor

699
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It was an ensemble show

700
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You got all kinds of things

701
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We'll try to motor through this whole series

702
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You see how necessary it is right

703
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
We're trying to set your soul free

704
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
We're moving I think as fast as we possibly could through all of these stores

705
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think everyone listening would agree we're gunning it

706
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So yeah Zenzone I guess

707
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes thank you we're back

708
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah I mean I think we all two different

709
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think we all kind of agreed like oh that was nice

710
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It was pretty pleasant

711
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah so yeah you're in there and you're face down and the thing is going up

712
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And at first yeah like it's odd you get used to it

713
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Because you're getting shot by a tarp

714
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Like you're getting watered

715
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Water via a tarp I don't know which better way to put it

716
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Very repetitive

717
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes it's the same up and down up and down

718
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And it tickled my legs and feet

719
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That was the thing that happened

720
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But then she came by and she goes

721
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Do you want it harder

722
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I said yes I do

723
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So she cranked it up on me

724
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
As did I

725
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And Jason also requested it harder

726
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Scott did you ask for harder

727
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I did not I don't remember being asked

728
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Did she ask you

729
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Maybe not

730
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
She may have noticed

731
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
We were also using the

732
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I was using the button a lot

733
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I was really focusing it on my shoulders

734
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Were you using a button either

735
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I tried it once and I don't think it stopped it

736
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I don't think it stopped

737
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
On a pressure point

738
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But I kind of wanted

739
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I got accustomed to it but I initially

740
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Hated it like the first few seconds

741
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I looked up at my wife

742
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like oh god get me out of this thing

743
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But by the end

744
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
After you know

745
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
500 back and forth

746
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
If you ticklish like the key

747
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
If you ticklish like the keeper

748
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Is

749
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The leg section is tough

750
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah yeah yeah

751
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
When it like traveled

752
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Like you know

753
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The up top

754
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Midpoint the butt and the feet

755
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I felt great but the middle

756
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Runs I had a hard time

757
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Not to be crass but I think it really

758
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Tickled my bottom

759
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Now that's not crass

760
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Look I noticed that about myself as well

761
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I was feeling very ticklish on the bottom

762
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I think that it like

763
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It was like jostling and like you could

764
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If you I would stop it in certain

765
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Places and one time I did like stop it right

766
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
In the middle

767
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's not a bad

768
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Tickling no and I wasn't trying to do

769
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
A sex thing or anything I was just like

770
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Trying to like stop it in places and see how

771
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It would feel or whatever and I think I got it right

772
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
In the middle of the butt and that

773
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes that is I

774
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Probably giggled I think

775
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
My nose cancelling headphones

776
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Didn't let me know you couldn't know how embarrassing

777
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The noise I had made was

778
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Now the sound bleed I had mentioned earlier

779
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I had to say at some point they

780
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Turned on what I can only describe as

781
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Zen house music oh yeah and

782
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I was hearing that and

783
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
A little bit of the city walk

784
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Ambience

785
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Like through

786
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The headphones but that

787
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
May also have been because I experienced

788
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Something I don't know that you guys did

789
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Being a shorter man

790
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I kept scooching backwards

791
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
To get further into the

792
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Coffin

793
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Because I wanted it to get my neck

794
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But then when I got it to a spot

795
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Where it would hit my neck and upper shoulders

796
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It was knocking against the headphones

797
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I think it knocked the headphones loose

798
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
A little okay this makes a lot of sense

799
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Because I got out first

800
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So I got out first and you guys had a couple minutes

801
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Left yeah because it kind of staggered us

802
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Getting in so we all got out within a few

803
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Minutes of each other right so I'm

804
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Looking at both of you guys heads face down

805
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And Scott just looks his head is face down and not

806
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Moving I looked at you you look like

807
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You were getting pummeled you look

808
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like you were rattling like I guess it's to the higher

809
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Water pressure but I was like it looks

810
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Like somebody's beating him up like face

811
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Down someone's punching you in the head

812
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I was trying to get it like on

813
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
My shoulder and I felt

814
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Great like for much

815
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Of the rest of the day although I woke up this morning

816
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And a different part of my

817
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Shoulders felt like shit now that

818
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
May have just been I was tossing and turning at night

819
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't want to chalk that up entirely

820
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
To the Zen zone but

821
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I did think like a lying

822
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's not the Zen zone okay

823
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But when I got out of the coffin

824
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I did find like where

825
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The capsule I guess coffin is

826
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
A little it's also like a little like the photon

827
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Torpedo when they put Spock in at the

828
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
End of search or the

829
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
End of Wrath of Khan when he dies and they put him

830
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
In the photon torpedo and shoot him out which by

831
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
The way is a crazy way to send a man

832
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
To bury a man

833
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is to shoot him out in a torpedo

834
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Where do you get into the space

835
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Shoot him into space I mean it's search

836
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
For Spock like they have to find it which is

837
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Why don't you just keep his corpse around

838
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Which doesn't make any sense but anyway

839
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's similar it felt similar to that like

840
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I was being loaded into a torpedo I was

841
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Buried in

842
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
In the Zen zone oh

843
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
In one of the it was used as a coffin that was

844
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
My coffin oh my god yes

845
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well one thing

846
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The associate told us when

847
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Michael and I visited is that

848
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
For a used capsule

849
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's sixteen thousand dollars

850
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
For a new one it is twenty five thousand

851
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Dollars yeah we talked about

852
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The new you found out the prices of yes

853
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The sector keeper was the one who asked the question

854
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I thought it was actually a very good question because the

855
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Machines look a little old to me too it looks like

856
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I think sector keeper pointed out this

857
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Looked like something that would be in Barbara Streisand's house

858
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
In 1992 like

859
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Like a rich person would be like

860
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
This is how I relax this new fangled

861
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Piece of technology

862
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Which I think is very accurate I think

863
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It was an early city walk

864
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Location I don't know if it's been there since opening

865
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But it's been a long time through all

866
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Of the two thousands it would seem

867
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah it's a very it's a sharper image

868
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Kind of yes extremity

869
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah

870
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Would

871
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Would you get one would anyone

872
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Get one I would

873
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What if it cost more reasonable

874
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
What if it cost a thousand

875
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Dollars well I'm very

876
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So you're so you're set

877
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't know

878
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I mean I liked it

879
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I don't know if I would do it all

880
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The time it's got look it takes up a lot

881
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Of room first of all a lot of room

882
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And you need a voltage

883
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Converter the associate told me

884
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Is that did you ask

885
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I did ask that yes

886
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So they have that built

887
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Into the side yes I would be interested

888
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
To see I would have to try

889
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I would just go back to the Zen zone and try it a few more

890
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Times to really see if I could get the most of it

891
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Like I would be interested to like to see if

892
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I could turn a little bit of my side see if I could get it

893
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
To like hit me at different angles I

894
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Would love to see if we could crank it up even more than

895
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
What the water pressure was like let's

896
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
See how far we can take this like let's see

897
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
If it actually like if because they probably

898
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Don't want you getting hurt in there obviously

899
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But maybe if it was a little higher water

900
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Pressure like it would really like work some stuff

901
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Because I didn't feel like when I would stop it on certain

902
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Points in my back I'd be like man that is

903
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Like stretching me out like yeah

904
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So I don't know I mean I

905
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Found also I didn't think

906
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Was outrageously priced I mean

907
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Everywhere around here you have to

908
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Account for like a theme park

909
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Tax like you have to pay a little more of a

910
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Premium yes and

911
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And what happens is which they don't tell

912
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You and this happened to

913
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Me and then to you guys after you got

914
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Out is that you're not

915
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Only getting just the water massage

916
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
When you go in there there are some

917
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Little add-ons perks that perks

918
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Yes that they give you and they don't

919
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Even ask you if you want them they just start

920
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Doing stuff to you yeah

921
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Little massage rollers little

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Head scratchers yes are getting sprayed

923
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Down you get sprayed down I wasn't

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Marbles on you they put marbles on you

925
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I wasn't even doing anything today I was

926
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Just sitting and watching the sector keeper enjoying

927
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
His aqua massage and

928
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
The the gentleman came over and he

929
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Goes I'll hold your hands on I go what and he's just

930
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Just spraying me down and I was like oh I'm

931
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay I'm doing this too I guess

932
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So like they will just

933
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Aromatherapy

934
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So yeah so what happened yesterday is I was done

935
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And I decided to spend the extra ten dollars

936
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And do the oxygen bar as well

937
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
A real holdover from

938
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The early to mid

939
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
2000s oxygen bars were

940
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
The hit of the Jersey Shore for a

941
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Couple of oh really yeah did you ever

942
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Go as a you know absolutely not okay

943
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But the the parents no no

944
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
No no no okay it was a very

945
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It was a trendy thing

946
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It was a trendy thing I think

947
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
People some people maybe it made them a little

948
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Little light headed yeah well oxygen

949
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Makes you high I learned that from Brad

950
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Pitt and Fight Club

951
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah I think from the plate

952
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Right they pump in oxygen if the mass

953
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Comes down yes Tyler Durden

954
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Tyler Durden yeah so where's the movie

955
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You're gonna love it sector keeper yeah

956
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
He says that you're as peaceful as you do

957
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
In the behalf of Choke as a kid but

958
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh wow that's one of the things you got

959
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Before the accident yes

960
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh okay looked up shit before your

961
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Spirit ascended yeah that's a

962
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Bummer I'm sorry it's okay okay

963
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So you did the Electroshock

964
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Thing you did the oxygen bar

965
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I got the oxygen bar I chose Bayberry

966
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
As the flavor of oxygen

967
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Because I wanted to revitalize

968
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It was the silly I always do that I picked the

969
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Silliest name I wanted to revitalize which is what it

970
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Said it would do to me and then they like

971
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
She like

972
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
She gives me basically what you

973
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Wear when you need oxygen in the hospital

974
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Which is scary I thought it was

975
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Gonna be like a fun caterpillar hookah

976
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Like I'm gonna have this long thing and I'm gonna take

977
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Puffs and I'll be very provisorial

978
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
No it's an oxygen line

979
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It's like a plastic oxygen line that goes into your nostrils

980
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah these two little things that go into oxygen

981
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I sent a text to my girlfriend Lindsay

982
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And she goes oh my god it looks like you're sick

983
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And I was like yeah it does and it's like

984
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's a very weird look and I'm like

985
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Just looking out onto all the people

986
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That are walking to the theme park and I have this thing

987
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Stuck in my nose and I'm just inhaling

988
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Bayberry

989
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But to give again to give them credit

990
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I didn't really feel like

991
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Upsold

992
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
They had lots of

993
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Kitchy holistic crap

994
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
In there and they did not really

995
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Like push that hard

996
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So after so I'm doing this and then she comes over

997
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And she just starts with these like weird what did you call

998
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Marble what it like it's like a weird

999
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Massager attached to a glove

1000
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Something my mom would have bought

1001
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
In 1998 or something like

1002
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Most of the technology seems like it's a little

1003
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Old

1004
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yes yes

1005
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
They buy all their stuff from

1006
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Brookstone and she starts rubbing my back

1007
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And I was like oh okay and I'm like oh no

1008
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Is this going to be like there's

1009
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We'll see on the bill like three dollars for

1010
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Rubbing you with marbles you know two

1011
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Dollars for whatever for rubbing

1012
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Your head with that weird like I don't even

1013
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Know what to call it like these like pronged

1014
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
This pronged thing that they started rubbing all of our

1015
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Heads with

1016
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That old timey

1017
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Brain and head shape science

1018
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
That is not

1019
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Phrenology

1020
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah it seemed like a phrenology implement

1021
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Like they were measuring us for some reason

1022
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Head scratching calipers

1023
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
My mom does have that

1024
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That a head thing not the measuring thing

1025
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
The actual head

1026
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Massager she didn't like make you compete

1027
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
With your sister

1028
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
No no no

1029
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
No she was not like that

1030
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
She would never do that

1031
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So yeah I thought that was all going to be

1032
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Added up and they also

1033
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Hooked electrodes to my back

1034
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This is again and they did this to me

1035
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Again today even though I wasn't buying

1036
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Anything they just hooked this

1037
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Gentleman hooked things to me again

1038
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And the sector keeper as well

1039
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So in the last 48 hours

1040
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And set it to 40 minutes

1041
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah he would have let us

1042
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Sit there getting electrocuted

1043
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
We excused ourselves

1044
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I almost did that when I was

1045
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Up there like I almost said like

1046
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh you know what I gotta use the bathroom can I

1047
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Pay can I cash out

1048
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah I was getting antsy and

1049
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Aaron's plan

1050
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Was to like go into the park for a second

1051
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And go on you know one of the rides

1052
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
That's 20 feet away

1053
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But she's initially like oh 7 minutes

1054
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I'll just wait around and then we're there for a full hour

1055
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
She could have gone on Harry Potter twice

1056
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
This was like Zen Zone

1057
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Is the equivalent of like

1058
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
A lonely guy who just

1059
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Wants to hang cause like

1060
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yesterday again they didn't say

1061
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Like oh would you like complimentary

1062
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Electrode service where we electrocute

1063
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
The muscles by your neck and shoulders

1064
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
All of a sudden she's just like oh hold on a second

1065
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And I'm like wait one second

1066
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Like sticking things to my back and then I go

1067
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Like this thing just like

1068
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Jolts you every couple seconds and you

1069
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Have a little thing that can

1070
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Control how strong it was

1071
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So the Sector Keeper and I today were trying to see

1072
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
How hard we could go with it

1073
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And it goes up to what 10?

1074
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yes Sector

1075
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Keeper could only handle 7 Sector

1076
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Keeper went up to 7 I tried 7 for

1077
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
A second and it was like I was

1078
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Being tortured like

1079
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It was no fooling like you could

1080
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You could get information out of somebody

1081
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
By using this thing also

1082
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
The control looked like a Sony

1083
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
MP3 player yes

1084
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We had 10 years ago oh so yesterday

1085
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah so yesterday I had one that was wired

1086
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Today we had bluetooth controlled

1087
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So he used the better tech on us

1088
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And we were holding this little thing

1089
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And he set it to 40 minutes yesterday I think mine was set

1090
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
To 30 minutes and I was like 30 minutes

1091
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
When you're just with losers like

1092
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Us you don't get the full bluetooth treatment

1093
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
But when you're hanging with the Sector Keeper

1094
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
He's just trying to impress him

1095
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I think the gentleman today also liked us

1096
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
A lot I think he was very interested

1097
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
In the woman yesterday very friendly

1098
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Very friendly very nice guy he kind of

1099
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Clasped my hand a little bit when

1100
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
He put the control in my hand yes

1101
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yes very

1102
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Just a massage therapist

1103
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Vibe yes and he actually

1104
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I think was he targeted

1105
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So yeah so I'm sitting there waiting for the Sector Keeper

1106
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
To finish and all of a sudden

1107
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
He just comes over and sprays me down

1108
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And he's like oh uh uh uh uh cause then

1109
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm like oh is he gonna give me a charge? Did he ask if you were

1110
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Allergic cause they asked me yesterday

1111
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
He just could tell

1112
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This guy's been at it so long he can tell

1113
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
What my allergies are so all of a sudden

1114
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
He just comes over and he goes oh turn around

1115
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And I go oh okay and then he puts I'm like oh

1116
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Fuck I'm getting electrocuted again

1117
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm getting more he just snuck you

1118
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Into it without your consent

1119
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He warmed up a uh

1120
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
A shoulder pillow and put it on

1121
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Our shoulders we both got shoulder

1122
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Pillows and we're getting electrocuted and he's like so what do you do

1123
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And we're like oh okay

1124
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Like and we're like he's just

1125
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Like this it's like the same you heard

1126
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
The trick where when you see like a person outside

1127
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
A supermarket that wants to sell you something or get a donation

1128
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
The trick is you put a book

1129
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
In their hand cause then the book sort of

1130
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Ties you to that person so you don't

1131
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Leave them and then they can give you the whole spiel

1132
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Of whatever they're trying to sell you or something and then

1133
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
At that point like hopefully you just fork over

1134
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Money or agree to something he has a different

1135
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Tactic it's put a warm heating

1136
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Pad on the shoulders and an electrocuter

1137
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
On their back

1138
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And they can't go anywhere they ain't running

1139
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Into the theme park they're not going across the way

1140
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We were stuck there

1141
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It's only it's not in pursuit of more money

1142
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Cause you didn't pay more money it wasn't in

1143
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Pursuit of company yes

1144
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Cause that's what I was like oh no is he gonna like charge me

1145
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Like ten dollars now cause like yesterday

1146
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Cause like yesterday your wife

1147
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Erin did not

1148
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
No one came by her and was like sit down

1149
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Here I'm putting a thing on you it was like clearly

1150
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Like oh she's not doing a service not the

1151
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Case for me I got the full

1152
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Extra treatment other than

1153
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Being in the water coffin

1154
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It was so and then not

1155
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
You didn't pay a cent

1156
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I did not I mean I tipped now I had

1157
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
The tip extra which is the whole thing because

1158
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If somebody does a sort of a free service

1159
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I still feel like oh I got a tip probably what the tip

1160
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Would have been if I had the service

1161
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I the sector keeper feels

1162
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
He was happy

1163
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
The employee was happy that

1164
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We were sober

1165
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Cause he told a tale of a

1166
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Drunk man who went into the

1167
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Water coffin and shot

1168
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Out like superman

1169
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah he was drunk and he

1170
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Crawled out the front and like before

1171
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It was over before he was sober he used his

1172
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Arms to just propel himself out of

1173
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It and so I think he

1174
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Was happy yeah he was

1175
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Did he pee on his way out

1176
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
He leave a trail he did not

1177
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Mention any Erin but he said that was the

1178
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Craziest thing that he had ever seen is a

1179
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Man drunk crawling his way

1180
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Out the front which if you see well you see this photo

1181
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It's a pretty small opening

1182
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And you shouldn't do it he should have just hit the

1183
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Comically large acme stop button

1184
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Right so yeah we

1185
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Were very calm he did other guys

1186
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Came in though yes and did

1187
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
A quick one and he massaged their

1188
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Head and then they left

1189
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So I don't know why he didn't

1190
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I don't know why he didn't

1191
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Like give them the full service

1192
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You were with the sector keeper I guess

1193
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
That you know what now it makes a lot of

1194
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Sense I they probably also

1195
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Seemed like less engaged

1196
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
In what was going on

1197
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
There maybe what was happening around

1198
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I gotta say I was happy to see

1199
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
After we got out and we were like finishing up

1200
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
The woman

1201
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Working there went around and disinfected

1202
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
All the bits that we were in

1203
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I was happy to see that let me bring this

1204
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Up and this is I'm sure you

1205
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Probably noticed this sector keeper because I know

1206
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
You like you germs and stuff I know

1207
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Historically that you don't love germs

1208
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Correct

1209
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I didn't drown in the fountain

1210
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I died of a staph infection

1211
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh really? Geez oh no

1212
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So that's why

1213
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Your urine and blood got in your eyes

1214
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So that's why

1215
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Now I understand why the germs

1216
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But apparently they're in there for

1217
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Seven minutes and yet

1218
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So the gentleman today

1219
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Brought over other instruments

1220
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
That hadn't been used on me

1221
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yesterday oh and he

1222
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Started doing a thing where he would use

1223
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The same instrument on

1224
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
The sector keeper than me

1225
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So he would have like a look for lack of a

1226
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Better word a buzzy dildo kind of thing

1227
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And he'd come over and he'd like

1228
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Drive it into my back a little bit which by the way he did

1229
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Know what he was doing he could find he could feel

1230
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
What was happening he did a very good job then he would take

1231
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It and he'd go buzz the

1232
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Sector keepers back and I would be like

1233
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Mmm okay shouldn't you be using

1234
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Two different dildos for this

1235
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Skin to skin

1236
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah and then like the same with

1237
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
With the head thing too he would like

1238
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Put it on yeah your head and then my head

1239
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And I'd be like shouldn't we both have different head

1240
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Things again I wasn't worried

1241
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But like I guess he assumed we knew each other

1242
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And we were comfortable sharing

1243
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
A head massager

1244
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah you know each other's

1245
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Lice situation which hopefully

1246
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Is minimal. Hopefully we have a few

1247
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Lice in our hair. But if you end up in hell

1248
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You'll have nothing but lice

1249
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yes that's been one of the threats

1250
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That's one of the things that happens to you

1251
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's a bunch of millipedes running around

1252
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Your hair. Yes

1253
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Please please

1254
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
We'll try to save you from it I mean one way

1255
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That we could help you is by

1256
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Moving on to a loose clothing store

1257
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Boys I'm getting weak

1258
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I'm getting weak I need you to move on

1259
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh okay okay okay

1260
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Are you sure? Please

1261
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
If it pleases you we're also happy to keep talking

1262
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
About ZenZone for another hour

1263
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It is time to move on

1264
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
ZenZone has been an object of interest

1265
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Of all of ours for many years

1266
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's understandable why it would linger

1267
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
On it. I think we can

1268
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Let's through some of these others a little more quickly

1269
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't think every store will go through

1270
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
For as long but probably most

1271
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Probably most. I mean we

1272
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah when we were talking about doing this

1273
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I think we were like well you know some of the things

1274
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We're not going to be able to talk about a lot

1275
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We've hit the hour mark already on this episode

1276
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Ah very good

1277
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Let's keep talking about time

1278
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Let's talk about talking

1279
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Right or left?

1280
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Walk out of the store you're facing Ludo's chicken

1281
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I need you to go left to Billabong

1282
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Billabong

1283
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Billabong really is the first

1284
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Store if you're

1285
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
If you were leaving the park for the day

1286
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's the first one that you see

1287
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And it was a very

1288
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You know notable

1289
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Part of the city walk skyline

1290
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
In that the roof of the building is a big surf

1291
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Board. It's the big surf board

1292
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Fin and I remember at some point

1293
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
In time it was painted kind of like

1294
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Cowhide colors

1295
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So it was a big piece to let you know

1296
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This area you're going to enter is going to be

1297
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Crazy kooky

1298
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Sure and it's a little more

1299
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Tasteful in its color scheme now

1300
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And I went and poked around

1301
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This is something I want to bring up for future

1302
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Episodes I think we have to

1303
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
When it's a store that's in lots of different

1304
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Types of malls we have to talk about

1305
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Well how have they

1306
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
City walk a fight at? How have they stepped up

1307
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Their game on this major

1308
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Stage? Well that's an easy

1309
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Call for this one because there's a

1310
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Fucking wave pool right out front

1311
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Jason it's Jason it's

1312
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Jason it's gone

1313
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Jason I didn't even

1314
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Notice. It's gone the sector

1315
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Keeper said hey what about the water in front of Billabong

1316
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I think it's gone it's gone

1317
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
They got rid of it. The wave pool

1318
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
How did you not notice this yesterday?

1319
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I we were so. Sector keeper don't get angry

1320
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm going to leave

1321
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Okay you better not pull that

1322
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Shit every time something happens

1323
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I mean look

1324
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It was probably very

1325
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Wasteful during the drought during

1326
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
The year long drought. A boring

1327
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Answer but universal is all about

1328
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Wasting of water and blasting

1329
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It into your face and giving you massages

1330
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
With it. God. I want as much

1331
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Water wasted at universal as possible

1332
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And it was one of those things

1333
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Like I don't know why the first time you guys went to

1334
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
City walk but I grew up with it and it was

1335
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
My family and I would make a special

1336
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Trip every Christmas

1337
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
To go see city walk lit

1338
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Up at Christmas time

1339
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And it was

1340
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Like it was a pretty like

1341
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Special experience you know we'd go

1342
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We'd also pop into things if we went

1343
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
To universal studios but

1344
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You know city walk visits were a big deal

1345
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And I remember the first time walking through there

1346
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Thinking like well there's just like a little

1347
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Miniature beach thing

1348
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Like we stood and looked at it for a long time

1349
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I loved the wave pool. I remember the wave pool

1350
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah it was cool. It's now a ledge

1351
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Where tired parents sit

1352
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah they do need as much of that as

1353
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Possible universal. Makes sense

1354
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Real quick

1355
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
A billabong is an Australian

1356
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Term for a lake or pond

1357
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Left behind after a river

1358
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Changes course. Really?

1359
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Very common in Australia

1360
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I thought it was like a droga like not

1361
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Bong necessarily but it felt like a hipper

1362
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Kind of that's like a real formal

1363
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Sort of name

1364
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's a company that a surf company

1365
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
A surf style company that

1366
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Originated in Australia

1367
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Billabong mentioned

1368
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
In the Australian folk song Waltzing Matilda

1369
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You guys know Waltzing Matilda?

1370
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It is

1371
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's old enough for the Sectorkeeper to know it

1372
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah it's not in the 90's

1373
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I like it for Jason to know it too. My favorite song

1374
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It's about a swag man who

1375
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Can't buy a billabong. It's a song filled

1376
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
With like Australian

1377
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Terms and stuff

1378
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Can you sing us the part where billabong is said?

1379
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah

1380
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Down came a jump buck to drink

1381
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
At the billabong

1382
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Jumped the swag man and grabbed him with

1383
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Glee. He sang as he jumped

1384
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The jump buck in his talker bag

1385
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda

1386
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
With me

1387
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Wow

1388
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And then the chorus Waltzing Matilda

1389
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Waltzing Matilda

1390
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda

1391
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
With me. He sang as he shoved

1392
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That jump buck in his talker bag

1393
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You'll come a Waltzing Matilda

1394
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
With me

1395
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Jump buck is a male sheep. A talker bag

1396
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Is what like a traveling itinerant

1397
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Australian man

1398
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Carries

1399
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Scott is the sectorkeeper's

1400
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Thing

1401
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I feel weak too

1402
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I feel weak too

1403
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Anyway I know

1404
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Of billabong

1405
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I was never like a

1406
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Skate wear

1407
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Street surf wear

1408
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Kind of kid

1409
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I've always worn Vans a lot I guess

1410
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Or Tucker pants or whatever

1411
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
What would you wear when you went

1412
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Waltzing with Matilda

1413
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Like a puffy shirt

1414
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Like a peasant shirt

1415
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I was in school

1416
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
With Matilda

1417
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So you waltzed with her

1418
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes

1419
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But it stopped there because you're

1420
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
You're a gentleman

1421
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
A gentleman child

1422
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Billabong the shop is

1423
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Beautiful because it's always 1996

1424
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Inside

1425
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah it is

1426
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Gives you a vibe of like

1427
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Not like 90s pop punk

1428
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Even though that's not what they're going for

1429
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But that is what I associate with it

1430
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt

1431
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Jesus

1432
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
That's what I think

1433
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Of the 90s

1434
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The child ghost

1435
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Hey well I think it's

1436
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Time to keep moving on

1437
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
To

1438
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Fossil the watch store

1439
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Yes thank you thank you Scott

1440
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
What is Fossil doing at City Walk

1441
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Is my question

1442
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
That one of all of them is not even

1443
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
That's not elevated at all

1444
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
There was never a wave pool

1445
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Not a big surfboard

1446
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
There should be a giant watch

1447
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Bare minimum

1448
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I feel like it's gotten more Apple story

1449
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
As the years go on

1450
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I feel like Fossil stores I used to associate

1451
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
With a lot of inventory on the floor

1452
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And now it feels like

1453
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
There's barely anything on the shelves

1454
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
A quartz watch

1455
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah

1456
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And like high fashion

1457
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's trying to go more for high fashion

1458
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I guess that is what maybe City Walk

1459
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Is trying to now do in general

1460
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Because there's a Sephora there which is a little bit of a fancier store

1461
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
But like I think

1462
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
There should be like

1463
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Some made up clock store

1464
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Like Clockface's watch

1465
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Watch Emporium or something

1466
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
There's a Clockface man

1467
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
It's not fantastical enough

1468
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yeah and I think maybe that's probably unfortunately

1469
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
The way City Walk is going is they're probably going to start putting

1470
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Maybe more high end-y stuff like this in

1471
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Although this has been there

1472
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
For a while

1473
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I feel like it looks newer to me

1474
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah it's maybe gotten

1475
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Blender inside but yeah I agree

1476
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
We're just getting into it's just becoming

1477
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Kind of a standard mall

1478
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
As all malls are getting

1479
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You know you don't have the

1480
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
The mall I grew up next to

1481
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Had a food court called Chowzers

1482
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
With a Z and every

1483
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Store had a toothpick

1484
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
With like the little toothpick

1485
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Frilly

1486
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Confetti on the end of it

1487
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And like you know

1488
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
There's no reason to have that

1489
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You know production

1490
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Value and cartoon

1491
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Silliness but it made me love

1492
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Chowzers and remember it and talk about it on

1493
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
A podcast and the more City Walk

1494
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Gets bland the more it loses

1495
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Grounds to places like The Grove

1496
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And the Americana

1497
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah that's true yeah I mean if this was all

1498
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Just sort of a high end like

1499
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
You know Beverly Hills mall

1500
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
What's the point what is it City Walk anymore?

1501
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I mean I get the idea of people

1502
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Splurging when they're on vacation

1503
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But like Fossil is like a

1504
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That's a

1505
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's a real

1506
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Like that's a like a $200

1507
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Messenger bag

1508
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It's a lot of leather goods

1509
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's a lot of chunky watches

1510
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah

1511
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Has anyone here bought a Fossil watch ever?

1512
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
My sister did in the 90s

1513
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
With a

1514
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Heyday of Billabong? Yes

1515
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I hope you'll be reunited with her

1516
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
When this is all set up That would be lovely

1517
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I have a Fossil wallet

1518
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Someone gave me for Christmas

1519
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
A few years ago that I use every now

1520
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And then but I was

1521
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I'm not like really a leather guy or a watch

1522
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Guy

1523
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
The Fossil store

1524
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'm disappointed a lot of fans

1525
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Some people like

1526
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Leather

1527
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You're not a leather daddy?

1528
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I

1529
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We try to keep it a little cleaner

1530
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Here Sector Keeper

1531
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I try to keep my personal life off of this

1532
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm sorry Your child mind

1533
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Is more perverted than it should be

1534
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The Fossil store at

1535
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
City Walk Universal

1536
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
City Walk Hollywood

1537
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Not only lacks imagination

1538
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Michael and I noticed

1539
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It lacks watches

1540
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
There's a whole empty rack

1541
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That's supposed to be like watch like display

1542
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The very first rack

1543
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It is completely empty

1544
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
As if someone had

1545
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Stolen all of them

1546
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's like a kid just running by

1547
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Collecting them all on his arm

1548
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It's interesting because they're trying to

1549
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Compete too in like the smart watch

1550
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Category so they have

1551
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Giant facimiles of their

1552
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Smartwatches in the window

1553
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The Google powered smartwatches

1554
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
You can get a

1555
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Buckner NS City Bag

1556
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
For $118

1557
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You can get a Nasher

1558
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Backpack for $128

1559
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So it's not so bad

1560
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That's a little expensive for people

1561
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Let's demand the fans chip in

1562
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And buy Jason one of these bags

1563
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Get him a Buckner or get him a

1564
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Rory Courier Bag

1565
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Or if you want to go high end

1566
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
There's one called the Defender Portfolio

1567
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That I think would look nice

1568
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That looks sharp on Jason

1569
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Oh you know what never mind I take all that back

1570
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Get him the Estate Casual

1571
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Leather Backpack

1572
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Because he's a leather daddy

1573
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
From here on out

1574
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
You were too definitive that you weren't a leather daddy

1575
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Thus now you are

1576
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You didn't deny it buddy

1577
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Alright

1578
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh no

1579
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh growing weak

1580
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Boys

1581
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I think it's time to go

1582
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
To a city within a city

1583
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It's time for

1584
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Popcornopolis

1585
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm sorry we've left you hanging for so long

1586
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You know what all comedy

1587
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Podcasts should have

1588
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
A weak ghost to keep them on track

1589
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Boys, boys

1590
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Don't bring Bugsy back let him die the first time

1591
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So Popcornopolis

1592
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I did patron I went into

1593
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Popcornopolis and

1594
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I figured should sample some

1595
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Of the wares and bought a cone

1596
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Of churro corn

1597
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Tried a couple flavors

1598
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
You can get free samples

1599
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
They offer you free samples

1600
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Can I ask how

1601
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
My feeling on samples

1602
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Is that I will never ask

1603
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
For samples I only pick and

1604
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I eat I don't know what it is

1605
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I feel like I'm wasting their time

1606
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I know this is an unpopular opinion

1607
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I know you will get a sample of as many as they tell you

1608
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
They'll say limit three and you will get three

1609
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So you're being a

1610
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Sweets and treats boy

1611
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Is usurped

1612
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Overridden by you being a good boy

1613
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Yes I think that is sort of what I feel

1614
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I feel like well I haven't paid for this

1615
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So I feel bad even having a little ice cream

1616
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Or a little of the popcorn and also I feel like

1617
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Maybe from being raised by my mom

1618
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Telling me that I was not a picky

1619
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Eater that I go well I'll enjoy it

1620
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So like anything I order

1621
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I will like if I order ice cream if I order

1622
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
A meal I'm not I'll never see

1623
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
This is horrible like I'll just enjoy it

1624
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So you're a helpful trade

1625
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
In a theme park

1626
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I want to know what I'm getting into I only got two

1627
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Sample I sampled the Chicago style

1628
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Which is caramel corn and cheddar corn together

1629
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Which I liked fine but the sign outside

1630
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Add Truro corn and big

1631
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Letters I'm like oh I'm interested in that

1632
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I like a cinnamon like

1633
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I like cinnamon as a flavor

1634
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Or like roasted

1635
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Cinnamon nuts or

1636
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
In this case sweet cinnamon

1637
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Popcorn and it was really tasty

1638
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I thought it was good I had a little bit of it

1639
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I've had

1640
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I've had their popcorn before

1641
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Pretty good pretty good quality

1642
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Pretty good I do think it's very funny they call it

1643
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Gourmet popcorn like every

1644
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Now and then you see gourmet blank

1645
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Right I always wonder what does that really mean

1646
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
What does that really mean

1647
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I mean they have a lot of interesting they had a cupcake

1648
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Flavor of popcorn

1649
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yes they had a lot of I mean there was no way we could

1650
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Like they didn't know we were theme park

1651
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Journalists because I think they would have rolled out the red carpet for us

1652
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
If they shared and they would have had all the samples

1653
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Probably out like laid out and we would have been able to kind of come behind the counter

1654
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
They were willing to give samples though

1655
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Very willing to give samples and I said oh I like

1656
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'll take the Truro corn and

1657
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Just a small

1658
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I didn't want that much and they gave me

1659
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
A like

1660
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Foot long

1661
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Cone like it's a cone

1662
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It was a giant amount of popcorn yeah

1663
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I'm still it's it's

1664
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I shared it with you guys and with people

1665
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Afterwards and I still have

1666
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
A bunch left with the massage therapist

1667
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
With the massage therapist

1668
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
We should have gone into popcorn apples first and you could have

1669
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Eaten it while you were getting the massage

1670
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I feel like that would have been

1671
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Too distracting or we could have had someone feed it to you

1672
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Through the hole well now that sounds

1673
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Gourmet that someone had

1674
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Zenzone would have done it without being asked

1675
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm sure yeah if you had

1676
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Popcorn on the counter yeah they would have gone over

1677
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
All of a sudden you would have felt like it being shoved

1678
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Into your mouth popcorn apples lean

1679
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Sweet yeah I would

1680
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Say so yeah they have a lot of sweet

1681
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Flavors that the sprinkles

1682
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Yeah so there's not as zebra

1683
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah

1684
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I think my mom's a fan of zebra

1685
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
All gluten free I found out

1686
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
All varieties gluten free

1687
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Some of them kosher

1688
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
A handful of them are certified kosher

1689
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And they have other things there too they have

1690
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
A whole display case of candied

1691
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Apples that are like Disneyland style

1692
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Insane decorated with candy

1693
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Or confect sprinkles and stuff

1694
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You got something there you said

1695
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah so I said I should

1696
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You know I should experience something different than the popcorn

1697
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I got a

1698
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Frozen banana covered in chocolate

1699
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And sprinkles and

1700
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I forgot how big a banana can

1701
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Be because on the picture I

1702
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Thought oh a banana you know

1703
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Five inches skinny

1704
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Banana I thought

1705
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Okay this will be a nice quick little treat

1706
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It was not a tiny skinny

1707
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Banana I will show a photo of what it

1708
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Looks like and I'm in the picture

1709
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
For a size comparison

1710
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Big hard raging

1711
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Banana much bigger than that buzzy

1712
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Dildo that was used on mine

1713
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And the sector keeper's neck earlier

1714
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Here's how big it was

1715
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
You're making

1716
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
A face

1717
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I was like oh no

1718
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Why did I do this? The sector keeper directed

1719
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Michael to smile

1720
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Because he seemed

1721
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
He must be posted

1722
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Here's a picture now I'm happy

1723
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I can't zoom in but

1724
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Now I'm happy

1725
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It was very good

1726
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I mean I was not but I was just like oh no

1727
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
All the calories and it was a thick

1728
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Chocolate shell

1729
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
With sprinkles and it was good

1730
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Yeah it was very good

1731
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We don't do a ton

1732
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Of talking about restaurants

1733
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
On the podcast but with city walk

1734
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
We'll be going to a lot of restaurants

1735
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I feel like it would be helpful if we had some kind of

1736
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Like rating system to

1737
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Rank the food right

1738
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
If it was rated on a scale of

1739
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
1 to 4

1740
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Some sort of utensil or something

1741
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Would be good

1742
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
What if we rated it on the scale of

1743
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
1 to 4

1744
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Forchettas

1745
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
The Italian word for fork

1746
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Oh that's nice I love Italian

1747
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
First of all it's just one of the romantic languages

1748
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So I just think that and we're very like

1749
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
A romantic podcast so that makes a lot of sense

1750
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think this makes it an extremely

1751
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Original idea I think you're right

1752
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I mean I initially saw

1753
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
A lawyer some sort of podcast

1754
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Lawyer coming through

1755
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Like standing at the patio door

1756
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Here and then when he heard it was

1757
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
The word in Italian he like

1758
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You know tore something up and stopped

1759
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
His feet in anger

1760
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I can't get him now I was checking the

1761
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Italian translation so I missed

1762
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
All of that I'm so glad that this

1763
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is in the clear I'm not sure what he would have been

1764
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Mad about but this is

1765
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
This is a pretty original measure he's probably

1766
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
From hell

1767
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
He's trying to get me to come oh geez

1768
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay well we gotta keep him off your back and

1769
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Keep moving so if you guys had to wait

1770
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
What are the uno

1771
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Uno due tre

1772
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Quattro do they go up to

1773
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Do we go up to five

1774
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
No five would be insane cinque

1775
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
No cinque how would you

1776
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Rank your banana

1777
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Can you give me the numbers again? Uno due tre

1778
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Quattro I mean as far as

1779
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
What you're looking for I'll go

1780
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Quattro cause I mean look a nice frozen banana

1781
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Banana was a good quality

1782
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Is giant you get a lot for your money it's six bucks

1783
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
A little expensive but it's a giant thick

1784
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Hard banana and it was

1785
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Good it's thick chocolate and the sprinkles it very

1786
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Much the shell very much

1787
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Reminded me of my favorite

1788
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Dipped cones at Disneyland so you're getting

1789
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
That that's a solid treat

1790
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I've always liked it so yeah

1791
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'll go four I'd go quattro

1792
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
As well yeah

1793
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
The cone of popcorn was seven

1794
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And I honestly really didn't

1795
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Want that much but

1796
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You know I respect

1797
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
That you I think you are certainly getting

1798
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
A shareable quantity

1799
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Worth and you're getting a lot

1800
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Worth and I respect the business

1801
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Angle I know the margins are very good

1802
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
On like stuff like that popcorn that you

1803
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Can make on bulk and sell for a lot

1804
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
More than it sure actually costs

1805
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And again very friendly

1806
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Good service sure everywhere we went

1807
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
To up there and you guys want to put

1808
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Either the banana or the popcorn into

1809
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
The club the Targa

1810
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Dioro which

1811
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Translates to Golden Plate Club

1812
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
But whether we won't refer to it as that

1813
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Is coming back oh sure okay

1814
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
No club it's not in the club there is no club

1815
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And I guess we should

1816
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Keep moving to the final

1817
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Store in the sector yes

1818
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Boys boys keep moving please

1819
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You'll take a right out of popcorn

1820
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Opolis and you arrive

1821
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You'll arrive not in

1822
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Heaven but in a place

1823
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Called

1824
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Angel

1825
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But not spelled with all of the

1826
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Letters A N G L

1827
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
This is a shop that

1828
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Their website describes as California's

1829
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Hottest club dresses and

1830
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Trendy women's clothes

1831
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And that

1832
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Seem with what we know about women's clothing

1833
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Does it would you think it was

1834
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Trendy next to nothing

1835
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah I mean I would say

1836
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
So I really only peeked in it

1837
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
A little and I looked at their website

1838
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But from what I know

1839
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Of the price points of

1840
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Casual women's clothes

1841
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Or evening wear that sort of thing it seems

1842
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Reasonably affordable

1843
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Price on a leather

1844
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Dress a leather

1845
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Dress oh I see

1846
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Where you're going with that

1847
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You're getting my ass

1848
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I see what you're doing there

1849
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You wouldn't know that

1850
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
You're a leather daddy yeah yeah

1851
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I went in with a frozen

1852
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Banana I was eating it in

1853
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Angel today and I felt uncomfortable because Angel

1854
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
A lot of honestly

1855
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
A lot of clothes I have a lot of opinions on clothes

1856
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I thought a lot of the clothes looked nice I liked

1857
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
A lot of the designs

1858
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But it's so close in there all the things

1859
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Like fossils very spread out because it's watches

1860
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It doesn't take up much space

1861
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Angel was very claustrophobic

1862
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I felt as a store they crammed

1863
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
A lot of stuff in so I'll be honest

1864
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
We didn't get the full experience because I felt uncomfortable

1865
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Wielding chocolate covered banana

1866
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
In there that I would just like let

1867
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Some sprinkles fly and they would hit some women's clothing

1868
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Next to like summery crop tops and maxi

1869
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Dresses and that's what I said yes I didn't want to

1870
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Ruin the maxi dresses but it seemed very

1871
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Eclectic

1872
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Lots of options right I mean

1873
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Maybe they could

1874
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Have more of a specific style

1875
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
If I was critiquing Angel

1876
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Sure sure

1877
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
If you call something California it can be

1878
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Anything

1879
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
California is a catch all

1880
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Avocado could be swiss cheese

1881
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
You know is the California on a menu

1882
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
It's a loose genre isn't it

1883
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Well this is I'm kind of disappointed

1884
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
That Angel

1885
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Is the use of that location now

1886
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Because when City Walk opened

1887
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
This was one of the

1888
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Landmarks City Walk stores

1889
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It was called the Nature Company

1890
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And the Nature Company

1891
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Or from their own website

1892
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
At the time the Nature Company store

1893
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Features a rainforest exhibit with a replica

1894
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Of a banyan tree

1895
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Wow and if you were anybody

1896
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
We've talked about that Warner Brothers studio store a little bit

1897
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Where you'd walk into a little spaceship

1898
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Or some or a little movie studio or whatever

1899
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It was if you're a kid who's

1900
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Bored in a mall if they're like a thing you can

1901
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Go into like that little

1902
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Imaginarium door

1903
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
That stuff's always great and this thing

1904
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Yeah you've got to walk through a little

1905
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Rainforest which is very

1906
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Cool and very well done and the big thing

1907
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That I remember about this

1908
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I've been withholding this fact from you guys

1909
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
In my recollection

1910
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
This was the second location

1911
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
On the Universal Studios property with

1912
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
The E.T. Ride smell

1913
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Really? Oh sure

1914
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It had that same like that magical

1915
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Fake pine

1916
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Combining with that heavily

1917
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Chlorinated water

1918
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah that

1919
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That magical effect

1920
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
That was only on the E.T. Ride was also

1921
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
In this other place so I was really happy

1922
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
There was another little zone where you got a

1923
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Quick little hit of that

1924
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And you always recognized that like from

1925
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
The first time you went in did you oh it's the E.T. smell

1926
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Like did you immediately it's so

1927
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
No one told you oh that's the same smell

1928
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It wasn't like a

1929
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It wasn't a thing it was there was no

1930
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
You know Twitter accounts

1931
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Devoted to the E.T. smell or a message

1932
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Report talking about it right I remember like

1933
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
When I started when I first started talking to people

1934
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Who were also grew up around here and were fond

1935
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Of Universal that E.T. smell would come

1936
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Up so frequently and

1937
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I don't think I was the only one

1938
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Let me ask this question because you worked at the park

1939
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Did you ever see

1940
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
The canisters of smells?

1941
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
No no

1942
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
As I'll get into

1943
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
At some point I did get to see you know

1944
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Rotting botanica so I mentioned that

1945
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
On the first episode

1946
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I'll bring that up again later but the

1947
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
But I and one time after

1948
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
The Back to the Future I closed I got to see a big

1949
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Like a stack of lots of

1950
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
The DeLorean

1951
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Cars like they were they were all

1952
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Piled up in a junkyard way which

1953
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Was kind of depressing to see

1954
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And I went up there I snuck up there

1955
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
To see if there was any like little piece I could break

1956
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Off like a license plate or a

1957
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Flux capacitor or something

1958
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
But it wasn't really it was all like the

1959
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Big blunt pieces of it

1960
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So no no smell canister I never got

1961
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Any insight as to where the smell

1962
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Came from but I did get to experience

1963
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
That King Kong banana breath on the daily

1964
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Of course well another one of the great

1965
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Universal smells that would have been a

1966
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Crazy score though if you could have like

1967
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Stolen a canister of theme park smell

1968
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And then like

1969
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Just like when you were feeling the mood

1970
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
You go over and you like open the valve a

1971
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Little bit and take a big whiff

1972
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Now that's aromatherapy

1973
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I should use that at Zenzone

1974
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Oh boy what a good plus it up

1975
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Sector keeper

1976
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
It really is yeah if they want to cater

1977
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
To the locals and the people with

1978
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
With universal nostalgia

1979
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So like Dennis Hopper's character

1980
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
In blue velvet but instead of laughing

1981
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Gas you're taking a smell

1982
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Of that like

1983
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Kind of mildewy water

1984
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
In plastic

1985
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Or a bromide smell

1986
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Of theme parks

1987
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Now I feel like I'm in the

1988
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Forest outside of

1989
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
The Tongo

1990
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
The inexplicable pine forest

1991
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'm in Maggie Simpson's mouth

1992
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Baby powder

1993
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Smelling Shrek's farts

1994
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Those sort of like

1995
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Nature stores or

1996
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Discovery channel stores

1997
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Which eventually bought the nature

1998
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Company

1999
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
That you know they all sold

2000
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
A lot of educational toys

2001
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And rain sticks and that sort of thing

2002
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I was always interested in that because even as a kid

2003
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I was like how does this place make money

2004
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Like they were

2005
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Always at the most expensive malls

2006
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And you can play with everything

2007
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
You could buy it was out of

2008
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Box already yeah and

2009
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It's you know it's parents walking around

2010
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
With their kids going like is this the souvenir

2011
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You want for the trip is this your one souvenir

2012
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And all the kids

2013
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You just go like nah I think

2014
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I'm done I think I'm good

2015
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
By the time you've already

2016
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Played with it and had time to

2017
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Decide you don't want it you probably

2018
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Dig your hand into that pile of gems

2019
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Oh my god this is great I'll stick my

2020
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Hand in this all the time to relax

2021
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Me five seconds past

2022
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
You know what never mind I will leave with no gems

2023
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah they didn't

2024
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Didn't stick the line I guess there's nowhere to buy

2025
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Gems anymore I don't know where you go

2026
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
In Los Angeles in general if you want a rain stick

2027
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Yeah that's a good question

2028
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
If you guys know of a good

2029
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Other listeners if you know a good rain stick place

2030
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Let us know

2031
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Where would you go?

2032
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I thought you were gonna have

2033
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I didn't have anything

2034
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
What is Los Angeles?

2035
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Oh boy that's

2036
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Too much you're within

2037
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
You're up on high on the hill

2038
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Universal city

2039
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
That's how little Los Angeles

2040
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Affected you

2041
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Why would you need to know about Los Angeles?

2042
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Why do any of us if we could only be in

2043
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
CityWalk?

2044
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
We would maybe like to just trade places

2045
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
With you I guess?

2046
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I could arrange that

2047
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So if my spirit was freed yours would be

2048
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Incarcerated

2049
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Maybe would we be willing to trade?

2050
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
But would we get to be in CityWalk?

2051
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
You're not in city well you can go visit

2052
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
As you did because you went to the Zen Zone

2053
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yes yes no I can stay within the bounds of it

2054
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Oh okay

2055
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You're kind of in this limbo between death and life

2056
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And you have to stay within CityWalk

2057
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And only eat CityWalk food

2058
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yes correct

2059
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That's already where we're kind of heading

2060
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That's essentially the jail we've put ourselves in

2061
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
For the next 19 days and our listeners

2062
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And in fact we're heading there

2063
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Right from this recording

2064
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Not to tip

2065
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
We are going to be at CityWalk a lot

2066
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
In the next 19 days

2067
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yeah we are

2068
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
We sure are

2069
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Part of it is I think maybe we'll be frustrated

2070
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
But part of me thinks maybe by day 19

2071
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
We're fucking energetic

2072
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And we're like riding like a cocaine high

2073
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Of CityWalk like we may not like

2074
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Limb to the finish we may dead sprint

2075
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
To the finish of the series

2076
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
We may evolve to another plane of existence

2077
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Yeah well I'll say this

2078
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I'm afraid of where

2079
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
This is going and where my

2080
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Stamina will be by the end of it

2081
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
However at the moment

2082
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I feel very optimistic

2083
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And I want to just like

2084
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Commemorate that optimism with a little

2085
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Audio presentation

2086
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
For this the first part of the 19

2087
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Part series

2088
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Mike if I could ask you to hold this up

2089
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Hold my phone up to the microphone

2090
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And press play

2091
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And I will begin this little opening day

2092
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Audio presentation

2093
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
CityWalk this way

2094
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
CityWalk this way

2095
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
CityWalk this way

2096
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
CityWalk this way

2097
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Just give me some PINGS!

2098
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Ah, that was fun

2099
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
That represents my frame of mind right now

2100
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I hope my musical offerings

2101
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Were to your liking SectorKeeper

2102
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It was wonderful

2103
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It gave me strength

2104
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So much strength that

2105
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I feel like boys

2106
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Sector1 is complete

2107
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
We did it!

2108
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Hooray! So wait

2109
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
The stone! Yes yes Sector1's

2110
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Stone is now yours

2111
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Wow, there it is

2112
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It just appeared

2113
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I'll pick it up

2114
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Can you like spray that down

2115
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Like the ZenZone people just sanitize

2116
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Before we touch it

2117
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Okay

2118
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Before it goes skin to skin I'll take it

2119
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's as if

2120
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
It's as magical as holding up

2121
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
To 40 nature company gems

2122
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yes

2123
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
We're all the flavors of popcornopolis

2124
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
At once

2125
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
SectorKeeper you will be

2126
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Not

2127
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You will be checking in throughout our journey

2128
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I will be your guardian as you

2129
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Venture into each of the sectors

2130
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And we have some fellow travelers

2131
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Who will be joining us

2132
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Oh yes indeed

2133
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Some new favorites

2134
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Some new guests who inexplicably

2135
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Are starting

2136
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Doing a first episode

2137
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000

2138
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Good luck to them

2139
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The journey is long and hard

2140
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
But fruitful

2141
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
May I leave you with some words of wisdom

2142
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Of course

2143
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
As you walk through the city walk

2144
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Remember, it is a place of commerce

2145
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It is a place of fun

2146
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And it is a place of food

2147
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Always, boys always

2148
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Yes

2149
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Go Raiders

2150
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Go Raiders indeed

2151
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Thank you for this motto

2152
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Thanks for checking out this episode

2153
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And we're serious

2154
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Check in for the next 18 days

2155
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yes

2156
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
In a row

2157
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
There will be a new episode

2158
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Maybe not all this long

2159
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Although you know us

2160
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Could be

2161
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
On Twitter, on Instagram

2162
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Facebook

2163
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Is this Facebook group happening?

2164
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Sectorkeeper, anything you'd like to plug?

2165
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I just would like to maybe reiterate

2166
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
The more people that follow you

2167
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Rate and subscribe

2168
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
The less likely it is that my soul is in hell

2169
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Oh great

2170
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Each follower gives you wings

2171
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Like tiny ones

2172
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Not like a full set

2173
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
But by the time you've got like a thousand of them

2174
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
There's an aggregate of wings that can

2175
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Kind of send your spirits

2176
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So now it's up to you listeners

2177
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Help save a ghost life?

2178
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
For as the British S.A.S. say

2179
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Who dares wins

2180
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
See you tomorrow

2181
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
See you tomorrow

2182
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Forever

2183
