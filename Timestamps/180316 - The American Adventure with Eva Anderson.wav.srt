00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Warning! Today's episode may include Kafka-esque theatrical kidnappings, robots who paint in blood, and cannonballs that don't pay no mind. Eva Anderson helps us spread our golden wings and fly to the American adventure on today's Podcast The Ride.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello and welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast hosted by three men who would rather enter the basketball court inside the Matterhorn than Christ's kingdom of heaven.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a long walk. I'm Scott Gairdner and I'm joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have thought about how cool it would be to play basketball in there, and I don't. I'm a bad athlete, I'm bad at basketball, but...

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I bet everyone who has played in that is terrible. I bet it's a land for non-athletes. Except for those Matterhorn mountain climbers. They're athletic.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, they're very athletic. So yeah, anyway.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You know, if we don't acknowledge the other host, then does he get to talk?

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, good point. We could cut him out, we could ice him out.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Does he really have the power? No, he will. Hey, we gotta get him in on this. It's Jason Sheridan.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hi, this is my greatest fear, when everyone just turns on me.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I knew it was coming, I've prepared for it, I've spent a lot of time thinking about it.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You have your own, like, theme park podcast logo made up for when you split off because we've iced you out?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, when you go to just Jason's theme time. Jason's theme park.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Jason's theme time. So I guess it's just me now.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, that's my intro every episode. It's very off-putting and people hate it.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Also the name of your album, your first musical album. It's just me now.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's just me now.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Just you glum in a sweater.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, the cover is, yeah. Well, the back cover is me in a sweater, the front cover is me in a tuxedo, but the bowtie's undone.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Cigarette. I'm sort of like a Seth MacFarlane type.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But at the end of the night, the show didn't go well, everyone walked out.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah. All right, and there is a fourth joining us. We're very happy to have her. A great writer and performer from Comedy Bang Bang and You're the Worst. It's Eva Anderson.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey, guys.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hey.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you so much for being here. We're so excited to have you.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so excited to be here.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, man. There's so much to talk about. I feel like I've heard rumors of your theme park lore and backstory, and you seem in general like just a big fan of insane experiences out in the world.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As are we, so yeah.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But you're braver about them than we are. You'll do some interesting stuff, scary stuff, immersive stuff where it seems like you're getting abducted or there's a prowler at the door.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I had a, like two years ago, I bought a subscription service where this immersive theater company did a play in my life, and they came to my house at six in the morning and arrested me in a Kafka-esque fashion.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wow. Oh, my God.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They were all young people who lived in Orange County.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So aware of the not characters you were dealing with.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They brought you into a van and took you somewhere?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, they showed up at my house, and they were like, you were under arrest for crimes. And it was fucking incredible.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then they sent me to my room to change into my finest to meet the inspector.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I did. And while I was in my room, they hid things all over my house that I had to find later.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I feel like one of your roommates told me, like, yeah, every now and then a strange box will show up.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, Lisa.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, Lisa will just be like, yeah, there'll be a strange box every now and then, and we just assume it's an Eva thing.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You also prepare to meet the inspector. Fuck no.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No, no, I have to go to work.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I know. So I did that for a while. And then that theater company moved to San Francisco without ever finishing my story.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, no, they might be back, though.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This might be the it's a long con kind of thing.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah. What is it?

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It is too long.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You don't think this is the prestige is not coming, right?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's the end of a magic.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What if they had figured out what if we revealed to you that we were part of this and that this is the finishing part of the group from La Mirada.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, we're from La Mirada.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And we started this podcast as a way to con you into getting here.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And now we're revealing the finale.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, my God. Immersive actress Dolores Quintana walks out in the hallway.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hi.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Dolores, not yet. We just mentioned you. Get back.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Dolores is an old friend of Jason's.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, my God.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What if you guys pretended to be interested in theme parks week after week?

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hoping that I would listen to the podcast.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
To lure me in.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
All right. Step one. She's in.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Very predictable. We learned everything.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, man.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OK. Yeah. So all right. So you've there. Yeah. You've been involved in immersive theater world.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You also you grew up getting to experience some like the kinds of Disney experiences that will still today make us insanely jealous.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I feel like I mean, you know, prepared to hear some some very genuine gasps, I suppose.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm not trying to I'm aware of my privilege. I want to say that up top.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right. Like I know that this is not normal and that it's by talking about it, it might be like annoying.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know. You're you. Well, if you're if you're appreciative.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, yes. Highly.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah. It's all in the attitude. If you're saying like, yeah, of course, I got to do these cool things, then then people will be mad.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But if you're saying I'm so humbled by the experience to have done, you know, like whatever you're about to say, you know, I think people would be like generally happy for you that you got to do it.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, I don't need people to be happy. Oh, OK. Never mind. I don't want to be mad.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, yeah. I don't want to be. Got it. Got it.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It would be insane that that is someone that is what made someone bad.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Aren't you happy for me? I demand that you're happy for listeners.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please be happy for you.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, yeah, I'm look, I'm not sure how to get into it. I just I know like you guys like it's it's all like a hushed secret.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Like I heard that Eva went to the. Yeah, we I guess you would mention to me and Scott, like some of the things you got to do.

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, I guess we should first say you have a family connection.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah. So my dad is Harry Anderson, who was on Night Court and Cheers, and he worked for Disney through the in the 80s and 90s.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
OK, on and off. He was the absent minded professor in the new version of it on TV in 88.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then there was like a sequel, I think probably in 89 or 90, which you reminded me of.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And he is like he has like a like a computer assistant. Yeah, there's a trailer.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you Google it, it's fucking great. He has like a computer friend named Albert who talks.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He's on like the screen of a tiny, tiny Apple computer, like a grayscale, a grayscale animated like Albert Einstein character.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who's like, yes, you should call it flubber.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's just very available. Just Google away.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I like that he the computer, the professor doesn't get to figure out that it's flubber.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A computer has to word analyze and figure it out for.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, I see flubber. He got the idea from a computer saying the idea.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right. OK, OK. And what like what else in Disney World?

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I feel like I do remember him from like from a lot of like specials.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He hosted a lot of or like appeared in a lot of specials, I think.

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Sure. OK. Which I should say, I don't think I've talked to you about this,

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that the specific special that he hosted, the Disneyland story is my very favorite one that ever I am.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am an aficionado of like at this point, dozens and dozens of Disney specials of various kinds.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And this was the one that I taped off the TV, wore it out.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like I remember every commercial brand. I remember the specific like Sizzlers commercials.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know at all what it's about.

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't know. I was hoping this would be the case.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's very complicated. Mike and I have also watched it, but I watched it.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We're not nearly as deep as Scott is on this.

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I specifically love the last 10 minutes.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But Scott, I'll let you build to that. The last minutes are very specific.

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Here I have it in front of me and I can flip through. I'm very excited to get to explain this to you for the first time.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm very excited to see it. We open on the Disneyland railroad station and your father.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, he's in a fedora and trench coat.

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I feel like he had kind of like an old timey air and a lot of things.

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, that was his look. Sure, sure.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So he is in the back of a train and it's like a special car and a special train that is going to like not just do the regular route.

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But instead take you through the history of Disneyland and through time.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The thing I don't want to put on Mike here so I can just keep talking is that this is all set to the Back to the Future music.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Not Disney property. Not Disney property.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I was so messed up and I love this thing so much that in my mind it was always it.

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, like when I saw Back to the Future, I was like, oh, it's the Disneyland story music.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is in something else. That's how backwards. I love this special so much.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I love that. And then I'm very excited you get to see this for the first time.

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Here's your dad traveling through time through the history of Disneyland and like the time train at the end of Back to the Future 3 sparkles.

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Old analog sparkles. Yeah, like lighting up the room.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Maybe some glow purple. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like neon. Oh, it's like he's going to die.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like still lightning bolts. It's like aha Take on Me level technology.

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He passed a calendar that said February.

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
A tunnel that took him through the space with the Star Tours warp.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And now he is in awe of the history of Disneyland.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There's Maleficent. He just passed Walt.

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There's a lot of just mouthing wow. He's just pointing.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, yeah. He's doing good.

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is it's so much fun. Just look this up on YouTube. Enjoy it on your own time.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh yeah, I will. And show your father's work.

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Now the thing for me that where this special really takes gets me is the last like 10 minutes.

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's like here's what's coming soon to Disneyland.

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And it is all these attractions and most of them never happened.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What are they? Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers.

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, you guys have mentioned that. The shooting game?

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The shooting game. Yeah, where you would shoot criminals in a police car.

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh man. We were such a Dick Tracy family that would have been so dope.

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh man. I think it would really stand out today the way that.

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, another thing that they talked about was like more.

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You ended up with Toontown and you ended up with the Roger Rabbit cartoon spin ride.

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I think there would have been a ton more. Like an entire Roger Rabbit world.

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh wow. And Roger Rabbit and Dick Tracy were both very odd because they didn't like.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They didn't maintain. Like their standing in Disney culture.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No. So it dropped off right after this special basically.

152
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But it's so crazy because Roger Rabbit I would argue is like one of the best.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was a huge hit. It's like E.T. where there was no. Because there are no further films.

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well there's kind of less of a way to keep it alive.

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The Roger Rabbit last little because they had like they would did a short with the baby.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah. So like their baby Herman. And then the ride is Disneyland.

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh yeah. You're like a baby Herman's carriage. Yes.

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That gets out of control. So Roger floated along for a while.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There's been rumors. There was a rumor for a long time that they were going to remake an old Hope and Crosby movie with Mickey and Roger.

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Which is a great idea. That didn't happen.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think there was there was going to be like a great movie ride out here or more Hollywood themed stuff that never got built.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Well alien encounter out here. It's just like one by one he takes you into the future and goes up to the year 2000 and lists many many things none of which I think not a single one in the list.

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And you wonder Disney does a lot of that like kind of preannouncing plans even in specials which I wonder if that's partially to generate interest in it and like gauge fan interest in.

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well now it's only like if the money is ready. Now it's only like if something is going to happen.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But they also suppose the rumors are that they gauge interest now on podcasts. They leak information to podcasters.

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I won't say who but they'll leak information out and then they'll get a like a test from the audience to see if people online are mad or not.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And then they proceed with or they pull the plans back.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Such as it was recently announced that the Disney Hollywood Studios was maybe going to be called Disney Cinemagine Park which is a bizarre horrible name.

170
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't like that at all.

171
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But it was but they said no it's not happening but there was a whole rumor leak about it and then all of a sudden people must have been like irate like we all just were.

172
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's how we are show up being irate. Oh no that's bad.

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then they said no we're going to we're going to keep the name Hollywood Studios.

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So let's keep being vocal about everything to see if it affects. I'm going to show you one more part of this special.

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So he is talking about we're in the haunted mansion era of Disneyland history and the Imagineers are gauging whether it will be a funny ride or a scary ride.

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And then there's this.

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In the end the mansion becomes more light than fright. Kind of a happy haunting ground for the whole family.

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Good. Now I can go there with my five year old. Otherwise she'd have to go alone.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, I was five.

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay. I wasn't sure if there was a sibling if there's a little brother.

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, but that's it. Oh, that's so cool.

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There you go. You're joking this. But this thing that I watched religiously when I was like five months ago.

183
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So sweet. Yeah.

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I love that. So yeah. Big fan of that. It's very exciting to show you that.

185
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't wait to watch it later and see all the things that he talks about that never happened.

186
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. That part is really fun. In general it's like a really it's a fun little like jaunt through Disneyland history that kind of spells it out for a kid.

187
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But that sets you up to then go on every website known to man and discover every specific date everything opened and who designed it all.

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And this started me on the road to ruin.

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It seems like it had a decent budget. Like some of these specials we have watched or talked about like have been pretty slapdash.

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And this one is the opposite.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If they in fact paid for the Back to the Future.

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Unless it's sound alike enough and we just are filling in the blank.

194
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Just assuming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. It's literally.

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

196
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah. Sort of odd culture clash.

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So your first visit to Disneyland was it just as a normal civilian or was it a.

198
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah. Okay.

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And also my I think my first visit to well maybe now this is five year old because my mom told me the first time.

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So we I grew up in L.A. I went there when I was little.

201
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We went I just rode Dumbo or whatever.

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Sure.

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There was like a family lore which I don't know if it's true.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And my because I love my dad but he can be a bit of a fabulous.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I think I know that word. You know fabulous. Okay.

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Sure. Flights of fancy. I see. Yes.

207
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He claims that in high school he worked at Disneyland and he was in the goofy suit and he got fired for being on acid on Tom Sawyer's Island in the suit hiding behind a tree.

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And so scandalous information. I know. You listen to the show you know what that does to us.

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But also that might not be true. Okay.

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So a fun story he likes to tell. Right. Because he was and also he was underage for like the job or maybe he wasn't.

211
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think he was underage for he lied about his age.

212
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So yeah because my dad grew up here he went to North Hollywood High nearby.

213
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay. Yeah. And then he lived in Orange County and worked at all the parks.

214
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He worked at Japanese Deer Garden. Have you guys learned about that.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Is it a Buena Park thing. Yeah.

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It was like an animal park that briefly existed by Knott's Berry Farm I guess.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is it. I've seen photos of some weird attraction where there's like people in mascot costumes of Japanese people.

218
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes. And that is horrible. That's it. That's the Japanese Deer Garden.

219
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay. Deer Garden?

220
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah. It had been miniature I guess miniature Japanese deer.

221
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I one time found because he worked there too and there's another story about that.

222
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He got bit by a Black Widow spider.

223
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh God.

224
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Maybe it was his friend. I don't know.

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But anyway I was in Chinatown once and I found a like memorial plate from this this attract this park.

226
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So it did exist. Okay.

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And it's I don't think it was very short-lived. I think I researched a little bit and it was like a yeah it had a bear that would do tricks and I had like yeah it was just like a Japanese themed animal park.

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wow. Weird. Yeah. Sixties.

229
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I worked at a lot of oddities. For sure. Like the wax museum that's kind of been nothing for a long time.

230
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is there nothing in there? I drove past it because I you guys know I because I tweeted at you that I did what you said Scott.

231
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh yeah.

232
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I was driving up from Orange County from San Diego where I was buying actually a piece of art by a Disney watercolor.

233
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay. Yeah. I based on your on the podcast.

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh man.

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'd been researching because of the Van Leeuwen. Is that the Van Leeuwen?

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Van Een Gallery.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Van Een Gallery.

238
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I was researching as I was buying a gift for my boyfriend I was researching different fine art by like Disney by watercolor California watercolorist.

239
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay.

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And it turns out that I didn't know this history but in the 40s and 50s Walt bought basically bought his own watercolor school.

241
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So because he wanted to like have a bunch of watercolorists at the go for all of the collectives paint all the backgrounds and be animators.

242
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And like have people ready to go like as and especially as these like moving people to the parks or whatever else.

243
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

244
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like have like people ready to fill the town halls I guess.

245
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So he invested a ton of money in this watercolor school.

246
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So if you were like a watercolor artist from anywhere in the country you end up in California going to the school which then merged and became CalArts.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
CalArts right.

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Which still feeds the system.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh.

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah.

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Wow.

252
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So anyway I bought.

253
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Wait so it was there or like like was it literally that campus in Valencia or whatever or.

254
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't know where the original I think might have been Pasadena.

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Weird.

256
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But yeah.

257
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So I bought a painting by a guy named Art Riley who did a bunch of like seascapes but he also painted backgrounds for Bambi and a bunch of other like yeah the original movies.

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So cool.

259
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Those people are no joke.

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Those original artists are so great.

261
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's cool and it's a if you Google the guy Art Riley it's a seascape but it looks like a Disney background.

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's really cool.

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh cool.

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh amazing.

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So I was driving up from there and I was like there's traffic and I was by Knott's Berry Farm and I was like I could just according to the podcast not go in but just hang out near and see what's around.

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
For free.

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Parking free.

268
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I mean you got to buy the food and the drinks and everything but how did it go?

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How was your how was your time?

270
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It was fun.

271
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I walked around I went in all the little shops.

272
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I had some soup which was not good.

273
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And a and a boysenberry beer.

274
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh yeah.

275
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Which you were iffy on.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A little sweet but also it's nice that the chicken restaurants expanded enough that there's like other you didn't have to wait at all.

277
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I just went in.

278
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah there's a ton of rooms and yeah if you go at an odd time I think that's a that's a legit bar.

279
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think it's very nice in there.

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't think I think they didn't they they retained the like old timey charm I feel.

281
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I still haven't been to the new renovated.

282
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
OK.

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

284
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know it was like it kind of looked like it was maybe not a good time a good type of chintzy was maybe like a little retirement home.

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah I made you feel old.

286
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But that was how the old like the old Mrs. Knotts chicken restaurant was like had not been renovated in like 60 years.

287
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

288
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So that's always that's part of the charm is that it was kind of a dump.

289
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah but the one time I ate there there was like a really really old angry woman at the table next to me just like senile and bitter there with her family and didn't seem to be having fun.

290
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I was like well no wonder you're in like the nursing home dining room.

291
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh yes.

292
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's exactly how it fit.

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah yeah yeah and sort of like spare and like old surfaces that you never see that are very 60s and when I went well you were there for that that brunch right?

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes we went to a breakfast brunch or yeah breakfast like buffet.

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Andrew Grissom.

296
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And there was the biggest piece of meat I had ever seen.

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What was it was a ham or something.

298
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

299
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It was just a ham and it would look like it was I'm trying to think of it like a suitcase size of it was just like rotating there and it just I don't think I don't think any of us ate any of it.

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was just it was filet.

301
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It was a dead Snoopy.

302
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I mean it was bigger than Snoopy.

303
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I think it was like Charlie Brown's mom or something.

304
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It was bigger than it was crazy.

305
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So yeah.

306
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And you were scouting the hotel.

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I didn't walk in.

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I just looked it's so gross.

309
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It was like so dirty and gross from the outside.

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah yeah and there's like kind of an odd like there's like a there's a wedding area with a gazebo but then it's just it's not like a little manicured garden.

311
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's just sort of pavement.

312
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh no.

313
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah amber amber waves the restaurant.

314
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I can see the sign for amber waves.

315
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh you know I have no complaints about amber waves.

316
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I had a good I had a good drink in the amber waves.

317
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We had a good drink up amber waves.

318
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The Friday.

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Did you go to the Friday the TGI Friday.

320
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I marveled at it.

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah yeah.

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's all you need to do.

323
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Behind the candy store like indoors where the bathrooms are there's like a weird mill installation that Walter not put there with like a plaque being like yes the mill wheel.

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes it's weird.

325
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's a little room right.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah yeah it's a room with like weird foliage leading to the bathrooms and then this is it's hot right.

327
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's like humid.

328
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's very humid in there.

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah it feels like you're probably to keep the plants nice.

330
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It feels like you're in like at the county fair like one of the horticultural pavilions.

331
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
When I was on sheds at the fair location that stays there for like even when the fair is closed.

333
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The.

334
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah.

335
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And also George Washington's fireplace George Washington's mantle is there.

336
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Look it's I.

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You know I'll end up talking about it on many an episode.

338
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Going out and going to park.

339
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If we're talking about something being dumpy and chintzy that doesn't mean don't go there.

340
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah yeah.

341
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I was I had a great time.

342
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That means get in your car right now and go.

343
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But we should clarify this is not one of the the amazing privilege experiences Eva got.

344
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh yes.

345
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
A common Southern California thing.

346
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You do all the time.

347
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you if traffic is just so insanely bad as it often is sometimes you just hunker down at a bar or restaurant for a little while until it clears up.

348
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

349
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You don't have to be not very far.

350
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

351
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You don't have to be a captain of industry to go see George Washington's mantle.

352
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's an experience waiting for all of you.

353
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
One more thing I noticed while I was there right now they're doing a peanuts sort of peanuts experience at Knott's Berry Farm where you can meet all the characters from peanuts.

354
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And they aren't always doing they're always there but I think there's like a celebration you're talking about like peanuts.

355
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah.

356
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Special themed snacks around the park.

357
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And there's like a peanuts land in one area where you can meet and get pictures with Charlie Brown and and Linus and Snoopy and Lucy.

358
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But they if you go on the website you can find this pig pen is just in Old West Town in the livery barn.

359
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Separate from his friends.

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah he's in the fucking livery barn and they just say in the livery barn and he's just like standing there covered by like dirt and there's like clouds of dust around him like that are drawn.

361
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And you can get a picture with him but you have to know that he's in this other area and there's no I don't know how you would know that.

362
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's odd.

363
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah.

364
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You aren't reading the park literature.

365
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
In this barn we eat pig pen in a simulated filth.

367
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
He eats from a trough.

368
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's like where the freak show freaks have to stay on the road.

369
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Also not a thing like not a cliche about children that they're so filthy they never are clean.

370
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Like he's like the weirdest of all the I read I was googling I was reading the Wikipedia pig pen and I guess Charles Charles Schultz was embarrassed that he created pig pen because wow.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Ultimately he was like his least favorite character because he only had one game character game right.

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It made no sense.

373
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh oh yeah because what is his personality outside.

374
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And it was like he was so popular and he was like I wish I hadn't made this.

375
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
He was a dirty boy. Like this cursed dirty boy what hath I wrought.

376
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Everywhere I looked there's kids with flies around them going around them in perfect circles.

377
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah leaving lines visible lines behind them.

378
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I mean the subtext I don't think I'm making this or this isn't my original thought but he was a poor kid.

379
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Right.

380
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Like that's maybe the subject but eventually it became a thing where he would bathe and then the dust would appear immediately.

381
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Was the genetic condition that he was dirty.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah just more like some curse like a gypsy curse.

383
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

384
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Wow I didn't realize magic.

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So like Tim Allen Santa Claus when he would shave the beard it would come right back so like he would wipe the wash the dirt away.

386
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's really grim.

387
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
At one point he like keeps part of his body clean long enough to like woo a girl in one comic.

388
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is all in the Wicca sheet.

389
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
A struggle we can all relate to right.

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Anyway he's in the livery barn you can meet him.

391
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Check him out he's almost always there he's not part of the celebration that's just his cage.

392
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Jesus Christ.

393
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If he hasn't lost his spirit if he hasn't just like huddled in the corner maybe he'll come say hi.

394
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He's docile.

395
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay but so alright well we got onto it and someday we'll talk about the American Adventure.

396
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We'll get in there for you know the last 10 minutes or so.

397
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes.

398
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay so you're the rest of your Disneyland upbringing.

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay so so my dad was working for Disney so the craziest thing was that in I believe it was 89 or 90 we flew to Disney World and were there for the opening of MGM Studios.

400
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Because my dad did the I think he was the because his character was a judge he like marshaled the opening and he his handprints are in front of the Grawman's.

401
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh wow.

402
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah so that was insane we flew in like a weird plane with like Kevin Costner.

403
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh wow.

404
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And we're there for that and then after that we went four more times over the years to Orlando and we had like the crazy we had guides.

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Okay.

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So we had a vacation but we had like the guides that let you in the back and we never waited in line.

407
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh man.

408
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And so the things that were crazy that happened during that time was one is that in the lounge celebrity lounge waiting to go on Honey I Shrunk the audience.

409
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We met Roger Ebert with Chaz and the kids.

410
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He gave us all of the Oscar predictions that he had for the next week when Forrest Gump was up.

411
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
He did not think Tom Hanks would win.

412
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Wow.

413
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Peter Fonda would win for Uli's gold.

414
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But then after the movie was over he turned to us and gave it gave it a thumbs up.

415
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Wow.

416
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
For a he gave Honey I Shrunk the audience a thumbs up.

417
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

418
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Was he there to do were their cameras capturing that was he there to do that only.

419
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think he was on a vacation and like he we both got put in the same lounge.

420
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The thing about Disney World it's like if have you guys ever done a guide at Disneyland.

421
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Have you ever been in that position because it's like at Disneyland they were never built for to have special guests.

422
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So you just walk in the exit in front of everyone if you want if you're not good.

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Florida like actively built for VIP.

424
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah.

425
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's like special entrances special rooms that you hang out in and then like entrances where no one sees you get on the ride.

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So it's like this crazy like system.

427
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh I've heard I worked for this Disney owned company and like the CEO of it got to like was when it got on the Haunted Mansion and there's like a room of the Haunted Mansion and not just a waiting room but like a room with a painting gag that's only for VIP.

428
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Wow really.

429
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There's a separate start to the ride.

430
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't remember but I'm sure I saw that.

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's crazy.

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We've talked about on the show that those are the corporate there's corporate lounges at Epcot for these different companies.

433
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So I don't know if you got to go did you get to go in the corporate lounge or there different lounges.

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Well for a new one like Honey I Shrunk the Audience I think this was just like for VIPs.

435
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Right.

436
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But I bet I bet I went in the Exxon lounge.

437
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes that's what I'm asking if you got to go and hang with the Exxon employees.

438
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I definitely did.

439
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I definitely went on the Exxon ride and I definitely did a walk out when it broke.

440
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh yeah.

441
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Is that what it's called?

442
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh really?

443
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah I walked through the dinosaurs once which was great.

444
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Wow that's great.

445
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And then okay here's a couple other crazy things that happened.

446
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Road Tower of Terror with Alan Menken.

447
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Wow.

448
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
On the way out Alan Menken turns to us and says pretty good needs a song though.

449
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Oh wow.

450
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And Menken forecasting what would happen to the when the Guardians of the Galaxy ride would take over and they just added songs to it.

451
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So really he was 20 years ahead.

452
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But I think he was also being funny about how Twilight Zone has this very good song.

453
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I see.

454
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Oh yeah.

455
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And he was he was he was being like.

456
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh he was downplaying the yes the famous ride.

457
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah he was like I'm cool.

458
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And then the third crazy thing I did was I got to take a tour of the animation studios and see an automatic of Beauty and the Beast before it came out.

459
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It was crazy.

460
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Wow.

461
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So those are all very privileged experiences I had and I want you all to be happy for me.

462
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I swear I am.

463
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I swear.

464
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The the like the entire film Beauty and the Beast.

465
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No it was just a scene.

466
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It was the scene where where he the where he gets hurt after he gets hurt going into the woods to help her and then like he yells at her.

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And and it was like Robbie Benson and what's what Pedro Jara's voice is and just like drawings like and we just got to watch him in like a little screening room.

468
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Do you remember being confusing to watch because I feel like I've seen like Disney animatics or so like pencil scratch.

469
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But it was like interesting I mean and we also got to see like the very early CGI of the because I think the the chandelier was a very early computer animated effects.

470
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh right.

471
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So we got to see that too.

472
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Wow.

473
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And I got to walk around just kind of see like editors animators cubicles where they would have like funny little like inside jokes that they attacked on the outside but it was like they were such great artists that they all looked really amazing.

474
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So that was a great experience.

475
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Did any characters leap off the page and wink at you?

476
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It was like them drawing each other like unflatteringly.

477
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh wow.

478
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It was like that was what it was mostly.

479
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It was like oh someone had sketched like Rob and stuck it on his cubicle and he was like oh man.

480
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And but you know it was still like hand drawn I don't know how much hand drawn animation still happens there now.

481
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think there is no animation studio now.

482
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:56,000
They were still doing it up until I think like a lot of Mulan happened there's a movie like look we're plenty researched but there's I want to say Mulan or something is was done entirely at MGM Studios.

483
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I think that's right.

484
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah.

485
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But there's nothing there anymore really.

486
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
They closed that whole studio there in Florida.

487
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Isn't it weird that Orlando had to pretend to have a film industry for the sake of pumping up these parts?

488
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yes it is funny because Eisner wanted people not to go to Universal Studios.

489
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So that's why there was a back lot at Hollywood Studios.

490
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's so weird.

491
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But why did they ever film anything at Universal either?

492
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Like why just declare out for no reason Orlando is Hollywood East?

493
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Well I think they thought that people would be like okay if it's themed like a studio we'd better see some movies being shot here.

494
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Like no one cares.

495
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
When people don't give a shit.

496
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I just want to go on rides right?

497
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah I just want to go on rides.

498
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Like that was I was watching some video on YouTube and it pointed out that like yeah the back lot at Disney MGM Studios was next to an attraction called Catastrophe Canyon that was constantly exploding every 12 minutes.

499
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So not a great shooting environment in terms of like pristine audio quality.

500
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah.

501
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I have a couple very specific memories of places I haven't researched but I know they were there.

502
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Uh huh.

503
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
There was a restaurant where you would eat in a person's living room.

504
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Do you guys know what this is?

505
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Oh yeah the 50s primetime cafe.

506
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah and there would be a mean.

507
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This all leads up to like the reason I pay people to like come to my house and yell at me.

508
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Because my favorite thing about that was there was an actress who was mom and she would yell at everyone.

509
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And you are the cousins.

510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Like you are not the children.

511
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You're the cousin.

512
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Did you guys ever go to this?

513
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yes I did when I was little.

514
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Is it still around?

515
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh yeah.

516
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah it is.

517
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Is it the same deal?

518
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah it is.

519
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Same deal.

520
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We didn't go last time.

521
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You walk in the bar is themed after dad's study.

522
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So you can just sit and have a drink in dad's study in the bar.

523
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's so cool.

524
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No one is mean to you there.

525
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's because it's dad's study.

526
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
His dad is drunk.

527
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But then when you sit down like you know they come out.

528
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Mom comes out and gets you.

529
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And you eat like meatloaf and shit.

530
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And you eat meatloaf and fried chicken and mashed potatoes.

531
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's not an awful thing.

532
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I never went.

533
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I didn't want to do this.

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Some people love it.

535
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Like that's their go to.

536
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
They're like well we got to eat there.

537
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I mean all I wanted I realized now was for like a character to talk to me.

538
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's why like I really dug that Knott's Berry Farm thing where you would talk to the

539
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
fucking prisoner in the in the jam.

540
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I would run there and I'd spend like 45 minutes there when I was a kid.

541
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Because I just wanted a fictional person to acknowledge me.

542
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah.

543
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This is so weird.

544
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Were you like disappointed by movies always because they don't talk back to you?

545
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I guess so.

546
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't know.

547
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I just wanted to be part of the narrative in some way.

548
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I want to be part of the story.

549
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And another thing I remember was that one time we went to a dinner show in Orlando called

550
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
The Hoop De Doo Review.

551
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh yeah.

552
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Did you guys ever do that?

553
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I did not.

554
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I think I've been.

555
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm pretty sure I've been but I was young and I don't really remember any of it.

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
They would sing this song called I remember going hoop dee doo hoop dee doo and they danced

557
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
around.

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And then you ate chicken.

559
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,600
It was a whole theme show where the characters also had like a relationship with each other.

560
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,560
That is in the record books as like one of the longest continuous running theatrical

561
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
presentations.

562
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
It's amazing.

563
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,440
Because it's been going since I think whenever they open the campground which it was in the

564
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
70s.

565
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Oh wow.

566
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Yeah.

567
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,000
There's a theater and restaurant at the Disney campground where all that happens.

568
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That's cool.

569
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,800
Did you actually camp there?

570
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
You can.

571
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,280
Yeah you can RV camp or there's cabins and stuff.

572
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,160
This is the kind of thing that these specials would show you.

573
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,160
They would like write in a scene where the Mouseketeers are camping or they're like they

574
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
have to.

575
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,880
They're all these like TGIF sitcoms that had to go to Disney World.

576
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,760
They had to like it's all scenes like made to feature you know features of the of the

577
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
resort.

578
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Right.

579
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,240
Sort of tortured narratives that take you like to camping and space and this New England

580
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
place and.

581
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
That's awesome.

582
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Yeah.

583
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,880
Why did I.

584
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,800
The thing with these specials like I don't know why they're like just pure ads.

585
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
They're hours long ads.

586
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,760
Pure propaganda that I loved more than movies.

587
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,240
It was all the possible places you could go to.

588
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Yeah.

589
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Or maybe similarly.

590
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Yeah.

591
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
It's like shopping for an experience.

592
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Yes.

593
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Yeah that's true.

594
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,480
If you watch enough of these specials you know if you do get to go there what you'll

595
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,720
prioritize and what you won't need to see.

596
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Yeah.

597
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Sure.

598
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
It's not a fight.

599
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
It's not a place I want to go.

600
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Yeah.

601
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
But they had a good time.

602
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,040
There's a period I'm sure they made so many of them there's even besides the Disney produced

603
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,400
ones the travel channel for had a period of time where they had so many behind the scenes

604
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,080
at Disney World stuff and very slick travel channel travel channel Food Network kind of

605
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,420
like in and out in 40 minutes like very highly stylized and produced this.

606
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,120
The sickest thing I think that's in this vein is that on on the TVs in the hotels they just

607
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,400
play a continuous loop of what we're talking about specials that show the park the information

608
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,680
and we all have.

609
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Yeah.

610
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,760
And we all have I think everybody has collectively the same like fascination of going back to

611
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,200
the hotel after being out for 12 14 hours in the parks and just watching these channels.

612
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,080
This is a specific memory I have I was going to bring this up is that my parents are at

613
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,120
pleasure island and I'm with my little brother in a hotel room watching the commercial for

614
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,680
pleasure island loop on like a 15 minute loop.

615
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Yes.

616
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,000
Because we just like we think there's this one guy who's a country line dancer who looks

617
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,020
so stupid that we kept waiting for him to come back through and see him again and then

618
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,020
laugh at him.

619
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,520
So we could find this guy.

620
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Oh yeah.

621
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Oh yeah.

622
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Pretty limited materials.

623
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
I'd say it's 92.

624
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
OK yeah.

625
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
We'll try to find it.

626
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
We'll find this guy.

627
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Is this him.

628
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,080
I definitely I definitely he has he's just one guy and he's like his leg is going in

629
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,080
all different directions and he's like squatting and we thought he was so funny.

630
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,560
We found multiple I mean there's tons of theme park stuff on YouTube but the in room information

631
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,960
loops are on YouTube.

632
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
That's awesome.

633
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,680
I like actively avoid it going down that rabbit hole because that's that'll just be days gone.

634
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,360
Like that was like my brother and I that was like our thing was like yeah locating the

635
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,920
worst the funniest part of every one of those.

636
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,640
We're still like I remember we had to live at the desert in for like a week in Vegas

637
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,740
before it closed because no me was performing and there was a video where Suzanne Summers

638
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,280
learned gambling through the spirit of gambling taught it to her and there's a part where

639
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,160
she sang a little song about desert in and how it's fun and we would wait for that part

640
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,360
because we thought it was so funny.

641
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,440
Oh my God.

642
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,880
That is the most of my I like I was looking into this for talking about the American adventure.

643
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,320
There is a there was a thing at Independence Hall where like in Philadelphia where like

644
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,400
spirits come back and revisit the areas or there I went to I went on a factory tour in

645
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,680
Texas of an ice cream factory where like the founder of the company's ghost came back to

646
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,360
see the spirit of gambling and that's something could be more up my alley than you should

647
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,720
try to find it's like from the desert and I think went away like six months later.

648
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,200
So but it was still it was like one of the oldest like people saw to wear like like formal

649
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,360
wear in the casino like cocktail attire which is not anywhere anymore.

650
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,200
Vegas is very heavy at this point.

651
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,640
There were no rascals.

652
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,840
Reminding me I may I may have talked about this on the podcast coming back from like

653
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,780
visiting my family at Christmas just this past Christmas I had got stuck in Vegas overnight

654
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,320
because like the plane missed its connection and so they put us up in like a no name hotel

655
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,760
off of the strip and it was fine but I was just like so tired I just came into the room

656
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,960
and I turned on the TV and before I could even look at what the channels like try and

657
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,280
find a channel to watch the Vegas information channel was on and I'm like well don't need

658
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,640
to change the channel and I just like watch that until I fell asleep and it's stuff where

659
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,640
it's like we're here with the head of the Vegas Margaritaville Las Vegas and I'm just

660
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
like looking at this guy.

661
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
I'm listening.

662
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,960
And yeah Mike's listening and he's like if you come here my picks gotta be either the

663
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,280
Cheeseburger Paradise or the Volcano Nachos and I'm just alone in this hotel room going

664
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,480
like yeah no shit you get the Cheeseburger Paradise or the Volcano Nachos you fucking

665
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,600
idiot don't act like it's like a hidden thing they're the first things on the menu.

666
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,120
Tell us something we don't know.

667
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,040
We were Erin and my wife and I were in Vegas in a couple weeks ago in January and we had

668
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,960
been there in July as well and we like we were in this we were disappointed that the

669
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,960
MGM that the M Resorts video had not been turned over yet because we were there within

670
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
a six month window.

671
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Like is it a new video?

672
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Ah damn it.

673
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,200
It's the fuck it's the Mandalay Bay Dolphins again we've seen it.

674
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,640
Did you see Criss Angel?

675
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Yes yes I did.

676
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Okay good.

677
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
You know that's closing.

678
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Is it?

679
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Oh okay.

680
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
We gotta get out there.

681
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
It's the best worst show on the planet.

682
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:04,360
Yeah I did Criss Angel I saw the the laser rave the the the glowing hula hoop celebration

683
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
of life.

684
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,600
After he uses magic to cure pediatric cancer.

685
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Yeah.

686
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Whoa.

687
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Oh it's nuts.

688
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Whoa.

689
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,720
It's something get out there if you're listening.

690
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,000
You know I have not been disappointed by either.

691
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,960
I did I did Criss Angel and I we talked about it on another one I did David Copperfield.

692
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,240
Do you know about the David Copperfield?

693
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,320
I've been hearing about it from Jason Woliner a lot.

694
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
Yeah he's gone like four or five times.

695
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,520
He saw it we're having him on the show soon he saw it twice in one night he saw the seven

696
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,880
and the nine thirty.

697
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
He's he's for real.

698
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
And he's not wrong.

699
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,520
He's more for real about this shit than anyone I've ever met.

700
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Man how?

701
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Well he's coming up.

702
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,880
If he tells me I gotta see something he told me see Criss Angel the next morning I got

703
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,120
in my car and drove to Vegas by myself and saw it.

704
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
You literally just went?

705
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,160
Yeah the next we were at the Magic Castle and he like explained the whole thing to me

706
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,880
without spoiling and he's like you need to see it immediately.

707
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,720
That's the thing I know why this isn't like nothing for the listener to say see the David

708
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,440
Copperfield show but I can't like you can't spoil it I can't spoil it but like.

709
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,760
I heard about the last act he told me.

710
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,240
Oh okay I can't oh it's just this turn like I'd be so sad if I knew but is he doing it

711
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,400
or is he done?

712
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Is he been ousted?

713
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Copperfield?

714
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,520
There's an article about him.

715
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,920
You gotta get there now.

716
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,120
Yeah if you're listening to this if you're anywhere near Las Vegas just go I can't oh

717
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,920
this last half hour of this Copperfield show you you have to do it you really really have

718
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
to do it.

719
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:51,560
I wish I could say more but it'd be so sad if he'd been

720
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,520
like too drunk to know what was going on.

721
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,560
And then he floats her in the air and makes her vanish.

722
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,000
This must have been what happened.

723
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,640
So she just dies.

724
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,680
Well yeah so he cured it by killing a kid?

725
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,240
Yeah just made her go away.

726
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,320
He put all of the cancer into one kid made that kid go away and other kids were free.

727
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,240
Well that kid sacrificed for the greater good.

728
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Yeah yeah.

729
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,600
There's also a lot of stuff about like where like a saucy lady comes out and she's got

730
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:22,480
blue paint smeared all over her mouth because she she blew one of the blue men group.

731
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
No.

732
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,480
That is a recurring bit.

733
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Yeah yeah sex with the blue men.

734
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Oh wait this is in Criss Angel?

735
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
This is in Criss Angel.

736
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Yeah that's the body.

737
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,560
That wasn't part of the show when I saw it that's a new gag.

738
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,120
Oh okay wow well the magicians they keep it up.

739
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
They change the show.

740
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
They gotta keep reinventing themselves.

741
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,120
That's pretty body.

742
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
There's so much.

743
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,040
Someday we'll get to the topic maybe we won't maybe this will be the first one where we

744
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,160
don't cover the ride and I'm fine with that.

745
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,080
I want to talk about it because I watch the YouTube video.

746
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
I do as well.

747
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,000
Wait here before we is it I feel like I saw a video also where you're dead like inaugurated

748
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Toontown.

749
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Yes I was there for that.

750
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,520
Yes he inaugurated Toontown.

751
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:04,120
They had jello jiggler shaped like the genie that were blue.

752
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,300
For just everyone that was in the VIP area or did everyone who was there get the jello

753
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,300
jigglers?

754
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
I don't know.

755
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,320
They were just out like they were just out.

756
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,160
Was it on a table somewhere?

757
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,040
And then I jumped I was jumping in the bounce house even though I was like a little bit

758
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,300
too old for it and I looked out the window and Mam Bialik was watching me and just sort

759
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,000
of like not interested.

760
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
She was like oh.

761
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Like a showy grown up.

762
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,840
Like I'm not into kids stuff.

763
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,640
No she was just sort of like you shouldn't I don't know I just felt like she was judging

764
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,640
me.

765
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,200
The thing she's the most known for is bouncing around and that blossom opening.

766
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,400
So maybe she was jealous maybe I was taking out the bounce house.

767
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,480
Is there still a bounce house at Toontown?

768
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,320
This is the whole thing.

769
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,440
All the fun of Toontown is gone.

770
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,120
The bounce house is not a bounce house.

771
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,060
The ball pit the Chippendale ball pit is not a not a ball pit and they took the slide out

772
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,060
of Chippendale.

773
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,840
So and there was like a little park where it was all inflatable bushes.

774
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,400
It was all liability I think.

775
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,520
Like lawyers came in.

776
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,120
You could break your neck pretty easy in a bounce house I think.

777
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
Yeah yeah yeah.

778
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:12,600
Disney didn't want to well bounce houses are such kind of like weird low rent kind of like

779
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,800
it's like bounce house rental seems to be a lawless land.

780
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Yeah.

781
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
So like yeah Disney probably didn't want to know.

782
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,660
Yeah kids colliding heads colliding.

783
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:27,160
So when you were at Toontown so did did your feelings on being at these events change as

784
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,240
you got older?

785
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,060
Like did you kind of the scope of actually what was happening and that you were the envy

786
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,120
of every child across the land?

787
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,840
Was that a thing I never talked about with anyone.

788
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
Right.

789
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,600
But I just it was really weird because it was like a pocket of time where we went.

790
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,080
It happened every summer and I never went back.

791
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,800
Like just as soon as like my dad wasn't working with Disney anymore we just never went.

792
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,640
Right I never went to Disneyland again until I was like an adult.

793
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,000
And then I only went to Disney World one more time which was like in 2009.

794
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,400
The last time I'd been there I was like 12.

795
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,280
So I did get to see like the animal kingdom for the first time which was fucking great.

796
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,120
And I got to see all the ruined rides that I loved like Figment was destroyed.

797
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
Oh yeah.

798
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,200
And I got to see the three cabularos and the Mexico ride and all the things I was like

799
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
what did you do?

800
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,600
Yeah but you still got Maelstrom you got regular Maelstrom.

801
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,880
Yeah I did like Maelstrom a lot.

802
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,600
And also when I was there in 2009 it was a weird window where like the I don't know if

803
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,520
this is still true but like a five day pass or a six day pass was only a little bit more

804
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,800
than like a one day pass.

805
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,080
They still do sort of that like where it's like if you just add days on it's like $20

806
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,080
more.

807
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,080
Yeah.

808
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,680
But there was just like it was just really easy to get on rides because people were at

809
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,120
the parks but just like sitting on benches and then you couldn't get any food anywhere

810
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,440
because all the restaurants have been booked up for months.

811
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Oh gotcha.

812
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:56,480
So it was interesting I was like oh this is like this is a this is a failure.

813
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,160
Weird legwork that you have to do in Florida to like to eat decent food besides like counter

814
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,120
service stuff like yeah the reservations if a place is very popular it will like fill

815
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,920
up months in advance.

816
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,280
When I was in Epcot the only place I could eat was Morocco because people were scared.

817
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
Yeah.

818
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,160
Oh yeah like people like my dad are like yeah they serve a boiled rat tail.

819
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Terrorism.

820
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,680
It's weird but it's so beautiful it's like it's beautiful.

821
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
Great restaurant.

822
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Yeah.

823
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,680
And with great stuff.

824
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Yeah.

825
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,320
Yeah I finally did yeah I think one last time I was there I did Morocco.

826
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,160
Yeah that's a legit restaurant.

827
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,960
Well there we're whining or we finally wound our way.

828
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,440
We did get to the World Showcase.

829
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah and the thing that had not changed it barely changed when I went back to Epcot was

830
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,640
American.

831
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,640
The American.

832
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,640
American.

833
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,640
The American adventure.

834
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
Adventure.

835
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,760
I will say like Benjamin Franklin.

836
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,240
Yeah well and it's this is a this is an opening day Epcot attraction that has not really changed

837
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,720
there's been little enhancements and actually just this week as we record this they have

838
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:08,280
done some some enhancement there's a I think they changed the projector I think they added.

839
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,280
Yes a new projector.

840
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Pretty good.

841
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,960
To the Golden Dreams montage at the end.

842
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,120
A new recording of the song Golden Dreams.

843
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,000
People have been waiting for us to address these updates and here we are in the moment.

844
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,720
Epcot spread your golden wings.

845
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,040
Spread your golden wings.

846
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:32,640
A song opening day they had two people sing in person like a duo sing together very weird

847
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
to hear that.

848
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,400
Oh Alan in 82 Epcot opening.

849
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,880
Wow wow.

850
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:45,360
Okay so well the primer on this it's all the way at the back of Epcot Center the furthest

851
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,560
point from the entry it is World Showcase is the area with all of the pavilions representing

852
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,800
nations of the world and at the center of it is this colonial American house and you

853
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:06,480
watch a 25 minute show that is combines film and audio animatronics into a into an American

854
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,200
spectacular event.

855
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,400
Yes and it's very much like it looks like what you would go to it looks like someplace

856
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,440
you would go if it was not in Disney like where you would have been on a field trip.

857
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,600
Oh yeah that's like it's a colonial type house the only difference is you can get an alcoholic

858
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,200
dream sickle drink in front which I did about four months ago.

859
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,240
That is a very American statement.

860
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,040
Yes so I drank that in front of the colonial waiting for the show to begin because you

861
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,800
cannot bring it inside because they're worried you'll ruin the old.

862
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,340
Throw it you'll whip it at Chief Joseph.

863
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,740
You had your time keep your mouth shut.

864
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:48,320
So real quick I want to talk about the American adventure that was not built.

865
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Oh yeah yeah.

866
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,040
I just found this out yesterday.

867
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:58,180
Learning researching this there is initially a plan that the American adventure was going

868
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:02,560
to be like the bridge attraction between future world and World Showcase.

869
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,580
It was going to be a circular building on stilts so you would have to you would have

870
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,600
to literally walk under America to get to the rest of the world.

871
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,560
This this was not built.

872
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:21,280
Another thing that got taken away there of course the hosts of this attraction Ben Franklin

873
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,580
and Mark Twain.

874
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,480
There was originally a third host Will Rogers.

875
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,920
Oh cowboy comedian who does show up in the ride was going to join them.

876
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
Oh man.

877
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Oh man.

878
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
That would have been so annoying.

879
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:41,200
The same caliber of American I feel like as Ben Franklin or Mark Twain.

880
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,520
Would he spin the lariat the whole time?

881
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,280
I have to imagine he would have had that.

882
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,280
He'd have to.

883
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,840
I mean that would be that's part of it right?

884
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,960
He can't do more than more tricks than that.

885
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Yeah yeah right.

886
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Keep it going.

887
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Yeah.

888
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Because it's not a rope.

889
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
He's not a man.

890
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,960
Oh yeah yeah.

891
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Because he can't.

892
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
He's not a man.

893
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
Yes yeah yeah he can't do real rope tricks.

894
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
He's limited.

895
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,640
Yeah and also doesn't Mark Twain fill the if Mark Twain and Benjamin Franklin are a

896
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,480
straight man funny man isn't Mark Twain already the funny man?

897
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,160
I know he'd have to be like straight manning Will Rogers.

898
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,160
Yeah yeah.

899
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
Yeah you'd have to keep it.

900
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
I'm glad they didn't go there.

901
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
Yeah that was a good idea.

902
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,800
I would if we're using comedy lingo I would call them peas in a pod honestly.

903
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,960
Because I feel like they're both riffing a lot.

904
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,880
But Ben Franklin was funny too.

905
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,680
Yeah that's what the show like the opening thing of them in the show is them like zing

906
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:36,640
and they're they're kind of trading bar logans back and forth.

907
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,640
Slow zings.

908
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,760
American slow moving zings.

909
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,320
Slow is kind of the operative word with this thing in general.

910
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,000
Of all of all that we talked about a couple topics but we ended up on this.

911
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,520
Do you have any specific reasons or recollections about the American adventure?

912
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,800
It was my favorite thing.

913
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,280
Yeah I like I loved going to it.

914
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,720
I loved animatronics and I still do and I don't think they've gotten that much better

915
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,400
which is weird like have they really?

916
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,120
A couple I mean the rocket raccoon animatronic famously at California venture is very good.

917
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,600
I have not seen it yet.

918
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:16,260
And then the Olaf on the repurposed maelstrom also moves and like is pretty impressive.

919
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,700
But then Trump's fucking weird.

920
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,800
But Trump's robot is not great.

921
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,800
It's crazy.

922
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,120
I thought the Yeti on the Everest ride at American Animal Kingdom was really.

923
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
Well that's busted.

924
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,120
Yeah.

925
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,120
It's busted?

926
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,120
It's broken on Everest.

927
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
Yeah.

928
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,120
Yeah it's broken.

929
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,120
It hasn't worked in many years.

930
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,600
It's a whole controversy now.

931
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
It worked when I went.

932
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,000
It was it swiped down at you.

933
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It was crazy.

934
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm happy for you I swear.

935
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
That's a rare thing.

936
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,400
That's crazy.

937
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,480
So yeah I just think it's I mean actually I didn't I watched the YouTube video of it

938
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,480
last night and I didn't realize like it starts with well first of all I just liked it.

939
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,440
I liked all the history.

940
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:03,040
I made me feel like very smart to go to it and like it.

941
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,000
And and but I didn't realize till I watched it that like it starts with this very weird

942
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,440
scene between Twain and Ben Franklin and then there's like seven minutes of just like songs

943
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,280
and no animatronics pushing into paintings.

944
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,380
It's just pushing into paintings and telling you about like a bunch of like the pilgrims

945
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,920
getting cold and stuff.

946
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,200
And then they die.

947
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,040
There is a very unique logic to some of the ride where it's like anything in American

948
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,920
history before the invention of the photograph is paintings and drawings.

949
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,960
And then during once you get to the point you've been like there's the Civil War sequence

950
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,480
the two brothers sequence which we'll get to.

951
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,640
That's all photographs.

952
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,560
And eventually you get to silent films and then more film stuff starts to show.

953
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Right but they do do animatronics of like those two guys talking mad shit on Washington.

954
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Yes.

955
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,940
Which I think is the best one because the horse the way the horse moves is really sort

956
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:07,920
of like he's silently sitting on that mountain and they're like ah if we don't starve cursed

957
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,320
Washington we've got dysentery.

958
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,480
They're just like yelling.

959
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,920
Congress sits in their warm houses.

960
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,560
Oh man so good.

961
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:26,120
The about my where I'm coming from with this attraction.

962
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:32,680
So when I was a kid I was a big I was really into history as well as a kid.

963
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,000
I was really into the presidents specifically for some reason I really revered presidents

964
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,520
and there was a story my mom told me where I just like I don't know if I just vaguely

965
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,280
heard someone criticizing the president President George Bush senior of just some vague criticism

966
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,640
and I came home upset maybe crying upset.

967
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,640
Wow.

968
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,520
The idea that somebody would be critical of our president.

969
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,260
Were your parents like conservative or where'd you get this from?

970
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,080
They were not they are today.

971
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,520
They're all Trump heads and this would be the one my mom would listen to if she listens

972
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,760
to us so hey mom do your thing.

973
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,200
But the no but they weren't really I think I just my mom.

974
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,480
You respected the office.

975
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,720
I think yeah yeah yeah.

976
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,280
Respect the office.

977
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,720
Yeah I really did and I remember there was a poll of like when he ran against Clinton

978
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,240
there was a poll of like who the classroom wants to be.

979
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Yes right right.

980
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:34,440
Clinton won in the class and I was upset about that I was like we have to support our president

981
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,280
like the idea that the president could be challenged upset me for some reason.

982
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,640
Oh man were you think your parents were like oh Scott's such a nerd.

983
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,720
Oh yeah well here's how it broke down.

984
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,600
My mom with all this was like I raised the perfect child.

985
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,200
I rate like exactly the kid I imagined I would have and here he is and he's perfect and wonderful.

986
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,080
My dad was kind of like hey we got to fix Scott.

987
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:04,160
We got to nudge him over because I was also like a around the point where she also mission

988
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,880
accomplished on history.

989
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,760
And she got me really into Broadway and I remember when I by the time I was really deep

990
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,480
into a thing called Forbidden Broadway.

991
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Oh God yes yes.

992
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,480
Forbidden Broadway.

993
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,520
It's been a whole thing because you know how they are showing Spamilton and in their signs

994
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,960
for Spamilton that's a Forbidden Broadway Hamilton.

995
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,520
And my boyfriend was going to take yeah so explain Forbidden Broadway.

996
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,040
Forbidden Broadway is like a parody of Broadway shows.

997
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,040
Yeah it's like a review.

998
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,360
A review that ran for a long time where that would be like the greatest hits of whatever's

999
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:42,320
the big shows at the moment whether it's Evita or Phantom of the Opera, Cats or whatever.

1000
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:49,720
And yeah just sort of a you know like a capital steps sort of like a parody a satire.

1001
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:56,280
But that's like making fun of like specific issues people have with like the leading man's

1002
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
over acting.

1003
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:04,520
Like it'll be like it's like very inside baseball of people even who like work on Broadway.

1004
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,860
They had a song I remembered that was making fun of it was a song from Guys and Dolls making

1005
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:14,720
fun of Marlon Brando's mumbly singing voice in the Guys and Dolls movie.

1006
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
Oh that's the level.

1007
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,800
Oh so that was like you were doing like I was like I was in Forbidden Broadway volume

1008
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:25,520
two which is making fun of how like how hammy George Hearn was in the La Cage a Fall musical.

1009
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,480
So it was just like oh like Bernadette Peters in the revival of Anything Goes.

1010
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,040
There was a song about to the tune of Anything Goes I don't remember the statement of it.

1011
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,040
Patti LuPone.

1012
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,040
Oh wow.

1013
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:46,600
Oh I can't believe we both know the Patti LuPone parody.

1014
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,280
What was the stance on Patti LuPone?

1015
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,800
Do we have any idea was she you know was she was it a tribute do they like Patti LuPone?

1016
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,760
In olden days the show was shocking cause Merman would keep them rocking but now they

1017
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,760
phone Patti LuPone.

1018
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Wow.

1019
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,360
Okay I must have had that so wait was Patti LuPone in the 70s or 80s or something?

1020
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,320
Mike is completely curled back against the couch.

1021
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,920
I don't know what to make of this.

1022
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,320
My wife currently is listening to this and cringing on both of our behalf she's like

1023
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,920
gnarled up hearing all of this.

1024
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,560
My boyfriend couldn't take his daughter had already seen Hamilton with her mom and he

1025
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,680
was like should I take her to Spamilton and I had a sneaking suspicion so I found Spamilton

1026
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:34,800
on Spotify and it's like raps about the theater that did Hamilton.

1027
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
Oh my god.

1028
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,800
And like.

1029
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,360
Jokes about the theater itself.

1030
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,760
About the production of Hamilton on Broadway like I can't imagine an LA audience even understanding

1031
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,600
what any of it is about.

1032
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,400
The Niedenheimers or whatever it's called.

1033
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
It's just about like or like you know.

1034
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,240
Like yo they need better bathroom flow.

1035
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,400
It's just about like and it's like all about Lin-Manuel Miranda and like his perception

1036
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,360
of himself in the community of Broadway.

1037
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,480
It was like so crazy and I was like you I was like I wish I hadn't played this for you.

1038
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,960
I wish you'd just gone to.

1039
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,960
Is it a full length?

1040
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Yeah it's a full show.

1041
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,000
It's a full show and it's all just parodies of Broadway.

1042
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,400
It's just the business of Broadway.

1043
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Yeah.

1044
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,880
Did it just keep going or did it stop at a certain point?

1045
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,400
Is there still a spin in Broadway?

1046
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
This is Spamilton.

1047
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
Oh now it's Spamilton.

1048
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Yeah but I was like.

1049
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,840
They probably had a field day with Sutton Foster and Wicked.

1050
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,080
Oh yeah I mean look it up.

1051
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,080
When I.

1052
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,080
What are you a channel with?

1053
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,440
When I was in college they did Forbidden Hollywood.

1054
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
Yeah I knew Forbidden Hollywood.

1055
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,960
That's what the Guys and Dolls thing was from.

1056
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,600
They did they had a song that was like it was like.

1057
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,080
It was like about like Disney taking over the world.

1058
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,200
There was one that was like Cameron Diaz and like two other people and they were just like

1059
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,080
it was like it was a parody of You Oughta Be In Pictures but it was like you've we shouldn't

1060
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,080
be in pictures.

1061
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,440
Oh yeah it was Juliette Lewis.

1062
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,920
They were making fun of Juliette Lewis being like a flat bath.

1063
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,920
Valley girl kind of actress.

1064
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,000
Uh okay.

1065
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
This is wild.

1066
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Before we keep delving into these terrible.

1067
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Okay you're into Broadway.

1068
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You're into Broadway.

1069
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,080
The point is Forbidden Broadway was the point of no return from my dad where he took my.

1070
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,160
I always suspected that this event happened and I confirmed it several years ago.

1071
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,000
I said did was there a point where you took my mom aside and said no more of this shit

1072
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and it did happen.

1073
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Wow.

1074
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
He was like I have to get my son back in shape which I think started with you know kind of

1075
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,240
like but you know it wasn't like giving me a beer but it was like buying me Mad Magazine.

1076
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,160
He did course corrects because.

1077
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,480
He was trying to get you because you couldn't talk to anyone about any of this stuff.

1078
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,960
Oh yeah imagine me in like an elementary school.

1079
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,800
I have a really specific elementary school memory of meeting somebody who also liked

1080
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:53,360
the Simpsons and like oh my God a fellow Simpsons fan well you must love when they make fun

1081
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,720
of the mediocre presidents.

1082
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,680
There's a song about how William Henry Harrison died in 30 days and this kid stares at me

1083
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,400
is like Homer's funny.

1084
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,840
Like that was the level.

1085
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,840
That was as close as I could come to relating to another kid.

1086
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:14,040
So yeah I'll always be thankful to my dad for steering me not that is this correct where

1087
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,040
I'm at now I don't know.

1088
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,560
He just tried to create a baseline of like sanity.

1089
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,120
He's like it's look it's gonna be bad no matter what.

1090
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,440
Let's just kind of get it into it like vaguely the playing field of regular humanity.

1091
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,920
This is a full nother podcast but I wonder if the three of us were more influenced by

1092
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,860
what our moms liked because I have a similar thing where like I was like way into the monkeys

1093
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:43,240
and I was way into like 60s pop and it's like because my mom forced me to hear and obviously

1094
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:49,120
like I like all that stuff now and it's really good but I do wonder if maybe that is a common

1095
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:54,960
ality maybe it's this podcast mama's boys that might be what I'm getting at Jason theme

1096
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,960
park spin off.

1097
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,160
I both my parents like theme parks and mystery novels and that's all I like.

1098
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,440
All right oh they're a match made in heaven.

1099
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:07,480
Yeah well no they got the worst enough for years ago.

1100
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,120
For a while they were.

1101
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:16,000
Yeah I don't know my parents were very encouraging of my pursuits probably because like I was

1102
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,560
very nervous child.

1103
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:23,320
So I think anytime they're like oh good a thing where he goes off with other kids.

1104
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,460
That said your your Simpsons story does remind me of when I would talk to other kids about

1105
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:31,640
theme park like like like oh you went to Disney World somehow about alien encounters you know

1106
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,040
like this thing what about the pre-show.

1107
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah kids would be like yeah it was good I was scared or it was just I was like I got

1108
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,240
I got saved.

1109
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,820
Did you save your maps like you know that in the Magic Kingdom in Florida the ship is

1110
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,800
called the Joe Fowler not the Mark Twain imagineer.

1111
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:52,880
And in 20 years time I'll be piloting it as I turn 30.

1112
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,880
It's a miracle.

1113
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,480
Look there's a lot of miracles.

1114
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,080
It's a miracle that we anyone will talk to any of us it's a miracle we met each other.

1115
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,080
Like imagine back then the hopelessness of like.

1116
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
There's no Reddit.

1117
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,360
Oh yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah well that's why I was big on theme park internet when

1118
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:13,160
it opened up like in middle school I'm on all of these like deep message boards and

1119
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,200
everything that replaced friends.

1120
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,640
I mean we would get Disney Adventure at the house like we had a subscription to that we

1121
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,920
had a subscription to Disney Magazine the Vacation Club had its own magazine so it

1122
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,800
was all yeah it was everywhere.

1123
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,960
He's setting you on a course.

1124
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,000
So you were really into presidents and Broadway.

1125
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,800
So that's that's okay where was all that heading.

1126
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,580
I think there's a story coming up about when you went to Orlando.

1127
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:41,600
So yeah with all this I'm this kid I'm this this deep this forbidden Broadway kid and

1128
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,560
then knowing that there is I remember on the plane reading the Burn Bombs Guide Disney

1129
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:50,280
World and it's a show where 35 audio animatronics come to life and Benjamin Franklin and Mark

1130
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,280
Benjamin Franklin climbs up stairs I'm so thrilled for this and like all the whole day

1131
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,880
is a build up to it and we took the boats across the lagoon and there it is it's getting

1132
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,320
getting bigger and bigger in view and then getting off the boats to the sign that the

1133
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:11,320
American adventure is being refurbished and it was the the deepest despair that I have

1134
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,240
I'm sure if there was video of it it is like a temper tantrum to end all temper tantrums

1135
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:21,760
like worse than a level of crying it is worse than any like breakup I've had just like the

1136
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,920
deepest deepest and my I talked to my mom about this last night and she was like I really

1137
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,280
I didn't know what to do it was a challenge as a parent in that moment to figure out how

1138
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,320
to calm you down I believe that she ended up saying well look the rotunda is open you

1139
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:41,240
can still see the Voices of Liberty acapella group and I think that did give me the the

1140
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,220
boost of colonial energy.

1141
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,400
How old were you again?

1142
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,200
I would say like seven.

1143
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Wow.

1144
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Yeah.

1145
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,080
But in all of that like kids look forward to going to Disney World like that it's that

1146
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,840
it's roller coasters or it's meet Mickey Mouse I want to see Benjamin Franklin climb those

1147
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,560
stairs and I don't get to and I weep.

1148
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
That's crazy.

1149
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,360
Oh man it's great though.

1150
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,480
Yeah it's great I mean I will admit I was not nerdy for this when I was that age though

1151
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,480
I was much more I think yeah I like this stuff.

1152
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,560
I always kind of knew it was insane.

1153
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,560
Yeah but I was.

1154
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,440
I just I like thought it was very like educational.

1155
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,000
Uh huh.

1156
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,800
There's that other perspective as you said with Chief Joseph it's not a it's not a totally.

1157
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,600
Frederick Douglass.

1158
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,720
It's one of the rare Disney things that doesn't just go be like America was great wasn't it?

1159
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,720
And it's like anti Song of the South.

1160
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,160
It shows some complications.

1161
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,460
It shows some I mean look it could do a better job let's be honest it's not like it's some

1162
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:45,160
amazingly nuanced thing it's yeah but still like you're like I because I we saw it a couple

1163
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,360
months ago and I was like oh yeah OK.

1164
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,280
They're acknowledging that maybe America hasn't been the best country in the world for it

1165
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,800
was like a six year break like in 2006 my family went and we didn't go back down to

1166
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,840
like 2012 and I remember like we were at Epcot one day and everyone had been there for a

1167
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,420
while and was kind of tired and I was like oh you know what we haven't done the American

1168
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:11,960
adventure and like half of the behalf of us were like I don't need to and then me and

1169
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,440
my dad were like oh we'll go watch it and I went and watched it and I was like I forgot

1170
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:22,040
this I forgot all of it and then like later we all met up for dinner and I'm like do you

1171
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:27,460
the American event and I was explaining it and and we were leaving the next day so the

1172
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,520
everyone else was just like oh my God why didn't you why didn't anyone remember that

1173
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,560
so then we went back like two years later everyone made sure to watch it this time like

1174
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,320
it is yeah it's something it's nuts yeah let me say then the other side of that for me

1175
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:48,160
because as much as I loved it as a kid today I like made a real point when I went to Disney

1176
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,500
World the first time with Aaron my wife made a real point of like oh we got to see this

1177
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:58,440
it's this you know the 35 animatronics and she is like from minute three like oh like

1178
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,080
she and like and in the last couple days when I've been talking about it and putting on

1179
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:07,760
videos of it and everything same thing just like come on God and I like she landed on

1180
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,120
that we landed on that part you were talking about where it's just pushes in on paintings

1181
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,080
for a while and I was justifying it like well you know this is pre Ken Burns so push in

1182
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:22,480
on a painting not oh God she's been so frustrated hearing about and end quote Aaron this morning

1183
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:29,600
I will I will only listen to this episode because of the guest oh yeah thanks for the

1184
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,480
shack glad you're hope you're still with us or we're divorced now because of all that

1185
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,600
forbidden Broadway material but anyway so I would like to present the point of view

1186
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,080
and I don't I'm not trying to just make up for my dorky past I think I am with her and

1187
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,120
that like this thing is pretty ponderous well it's a little rough oh it's just people talking

1188
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,360
about stuff yes certainly it is the average theme park person or theme park goer I should

1189
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:00,240
say is bored by it and I think it starts in the lobby so when we were there a couple months

1190
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,000
ago the big lobby has like paintings and there's exhibits and interesting stuff and and and

1191
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,880
talking about American history almost everyone in there could care less there is one man

1192
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,760
though and I don't know if he's there all the time that works there that cares so much

1193
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:24,320
about American history and everything that is in there and he tries his very best to

1194
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:29,760
shout over just like people talking like people in the lobby just talk and he's trying to

1195
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:36,440
tell them about things and no one's paying any attention to him and he and on the even

1196
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,000
on the way out he comes around to the exit and there's flags and different things show

1197
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,860
I just various pieces artifacts and he is shouting over all these people that could

1198
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:52,800
be could care less about what the significance of each of these things are and it's crazy

1199
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,480
to watch because he cares he works there who knows what his politics are does he like Trump

1200
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,400
he might but I don't know but he cares so much about his job and working there and he

1201
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:07,880
probably takes very like pride in what he does and tourists ignore him day in day out

1202
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,920
and that is probably what happens on this ride all people go what is this thing oh when

1203
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,360
they sit there and they go what the oh god a video okay well I'll sit down for 25 minutes

1204
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:24,840
theme park theme park docent is what he is yes that's not a job usually yeah because

1205
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:30,080
everything it's you're all you're essentially ultimately talking about fake history it's

1206
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,560
weird to be super versed right because like what is he pointing out what's in the are

1207
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:40,360
there historic like flag yes there are flags and stuff artifacts yes but he like all the

1208
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,320
types of flags that America yeah there's a lot of yeah state flags and past versions

1209
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:50,840
of the American flag and but yeah he knows like it seems like he knows everything and

1210
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:58,320
no one gives a shit no one cares keep it up man it's a sisyphenian sisyphenian sisyphenian

1211
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,040
yeah and hey we're with you but I'm going similar to the hall of presidents where it's

1212
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,000
like it's a good place for dad to take a nap in a dark air-conditioned place yes worst

1213
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,600
case yeah nothing's gonna like shit maybe maybe when the muskets get fired he'll wake

1214
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,640
up but if not he can probably just nap through it and it'll be okay and because he just had

1215
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,200
that dream sickle alcoholic drink yeah so he's nice and loose I remember a few years

1216
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:31,240
ago starting what I will admittedly call a very annoying bit based on this ride where

1217
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,680
it's just like in the middle of conversation or lulls of conversation just started saying

1218
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:42,320
well I guess we should explain first the two brothers sequence oh yeah I knew this song

1219
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:49,120
in my heart when I heard it again yeah so this is it's it's the video portion of it

1220
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,720
is in great moments with mr. Lincoln in Disneyland oh it is but not the animatronics animatronic

1221
01:10:54,720 --> 01:11:03,020
is great so what I guess we're at the Civil War yeah so there's a Civil War sequence start

1222
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,680
of photography so here's when photos start showing up in the ride a family is sitting

1223
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:14,880
for a photograph and that one brother is anti slavery and one is very much pro slavery yeah

1224
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,880
and and they're like stop fighting you're gonna ruin mom's birthday and she's like nothing

1225
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:26,320
could ruin my birthday yeah I've got both my sons here yeah foreshadowing what's going

1226
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:33,280
to happen 45 seconds later yeah also I'd like to point out the part where like you know

1227
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,220
they're trying to be civil but then like one of them snips of the other you would say that

1228
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:46,400
Johnny Reb yeah when I was trying to like get back on the side of this ride you're this

1229
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:51,440
attraction you end up with things like that I'm like I don't know this is a struggle I

1230
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,920
wonder a lot watching it if we would accept these words from humans yeah are we just impressed

1231
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:03,360
because they're robots we're allowing them to not be good at acting yes every every segment

1232
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:09,420
in this is the ham-fisted version of this story and this is like it's all these still

1233
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,800
photographs from the Civil War the one brothers for the north the ones for the south and you

1234
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,440
see him in the photo at the beginning of the montage and then at the end one of them is

1235
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:25,320
dead and there is a song about like two brothers go to war so that was the thing I would just

1236
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,560
do to annoy my family is in the middle of conversation yeah you're terrible person for

1237
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:37,040
doing that you did sing that exactly like they sing it in this it's a really really

1238
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:45,820
yeah in great moments with mr. Lincoln it is the low point of the whole show isn't it

1239
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:52,720
weird that you're watching it in Disneyland and it's a photo of robots you were only in

1240
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:58,000
Disney World that's yeah bizarre little they're not based on an actual photo I think it's

1241
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,520
a real I think it must be real actors but the actors look exactly like the robots right

1242
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,280
there's a lot of strange levels there mr. Brady to oh I wrote down there a cannonball

1243
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:23,280
don't pay no mind gentle or if you're kind it's just so serious sorry Aaron and before

1244
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,880
this I guess this is also very uh Fred like Frederick Douglass on that raft oh yeah and

1245
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,760
he's talking about how much he thinks Uncle Tom's Cabin is gonna turn it all around yes

1246
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,000
he did not write yeah he just he likes it and then it goes right to those brothers and

1247
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,400
one of them is like Douglas is the kind of guy that got us into this yeah that's the

1248
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,360
first line of that to like transits was like whoa buddy also my association with Frederick

1249
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:54,120
Douglass is as an orator or an author not a guy cruising a raft through the bayou yeah

1250
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,960
that is very strange it is impressive they got this raft to move sideways because that's

1251
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,040
that's a thing I learned about this ride everything is underneath like the stage is only like

1252
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:09,600
eight feet deep and everything else rises up or slides in from the side yeah this is

1253
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,400
a question I had about how it's all put together like where are all those robots because there's

1254
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,740
a ton of giant yeah sets not just the robots but they're also here's Theodore Roosevelt

1255
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:25,160
on a big cliff but the World's Fair is really crazy there oh yeah oh yeah this is what the

1256
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,800
the schematics look like and the blue is like all of the set pieces rise up from the ground

1257
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:37,800
under your seats in the theater this giant platform like as needed there's eight steps

1258
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:42,360
of this big platform and it scoots up and then the first performers come up the first

1259
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,760
Mark Twain Benjamin Franklin keeps moving some of the robots are on the side of the

1260
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,960
stage and they always stay where they are and just rise into position but this is like

1261
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,000
yeah the the mechanics and the rigs and the hydraulics on this thing are insane do you

1262
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,400
think that they as they were building this ever entertained the idea that this would

1263
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:05,720
replace acting maybe they were where they were probably worried ethically like is this

1264
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:10,600
yeah are we in the in the way that like you know we're putting Fred Astaire in the vacuum

1265
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,440
commercial or whatever like is this where are we opening Pandora's box will this be

1266
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,680
the end of entertainment as we know it or it was like a precursor to replacing like

1267
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:24,740
Ford Motor Company employees with robots so it was just like this is the early version

1268
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:30,120
of automation replacing humans well because everything's been mechanized for a long time

1269
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,280
but maybe people miss that human touch and the idea that there's a lot of people in a

1270
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:40,160
factory so they're gonna have Will Rogers duplicates making the car lots many whoa that

1271
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,800
would be great spirit of America like robots working at McDonald's but it's like well it's

1272
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:51,080
like Ray Kroc yeah all Ray Kroc said McDonald or like Ronald or grimace or something yeah

1273
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:56,800
I mean that's Donald's employees but I think this is better you're out animatronics everywhere

1274
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:03,160
yeah I would that's such a good idea that they should do I'm into it yeah like can we

1275
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:08,080
you want to talk about specific animatronics or sequences that we can we talk about the

1276
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:18,120
song yes yeah yeah please which which dreams golden dreams oh yeah um America there's several

1277
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:26,960
types of wings mentioned wings of time wings of change and also golden wings except a lot

1278
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:33,140
of different wings in play in the song what are your feelings on the song I just I came

1279
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:36,680
in the time between I let like when I saw it as a child and saw it as an adult they

1280
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:41,840
had added 9-11 yeah that's where a lot of the changes have come well the animatronics

1281
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:48,560
got changed out in 93 still look pretty good more more lifelike and and then the song has

1282
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,520
been shortened and lengthened over the years and the montage that goes along with the song

1283
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,280
is changed who's the most recent animatronic like okay so this show takes you all through

1284
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,920
American history that two brothers thing is the midpoint civil war and then who maybe

1285
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:07,640
it's I want to say like Theodore Roosevelt FDR and Will Rogers oh yeah and then past

1286
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:13,120
that point it's all movies and they have got will every decade or so update the film at

1287
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:20,080
the end set to the soaring song golden dreams with like new inspiring Americans the last

1288
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,400
one is the ladies fixing the ship oh like oh yeah Rosie the Riveter on Christmas Day

1289
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,640
and it goes straight from that to America spread your golden wings and to 9-11 yeah

1290
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:36,960
yeah the 40s are it and then you're 9-11 the golden dream starts with us winning World

1291
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:47,280
War II and the rest is movie like 19 or 45 and Warren's 45 11 to present yeah 70 years

1292
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:52,320
and they just added three new people to the do you guys have that yeah there's more they

1293
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,280
the press release only listed three but we watched it and there are more the big ones

1294
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:02,520
that were mentioned were John Williams Neil deGrasse Tyson is in there yeah but if you

1295
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:07,080
watch the whole thing where they have the list they took out Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong

1296
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:12,080
their legacies have been a little tarnished since last updated I believe Louie they took

1297
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:19,600
out Louie oh yeah Louie's gone Kevin Spacey is gone leaving Aziz for now the 13 reasons

1298
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:30,060
why author is gone Neil LeBute is also no longer in it well why was James Toback ever

1299
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:37,920
in yeah no pay his way in this his robot is still on the ride though yeah yeah the

1300
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:45,560
James Toback author tries to pitch you on a new movie passenger seat of his car he presses

1301
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:52,600
up against you in his giant pants on the way to dinner with Barry Levinson did he really

1302
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:59,320
make Bugsy mr. Franklin there's an Alec Baldwin animatronic outside defending him I also like

1303
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:05,600
so it ends though after golden dreams it ends with the they're in the the Statue of Liberty's

1304
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:13,160
torch mm-hmm it's the two of them Franklin Twain in the torch and they present the idea

1305
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:19,600
that maybe the biggest problem with America is that it's had too much success yeah this

1306
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:25,280
leisure and free time no Empire has ever gotten past this it's weird like I think we'll be

1307
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:33,240
just fine can you tell this was opened in 1980 yeah tell this was a Reagan era attraction

1308
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:38,480
this is 20 years past the futurists who were like in the future everything will be automated

1309
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,960
so we're gonna have to come up with great new leisure activities because no one's gonna

1310
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:49,840
have to work and then by 82 it's already like can't have too much leisure must work for

1311
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:57,160
these good companies imagine a box where comedians can type funny jokes that they think of and

1312
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:03,320
observations and they'll be able to do that and not beg senators put to not kill them

1313
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:11,760
and save immigrants from being it's gonna stay real fun yeah well there is a very oddly

1314
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,120
prescient exchange of dialogue which is well mr. Twain what do you think of our America

1315
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:27,200
now Twain are well our founding fathers never dreamed of an America like this fairly they

1316
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,560
also I want to point out the line here's boy this this one this one gets the loudest Aaron

1317
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,960
ugh of all I may have invented these bifocals I'm wearing but I can assure you they are

1318
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:46,800
not I cried because I didn't get to see this as a child I couldn't watch the bifocals

1319
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:52,000
wisecrack they were both masters of quips I could not get to it fast enough like I loved

1320
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,080
it so much and it's the farthest point it was the farthest all the way across all the

1321
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,040
many acres unless you enter from that other secret or take the boat yeah that's right

1322
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:07,600
my favorite attractions were always American adventure adventure experience adventure yeah

1323
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:15,200
um figment yeah and pirates so I think I just liked animatronics yeah everyone and those

1324
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:22,680
all have many many animatronics with personality yes yeah yeah the the pirates faces are so

1325
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:26,960
I think we've talked about that before the pirates faces like suggest character more

1326
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:32,640
character than most human faces because they're slightly cartoonish and there's also like

1327
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:39,680
look I think animatronics really excel when it's like weird grouchy men which obviously

1328
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:46,320
which I you know a dream finder is he's a busy he's a beard Oh like character actor

1329
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:52,440
men like that's what robots the best robots are like I see with him typically yes some

1330
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:58,280
crusty oddball guy and this face isn't gonna move that much he's not he doesn't feel like

1331
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:03,920
exerting the effort no now I say that where in my mind I think like the blockiness of

1332
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,260
a robot lends itself to but oh you know weird grizzled male animatronics but like now I'm

1333
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:14,160
thinking about women do we think like like women like female animatronics are in my mind

1334
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:20,200
they're like not as good what am I arguing here exactly like I maybe like a lot of old

1335
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:27,800
men built these attractions and they knew how to make better we've got woman chasing

1336
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,200
a pirate trying to kiss him yeah well they're pretty she's pretty good in this she's pretty

1337
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,420
good other women fixing the ship are pretty good yeah yeah yeah flips up her hood which

1338
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:42,640
is pretty yeah that looks cool mask oh right right yeah yeah sure are there any like uh

1339
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:48,120
are female animatronics attractive ever or is this the artful or make them weird yeah

1340
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,760
you're right the red is attractive just a rabbit is there one of those oh yeah and the

1341
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,080
red the rabbit right right I she must be concerned about it making everyone too horny so yeah

1342
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:04,120
I think you're right I think you're right you get like a aerial animatronic in the mermaid

1343
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,440
ride oh sure yeah once they got rid of that spinning hair which is kind of weird like

1344
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:13,000
when it opened the hair was the hair was a whole controversy yeah yeah they fixed it

1345
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,940
up is it now is it um Jennifer Tilly always in the globe in the crystal ball no they never

1346
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:22,240
did that there's talk of them doing that because I think she's very sexy the woman inside the

1347
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,160
crystal ball oh Madame Leota yeah but she's not a she's an she's a hologram yeah yeah

1348
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,840
well Scott wants just don't find the hottest animatronic he's just trying to figure out

1349
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:35,360
what uh that's an episode we'll build to yeah who's the hottest animatronic we'll run out

1350
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,880
of topics and we'll have to get to like that like a magan episode an issue of maxim another

1351
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:49,000
podcast ride for men a line from the torch uh that I I do think is solid the golden age

1352
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:55,580
was never the present age uh oh yeah helpful to remember because I I feel like we've heard

1353
01:23:55,580 --> 01:24:01,360
or seen people exclaiming the golden age of podcasting or the golden age of comedy right

1354
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,940
in the middle of it and where it's not real the best way we're in it right now declare

1355
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:11,940
things the golden age when you have zero perspective on the current moment yeah declaring things

1356
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:15,800
to be the golden age and that they will last forever but this episode will be declared

1357
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,840
the golden this oh yeah this is as yeah yeah this is the golden age of podcast the ride

1358
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:26,920
yeah it's only a slow decline from here this is it spread your golden wings everybody um

1359
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:33,560
I hate the oh well also well a couple other things to mention the uh the bizarre uh handshake

1360
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:39,900
yes that's uh that is the climax that is the grand finale that's the ball on indiana jones

1361
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:45,920
that's the dinosaur on the jurassic park ride that's the big finish it's two robots shaking

1362
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:52,720
hands that's it sort of do you think they touch uh no I mean they don't they can't it's

1363
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,520
it's an allude I think it what an illusion it is it's just two hands going like this

1364
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,520
uh you know it was better in the video I wonder if they've plussed it up recently or it looked

1365
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,880
good in the video yeah you know it wasn't too bad we made fun of it at the time but

1366
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:12,840
uh it's also with this then the song kind of refrains and then they like whisper to

1367
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,520
each other oh yeah that was so weird it seems like they're still having a conversation yeah

1368
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,240
that we can't hear it's like when news anchors keep talking well the credits are not real

1369
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:26,400
yeah what are they talking about but that's like those little touches like the trump robot

1370
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,640
rubbing his creepy fingers together that's like yeah like they're adding those human

1371
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:36,480
things and then like looking mad at himself for doing it yeah yeah what is that yeah that's

1372
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:41,400
how you take it do you want to go back in the torch and get the john björn and teddy

1373
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:46,440
roosevelt day out of atronic's and we'll just see what happens you know drink some scotch

1374
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:52,280
smoke some stogies some stogies you know we have this place all night yeah I was like

1375
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:58,480
watching that just so that's such a weird choice to have them just keep having a conversation

1376
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:04,420
yeah we know they are not humans uh-huh but they have them sort of be like like did they

1377
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,500
write fake walla like did someone write like what they would be saying and then or they

1378
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:15,440
just mouth open mouth close is their logic probably if they imagine the imagineers are

1379
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:20,120
very nerdy weird guys so it they probably do have something they're saying so we could

1380
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:27,000
find out their mouths and like damn it darn you it's like yeah pg-13 or they're like complaining

1381
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,720
about the house like uh the house wasn't very full tonight or like did you hear no one clapped

1382
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:39,560
no one clapped at golden dreams they did the check drop too early or go yeah good show

1383
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:47,200
old boy yeah another good another one we do 12 24 a day see you on the next round sir

1384
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:51,840
i also think the way the the gas station the men sitting on the gas station which is a

1385
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,240
long sequence because it's it's the stock market crashes the the one guy sings brother

1386
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:05,200
can you spare the spare a dime and then pearl harbor and will rogers yeah so like they're

1387
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:10,280
they're listening to a lot they spent a lot of years listening on the radio the old radio

1388
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:15,040
together yeah yeah it's funny that it ties together you think you're done with the gas

1389
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,560
station and then will rogers finishes and we go back will rogers's stuff is like it's

1390
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,080
it's all folksy like he's complaining about how they're cutting the money up for the navy

1391
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:29,300
it's very specific grievance he has it seems like we don't know how to fight a war till

1392
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:35,160
we get into one yeah yes what was what do we know about will rogers exactly was he the

1393
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:40,400
uh see the john stewart of his time it seems like people act like yeah like he was a real

1394
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:45,880
like he would he was a topical commentator and he would uh yeah he would be amusing and

1395
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,520
while he did it uh i think it's homespun wisdom somebody's got to bring back the lasso trevor

1396
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:57,200
noah yeah you want a way to stand out in the crowded political rant game get a lasso out

1397
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:02,600
yeah last week tonight starts back up tomorrow what if todahler is just last we can never

1398
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:10,760

1399
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,440
la called the breakfast club which would meet on wednesday mornings and eat breakfast together

1400
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,720

1403
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:36,940
to sing old-timey songs with them and do a secret handshake where it's like eggs and

1404
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:42,760
bacon and you flip your hands over and then someone delivers like a lecture um you guys

1424
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:42,800
one um what have we missed uh uh you know the uh i don't want to move out of the attraction

1425
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:49,200
entirely but don't forget as all uh epcot countries are it's an entire pavilion with

1426
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:54,240
all kinds of restaurants and fun to enjoy why in the american gardens theater you can

1427
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:59,560
witness seasonal entertainment one time they had lord of the dance without michael flatley

1428
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:04,640
uh it's a different just a generic lord of the dance there was a show called barrage

1429
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:09,640
which was a dance and fiddle show so there's always something good happening sure yeah

1430
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:14,600
they perform the nativity there too right yes the candlelight processional which uh

1431
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:21,040
is a yeah like a recitation of the nativity that happens here at disneyland in the at

1432
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:26,160
the railroad station but in epcot it's at the american adventure uh they get i i was

1433
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,680
thinking that they were it was usually like stars who were a little uh over the hill or

1434
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:35,040
a little more c-list but russell will do this thing you'll watch kurt russell read the read

1435
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:41,200
the story of christ's birth um not bad i read did it one year really yeah wow wow they have

1436
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,720
a neglected group of people like some people that have been associated with disney and

1437
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:49,320
then just like oh no i guess chris hemsworth did it out here i was shocked by that chris

1438
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,680
hemsworth yeah doing the nativity it's like kind of a thing i think cool thing but like

1439
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,160
neil patrick harris i mean obviously he's gonna do it he's uh yeah he can't say he's

1440
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:02,360
a nerd for this shit i can't say no to that yeah i think he's gonna say no to it no trust

1441
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:07,040
is this a thing we can campaign for oh yeah maybe podcast the ride for nativity he can't

1442
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:13,720
am i remember there's a restaurant right there's like a counter service i got that written

1443
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:19,440
down so it's uh yeah there's no sit down but uh we got uh oh where is it oh we got the

1444
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:24,360
liberty in get yourself a hot dog there i feel like for a while they were trying foods

1445
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:29,280
from around the country so like you could get a maryland crab cake or a philly cheesesteak

1446
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:38,320
i see uh i don't know dirty water with that yeah oh god that's horrible oh uh in the ride

1447
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:45,240
itself let's not forget those uh i wrote down those dumbass statues oh yeah statues that

1448
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:50,960
light up where it's like a seaman a seafaring man who represents adventure and a doctor

1449
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,760
who represents compassion big aaron hug on the statues when it like like a curtain rises

1450
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,280
and the big reveal is there's been a bunch of statues over here i love yeah i love how

1451
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:04,320
much aaron hates this ride she really does she doesn't seem like she hates a lot of stuff

1452
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:09,940
but like her oh if she does yeah she she has there's no uh poker face on her when she loves

1453
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:14,220
something she loves what she hates it she despises it like i had to like my mom i had

1454
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:18,900
to like turn the day around after that how can i which i think probably it's easy in

1455
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:22,840
world showcase just go on that maelstrom again oh yeah just go just maelstrom for a couple

1456
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:27,380
hours and you're set there the attraction that made her the angriest it's a tie between

1457
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:33,120
american adventure and the armageddon experience in disney studios paris which was disney studios

1458
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:37,440
paris is just well at some point there will be the episode where i just rail against it

1459
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:42,680
it's uh yeah i thought they didn't think it's i think it's terrible and uh like the laziest

1460
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:48,080
park and we were just like run down by the place in general and then this armageddon

1461
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,920
show we came all the way to paris and here we are yeah that's that's what you're feeling

1462
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,400
at all times you're half an hour away from this this amazing city and we're here we're

1463
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:01,120
with a with this a planet hollywood and an earl of sandwich the place that we can just

1464
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:07,220
go yes avoid here that's our best restaurant option so uh armageddon uh yeah we'll get

1465
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:12,000
to that one um there's a gift shop next to the american adventure and you can buy all

1466
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,620
sorts of things you know any little american flags but here i have a picture from when

1467
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:27,120
we were there you can purchase a nice photo of our current president john old john trump

1468
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:31,400
it's two photos they have a couple i think they have older like they have clinton and

1469
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,400
stuff too but it's like it's a very cheap looking thing it looks like a black piece

1470
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,740
of construction paper where like a white border and then there's two photos one of him in

1471
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:44,680
front of the white house looking very dour like he usually does and then smiling to the

1472
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:49,160
point where he looks like he was photoshopped smiling it doesn't look like his real smile

1473
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:54,360
because he is uh he can't smile smiles are rare yeah that's like the school photos yes

1474
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:59,720
where it's me looking head on and then one of me turned very slightly in another direction

1475
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:04,040
scott if your dad had never intervened can you see a world where you would have bought

1476
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:09,700
that uh yeah i'm thinking about i'm thinking about like yeah there's possibly me

1477
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:15,280
at 32 i'm like no mike i hope that you're not planning on saying something about our

1478
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:22,320
president uh nothing but respect for my president yeah yeah yeah um except my dad's a big trump

1479
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:27,040
guy too so yeah yeah uh i i could have been right there with him uh do we add him to this

1480
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:31,280
too do we jam him into the american adventure just jump right from i think he deserves to

1481
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:36,580
be rosie the riveter just tried to trump and then that's it we missed the 60s donald trump

1482
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:43,400
coming down the escalator oh that's good yeah no jfk nothing okay well well you know an

1483
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:49,720
easy no martin lutheran no papers no cap links an easy place to drop him in right next to

1484
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:55,120
frederick douglas saying what a great guy he was that's continuing to do great work

1485
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:00,160
i have a better he okay it's mark twain it's ben franklin and trump hosting the thing oh

1486
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:05,320
great the three of them and then they can all comment and quip or or he's statler and

1487
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:10,880
waldorf up in the balcony uh railing and doing his screaming that he doesn't know these people

1488
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,760
he's never heard of them it's statler it's like it's one of it's statler and trump it's

1489
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:24,160
one of the muppets and trump every now and then trump animatronic like yells out like

1490
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,640
anna whit or wanted to be the british ambassador or it's like because he's not featured in

1491
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:36,600
the ride lincoln and trump in the balcony oh yeah sure theater and lincoln is well and

1492
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,320
trump knows what's about to happen because he's in on it or he just doesn't he's never

1493
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:45,320
learned that history oh that's true too he freaks out like the thing that's happened

1494
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:51,040
this is horrible but uh right away will expand the link in animatronics like this is the

1495
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,280
first time i've been in the balcony in a while but then will john and then like wilkes booth

1496
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,880
does it and trump is like wilkes booth is still a pretty good guy and i wish him well

1497
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,000
i think that he was a fantastic actor and i hope he acts again careful on that jump

1498
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,080
it's a long way down you're gonna hurt your leg again there's great people on both sides

1499
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:13,960
of this assassination hey both brothers i like both brothers why are you both brothers

1500
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:20,440
are great edwin come on come on here edwin um well well i mean maybe this takes us into

1501
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:25,520
into plus ups uh uh yeah changes anything we would do well yeah what are we are so you

1502
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:31,520
know the scale uh do we keep completely the same do we plus it up or do we burn it down

1503
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:37,240
for insurance money and build something else so who wants to well i think full assessment

1504
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:42,800
levity in the attraction i like this idea of wisecracks from the side i think i think

1505
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,880
yeah i think it is i respect so much about this attraction the technical achievement

1506
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:53,600
that it is in the great animatronics but why does it have to be so just self-important

1507
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:59,240
and heavy and ponderous and uh although i think i object to that those wisecracks are

1508
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:02,000
not going to be good no they're not going to be good i think this thing has to be more

1509
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,840
serious honestly i think that that should be more dour and more humorless i think they

1510
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:12,680
should take out the joke about how carnegie hall yeah yeah that's like the closest thing

1511
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:17,640
what does twain say then after that like libraries that's the ticket or he says when they're

1512
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:23,520
like who's this edison he's like oh that young fellow who invented the phonograph yeah yeah

1513
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,640
yeah yeah alexander grand bell's like clowning on edison right like yeah where he's like

1514
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,160
my telephone very billy zane and titanic sort of not knowing what will happen in comedy

1515
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:39,480
oh yes well he's a guy who thinks he's in his own golden age yeah i i actually thought

1516
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:43,560
i forgot that was the philadelphia exposition the centennial i thought it was the columbian

1517
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:50,440
exposition and to tie it back to a long ago episode uh columbian exposition setting of

1518
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:56,760
the devil in the white city twain went to that one uh saw the white city on the train

1519
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:01,720
ride in then got violently ill and never left his hotel room until he got on the train out

1520
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:10,440
so never saw the columbian exposition never got lured to hh homes's murder house um uh

1521
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:15,640
maybe for another podcast i went to the shanghai exposition years ago whoa i went to like a

1522
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:20,880
legit world expo that's wild things oh my god yeah it wasn't dubai it was the craziest

1523
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,160
thing i've ever seen what is that we should go to that do you buy one 2020 dubai you guys

1524
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:30,360
can save up yeah yeah we can go to blindsgate world they have things you walk through they're

1525
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:35,480
like walk through dark rides whoa it's so great we got what'd you see where any technology

1526
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:41,500
coming down the pike it was like 12-foot robot baby in one room um i went through a pavilion

1527
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:46,100
called the pavilion of urbanian which was i don't know what it meant but china had built

1528
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:49,880
it to teach its own citizens about like urban development wow it was like a dark ride it

1529
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,800
looked like it's a small world but you walk through it wow whoa this was not a bnol this

1530
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:01,180
was not like a no it's the expo the expo still exists and it moves it's usually every two

1531
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:06,000
years but it's in a different country every two years last year it was in kazakhstan wow

1532
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,800
yeah yeah yeah track track the expo guys we really should well we should it's as we know

1533
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:16,160
it's a part of theme park history yes 64 worlds fair disney built all this stuff yeah uh and

1534
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:21,880
epcot is a permanent world's fair it's still it's still very theme parky yeah yeah well

1535
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:25,800
that's good to hear okay they didn't just it's not just kind of a dry conference it's

1536
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,840
weird it's about exciting people you know huh jeez cool that's awesome um well yeah

1537
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:36,440
well i don't know what what do we do you think you can keep it i think well i'm ponderous

1538
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:41,000
more pondering i think more ponderous i think that it should be i i felt so bad for the

1539
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,740
guy who was saying that human being trying to tell everyone i think it should be more

1540
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:49,020
like a school like you get kicked out if you talk in there i think that it should be you

1541
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:53,520
really have to listen you have to this is a lesson in american history and that you

1542
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:59,940
should respect uh the history and the man and i think there should be no funny business

1543
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:06,240
when you when you walk into those doors jason thoughts uh i think you know i i watching

1544
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:13,320
this again and i i watched um uh the martin's vids on it uh we talked about this before

1545
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:18,760
it's the it makes these like documentary uh montages with like a lot of the concept art

1546
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:25,000
and then usually a ride through uh the one i watched of this uh included every version

1547
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,960
of the golden dreams ending uh which was a lot to watch back to back but uh watching

1548
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:39,760
it a couple times through regardless i do think it's strange it jumps from uh you know

1549
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,640
from the rosie the riveter to like we win the war and there's a video and then you're

1550
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:49,760
out uh after the torch so i would like just one or two more animatronic scenes in between

1551
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:57,360
the torch and the war like maybe someone walking on the moon uh maybe i don't know what else

1552
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:04,000
mlk uh-huh yeah maybe mlk like yeah that is strange they didn't have okay in there oh

1553
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,040
oh woodstock yeah disney-ified nixon nixon resigning well nixon getting on the helicopter

1554
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,240
because nixon climbing up the helicopter stairs i want more i just want more stairs in every

1555
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:19,840
single one of these oh yeah it's got to be history's greatest moments on stairs uh nixon

1556
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,640
what i now i had a different idea because nixon gave the i am not a crook speech in

1557
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:29,720

1560
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:45,280
rest of the basement of the contemporary hotel there's a picture of nixon and kissinger walking

01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:59,680
yeah there's a really crazy performance of a song called thousand points of light in

1564
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:07,160
one of these old specials sung by every president's automatic favorite singer lee greenwood uh

1565
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:11,320
trump strangely silent on the subject of lee greenwood until this year but i believe trump

1566
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:18,800
always loved lee greenwood his entire life always a fan uh but the uh yeah yeah maybe

1567
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:24,640
let's acknowledge disney world's part in history yes uh yeah bush is famous let's get robots

1568

1572
01:43:54,200 --> 01:44:01,320
thing like new history loves to do steve jobs in the uh in the garage inventing the computer

1573
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:06,200
the disney of fire yes and he's still he probably still talks in that franklin kind of way it's

1574
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:11,960
called a personal computer i believe everyone will have one of these in their pockets instead

1575
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:17,760
of listening to will rogers he's listening to like sam kennison or who would it be bill

hicks bill hicks yeah yeah yeah and then it goes to a bill hicks animatronic oh yeah we

1577
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:32,280
need some bill hicks in this giving the real stuff i got it from here chief joseph uh look

1578
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:38,360
this entire show has been bullshit okay uh yeah hey maybe that's that's not a bad thing you can

1579
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:44,840
get some uh get a bill marr in there oh yeah howard zinn uh uh the pooh is that the guy the

1580
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:51,240
people's history of the uh uh yeah let's get some dissenting voices yeah yeah another perspective

1581
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:58,040
yeah yeah fractured takes on history yeah um i don't know what else what do you have any thoughts

1582
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:04,520
about uh what do you the future of the american adventure burn it to the ground nobody's really

1583
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:09,880
said that yeah oh yeah just burn it to the ground we don't need it anymore hey sure yeah oh you do

1584
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:13,560
something now the american adventure is over yeah it's over acknowledge that we don't deserve it

1585
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:18,040
anymore it's like it's too optimistic burn it to the fucking ground and make kids watch it burn

1586
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:22,920
they're not gonna care it should be like an eternal flame it's just the thing is always

1587
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:29,320
that the building's always on fire all right film the animatronics faces melting as they scream

1588
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:38,360
this is what i get for being optimist right is an american pastime even those who overcame it

1589
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:48,360
so proud of their humility the flaming lasso lights uh it's on fire first and reaches his

1590
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:53,480
hands yeah this is the best version of the show is them all yeah but don't you got a jailbreak

1591
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:58,200
like the good guy you gotta get chief joseph out of there you gotta like let him run away laughing

1592
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:04,040
frederick douglas chief joseph and the the black guys in the garage all get out yeah they all get

1593
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:13,480
to piss oil onto the hydraulic fluid katie sand is that who it is the uh susan b anthony she gets

01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:29,000
she just goes up and she like mary boppins zoom out all the minorities and women escape and the

1596
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,360
white men burn but when where do where do they go do they go to other rides yeah they gotta get to

1597
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,880
other right they all just get their own boat on the melstrom they're in the mexico ride

1598
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:44,840
just confusing it just them and coke just waving at the end it's cocoa there now not yet there

1599
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:49,400
there's rumors depending on it doesn't look like it's gonna happen though oh really did it not do

1600
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:54,920
coco not do as well as they hoped it would do put it to justify putting in two robots yes right

1601
01:46:54,920 --> 01:47:01,400
they don't live in an apartment with some swedish they go to the they live in the uh the house in

1602
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:08,840
hollywood studios moms and dads they get waited on hand by a mom yeah but they but they're they

1603
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:13,560
like talk back a little like hey i'll eat how i want to eat i'll put my elbows where i want to

1604
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:17,960
i earned it i had to live in the american adventure yeah they teach mom a little something

1605
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:24,200
about tolerance yeah and maybe they get her out of the house and like like working again and

1606
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:30,520
pursuing her dreams that she is stifled to start meatloaf all day let's liberate those moms that

1607
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:36,040
is interesting that there was no like summer of love that the baby boomers who built this managed

1608
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:41,480
to restrain themselves from having a summer of love sequence in it oh yeah we're too close that's

1609
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:47,400
probably yeah civil rights anything yeah they didn't want to put controversial stuff in there

1610
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:53,320
jason you know they didn't want to rile the average audience you know what i think if you're

1611
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:58,040
okay well we'll still burn it down but before we do let's just add one section for the last year

1612
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:03,640
which is get uh franklin and twain off of the torch and let's put hendrix on their whale and

1613
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:09,800
the star-spangled banner oh yeah up on the shelf next to the flame next to his friend charles manson

1614
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,600
i guess he hadn't been caught yet by the time they started blue skying this ride

1615
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,240
all horrified like all right let's not work any overtime it's still a

1616
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:27,800
we might die benjamin franklin the first animatronic to climb upstairs charles

1617
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:34,920
manson the first animatronic to paint in blood on a wall hell ter it goes right from

1618
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:42,520
like uh like from uh rose of the river due to the la bianca murder the final you watch the final stabs

1619
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:48,200
and then like all right it's done well let's now we just wait for that race war to happen

1620
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:57,880
any minute now these are jokes but these this is the american adventure that is true it has all the

1621
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:04,040
parts yeah that's all part of this there's no like yeah there's no uh uh warren bd hitting on

1622
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:12,760
mia ferro at the ground derby yeah patty hearst yeah patty hearst woody allen exiting a lobby with

1623
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:27,720
suny the boat the robert wagner boat scene this is the american adventure this is what it is

1624
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:34,600
the low speed oj simpson chase yes this brought us together as a nation an cubicle jockey from

1625
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:40,520
enron just going what do you mean my pension is worthless now the sex flame the trump and clinton

1626
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:47,960
were both on yeah jeffrey ephes sex plane yeah and the sex island although i guess that's up

1627
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,400
that's the sky is international sky so maybe that's not american adventure

1628
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:57,240
spreading their golden wings it was those guys that's true what's her name though florida the

1629
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:03,400
four catherine harris catherine aris holding up a hanging chad yeah for this update we built the

1630
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:10,520
we built the biggest hanging chad that's ever been constructed michael jackson dangles blanket out of

1631
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:17,160
a window oh that would be the new shaking hands moment on the ride that would be the true climax

1632
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:25,800
the cast and crew of a master of disguise learning about 9 11. did that happen yeah they were on the

1633
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:31,640
set their imdb page yeah there's a moment of silence they were filming the turtle club scene

1634
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:39,640
it was literally the turtle scene i think so we came up on a doe voice podcast oh really okay so

1635
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:47,720
uh so dana carvey in turtle costume in sadness about 9 11 descending into the suit uh and then

1636
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:54,760
descending back into the floor uh yeah yeah hey i like this uh so we do all those and then we burn

1637
01:50:54,760 --> 01:51:00,840
it to the ground yeah last year just like guns blazing they give us the keys let's just give us

1638
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:06,680
just give us the keys and endless animatronic money uh uh do we keep go i think is it just

1639
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:12,840
regular golden dreams or do you do anything yeah they make it even longer every year it gets

1640
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:17,400
aggressively longer and any animatronics we couldn't add go into the golden dreams like montage

1641
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:25,080
yeah and lee greenwood uh does a verse now they had a lee greenwood verse up to it and uh and uh

1642
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:34,440
uh what what's the uh three doors down they're in the air yeah uh they rip a solo um uh they're

1643
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:39,880
in a house band they're just there always it's the re-a they aren't real three doors down oh also

1644
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,680
of course in the montage we didn't even mention of course waltz in the film montage yeah and waltz

1645
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:49,320
is also in the lobby of the hall of presidents now like there's a little corner to like here

1646
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:53,880
and there's some waltz stuff and it's like yeah you got a waltz and he wasn't a president but uh

1647
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:58,280
yeah let's put him in the lobby basically yeah he was a president they also have elon musk who

1648
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:05,320
certainly has done all of his work in america but was did not live in america until 18 or so

1649
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,680
so i don't know look i'm not a my i i this that's not the argument to make that somebody's not

1650
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:15,560
american for but like i don't know is that weird i think it's a little premature to put elon musk

1651
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:23,800
yeah yeah villain they might have to burn this place yeah there you go he starts the fire with

1652
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:30,200
the we build an elon musk animatronic just peter theil light the fire together if being weird and

1653
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,680
shitty disqualifies you from being in a disney park then there's plenty of people that need to

1654
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:38,680
get kicked out so i'm not gonna i'm gonna say elon musk belongs there already no matter what

1655
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:45,960
he's about to do because walt disney's there uh well we no don't say that about waltz we will joke

1656
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:52,520
about anything except for waltz you're a man a perfect yeah he was great no you're upsetting
