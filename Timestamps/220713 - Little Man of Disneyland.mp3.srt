1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,560
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate, where today we're saying faith in begora, Patrick

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,960
begora that is. I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson. I am here. Is there a way we

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,560
could have your name be like Jason begora? Like a new moniker? I could certainly add it to the list,

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,520
Scott Gardner. You've been given a lot of odd nicknames. Yeah, no, I know. I think the way is

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,920
by saying it. He is today. He's Jason begora today. Uh huh. Yeah, would you would do you like it?

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,920
I like it. Okay, well, it doesn't sound like you're that into it. So never mind.

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,840
Well, I looked this up, just just to be certain. Begora is a euphemism for the phrase by God.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,360
Sometimes you hear it in the phrase of faith in begora, which is the Irish equivalent of an

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,240
American saying by golly or by gosh. By gosh. Begora, of course, I know there's one place I've

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,560
heard it the most. I'm pretty sure. And you guys know what I'm talking about? No. Well, it was,

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,560
it's said on the Batman 60s show by the not Commissioner Gordon, but the other guy,

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,080
the other guy. Yes. His name O'Hara, Chief O'Hara. Yes. He says, Oh, but gore a lot.

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,640
And then sometimes bad, at least once Batman said begora because I just saw it. There's a Instagram

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,560
account I followed. It's just Batman 66 clips and pictures. And Batman ends one of these clips by

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:56,160
saying begora. It's a wonderful, stiff, and a very neat. Okay. So we're so that's the cultural

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:03,840
significance of that for me. Yeah. For us, I guess it's involved. It's of course, Patrick begora,

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,040
the little man of Disneyland, little man of Disneyland. This is one of those. I think I

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,760
learned about this within an episode. I didn't know about it, but I don't know why it came up

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,400
before, but this was news to me, but kind of delightful to learn more about. Yeah. I,

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,960
well, I had to go back and I pieced together how I first heard of it, which was only a few years ago.

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,280
But I do want to shout out. Thank you to Roxy Cohen and Taylor Haney, Tyler Haney, who recently

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,160
suggested this topic and a pretty, pretty good timing with how he came up for us. So now they

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,520
suggested it. So here we are, but it is, you mean because they suggested and now we're doing it.

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,920
Is there more to the time? I think it came up naturally on an episode. And then I saw these

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
mentioned in the comments. You were smiling though, in a way that made me think, well, it's pretty

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,880
good timing because by the way, I have the character in my pocket. Here he is. Like it was

28
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,160
something like you had a little secret. I was smiling more because I was proud of myself that I

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,680
wrote down, don't forget to say this at the top. And I didn't forget to say that. You were proud

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,160
of yourself. I was just proud of myself for doing the bare minimum. You were smiling so wide.

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, I'm doing it. You're beaming. I said to say the names. I don't know how I'm saying the names.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,520
I mean, this is a delightful topic. I mean, I agree. I am tickled by all of this. So the little man

33
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:35,440
of Disneyland, if you don't know, kind of started in 1955. There was a, oh God, what is it called?

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,040
Little golden book. Little golden book. Little golden book. Yeah. Why is it? It's the little man

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,480
of Disney. Oh, you're right. The little man of Disney. Yeah. Okay. Keeping those tees, gang.

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:53,440
And eventually they put in a tiny little door in Adventureland as like a little Easter egg

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:01,600
was removed for a while. But then in 2015, they went all in on the little man of Disneyland.

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,240
Now, yeah, they went all in. Now, correct me if I'm wrong. Did I not learn about this from John

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,480
Lasseter? I think I learned this from John Lasseter. Not personally, not one. I believe he was

40
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,600
involved in the presentation at D23. Yeah. There was a big coordinated efforts to bring this

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,760
bit of old mythology back in 2015. Okay. Yeah. They re-released the book in 2015. And I think

42
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,840
at least for the initial release, you can only get this at the publisher's booth at the D23 event.

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,080
And now it's kind of available everywhere. Okay. I borrowed a Kindle copy from the LA library. That's

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,120
how I got ahold of it. Oh, nice. Okay. Well, there we go. We got an easy way for everybody to

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,920
experience this story and follow along with us. We're not going to read it to you, but we'll go

46
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,880
through it. But maybe for another Patreon tier, Jason should read it to you. Oh, Jason's Tuck-ins.

47
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Would you do a Club 3 exclusive reading to the listener? Oh, it's not a long book. Of different

48
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,000
voices and stuff? Well, now you're giving yourself more work. I'm all for it. But just at least one.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,840
If I'm going all in, I'll go all in. Read the book and then I will put under it the baby

50
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
Aerosmith song, Don't Want to Miss a Thing. Like the lullaby, I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,640
which is not the first time I've put that music under you. You mean from those bad Spotify albums

52
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,480
where they just kind of midi style turn? It's Jason Reed's Little Man of Disneyland to Your Sleep.

53
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,520
That's going to be, we're going to do this. This is easy. Let's put in the next round of voting.

54
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,240
No votes. We're doing it. They get it. Oh, people. Okay. All right. They're getting it.

55
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,360
That's a bonus. That's not an official. That's just a bonus. That's a bonus. That's a bonus.

56
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll do that. You can do that. Why is it Aerosmith? Why are they the lullaby? Because I have the file

57
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,760
on my desktop. Because I don't want to rip a new file. Yeah. Well, but that's Club 3. So I guess

58
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,360
that's an exclusive item. Okay. Well, Donald appears in the books. You're going to have to do

59
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,160
some Donald dialogue. What did Jason, what he wants to do with the voice. I'm not going to edit

60
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,800
him at all. Well, that's a funny thing. I mean, that's a big thing I have to say about the book,

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:27,040
which is that there's no, I mean, it's cute. It's very funny, but there's not really an attempt,

62
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:35,120
I feel like, to make the characters like there's, it's not spelled phonetically. Like when Donald

63
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,560
talks, Goofy talks, it just sounds like guys. Yeah. They're just like humans. Yeah. Yeah. They're

64
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,960
just like humans. Like I'm just going to read a passage because this is how I heard it in my head.

65
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,640
Who are we? Cried Donald Duck. Don't you go to the movies? Don't you watch TV? Don't you read books

66
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,480
or newspapers? Don't you know Goofy and Pluto? Don't you know Donald Duck? No, said Patrick.

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,600
And he blew a smoke ring right in Donald's face. Good. Good for after that, after that entitled

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,880
rant. Yeah. So angry. Yeah. Much deserved. When I read it, I think I will try to do a voice

69
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,840
for Patrick, but not for anyone else. Cause everyone else is just like, yeah, man, we got

70
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,640
this construction project we're doing. Okay. Can I give you one more? I think don't even think about

71
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,840
it. Don't attempt. Don't try it ahead of time. Oh no. Good. And only one, only one take. One take

72
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,640
of the whole book. Yes. No, no edits. There's a lot of pressure. No, no pressure at all. You're free.

73
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
We're just going to do it or we'll do it live. We'll do it next time we record. Okay.

74
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,840
Jason, now Jason's clam that now you're worried about doing it at home. Yeah, I don't care.

75
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,880
But how are you going to know that he's not, he might be slipping other takes in there.

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,160
I'll know. You need to be watching. I'll know if you don't know. It'll be a separate file

77
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,760
unless he's editing it and then putting it back on the memory card.

78
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Which I don't think he's going to do. Yeah. He'd have to like reassemble what a raw file

79
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,960
would look like. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So there's no way. Okay. So you'll have a, there's a fail safe.

80
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,480
My memory of this is around 2015 because there was a Disney parks blog post explaining

81
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
what this was and to keep an eye out for it at adventure land.

82
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,840
And there, the May, 2010s, I feel like at Disneyland, they redid California adventure in

83
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:44,000
2012 and then they coasted on that for a while. And so there would be little things like, oh,

84
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,840
there's a little theater show next to the castle now and there's Maurice's treats. And I, I feel

85
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,400
like I would get excited. I was like, oh, there's something new. And I would go down and he like,

86
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,840
well, this is kind of a nothing, but I remember it's 2015 reading about the little man of Disneyland

87
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,880
and looking up more what it meant. And I was like, okay, next time I get to that park,

88
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,480
I got to find this tiny door. This felt like enough to you. This is okay. We had cars land

89
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,920
and now we have a little door in the bottom of a tree, a little door and a little window and a

90
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,040
little smoke stack. Yep. Yep. And that's what we got. That's what this is about. So there's a book

91
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,040
about it's a leprechaun, just to say a book about a leprechaun who lives at Disneyland.

92
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,360
And then, and then there's a little bit of drama that happens, but there's an agreement that he

93
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,240
will continue to live at Disneyland. And now you can go to Disneyland and see his little door and

94
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
his little smoke stack and his window. Does that all, I mean, I get all three of the things. Yeah.

95
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,560
Okay. Yeah. He lived in an orange tree. He lived in like the orange groves and when they were

96
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,720
gutting it, when, when the character, the characters also being pretty hands-on with the construction

97
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,360
of Disneyland. Yeah. They're building the park. Which is what I obviously like to see. Yeah. That's

98
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,240
in line with that. They continue to this day to do all of the cleaning and manual labor, getting it

99
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
visitor ready. They, you know, in, in Cannes and Joe Rody had nothing to do with the guardians overlay.

100
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,960
It was a series of tunes who were conceiving of a new ride version of the ride and building it.

101
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,880
Who had to go meet with the people at the elevator company. Right. Figure out different,

102
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,400
you know, patterns that the, that the elevate. So the characters have to know a lot about

103
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,960
physics and engineering. Yeah. Yeah. Everything. The characters, they really, cause how many like

104
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,480
areas do you have to be an expert in to be an Imagineer? Many. Yeah. So they have the

105
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,760
Disney characters in addition to being fun and funny also know everything. Who would be a,

106
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,160
a dis of all the tunes who would be like lead Imagineer, like Ludwig von Drake or gyro gear loose?

107
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,120
Yeah, I would think you would want at least in a ceremony, at least in an oversight, like,

108
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,480
you know, top of the chain. But like, yeah, like are there any other like good with plan

109
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,840
drawing a plan type? I mean, both gyro and Ludwig kind of screwed things up a lot. Yeah.

110
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:19,200
Um, the, uh, the Etch A Sketch from Toy Story has the ability to produce a, you know, geometrically

111
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,360
right. Yeah. Like fine points diagram out of it. So maybe he's not leading it up, but you want

112
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
Etch A Sketch around, right? Cause he's a, he's a supercomputer essentially. The Etch A Sketch and

113
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,880
horse horse collar are, uh, you know, they're the ones really burning the midnight oil. Yeah. Right.

114
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,920
Horace is the kind of the public facing. He's like, he deals with the people in the management.

115
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Ludwig or gyro might be like taking the two hour lunches or like,

116
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,520
Oh, I, they, I'm out at five every day. Sometimes four or three, you know,

117
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,440
they rest on their laurels or they're a little lazy. Yeah. Well, somebody needs to do this.

118
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,800
Somebody needs to show this version of, of Canon where the tunes are designing rides. Yeah. And

119
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,000
where all the character, one thing I like about kind of tune Canon and tune town and all that

120
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,560
is that it implies that all of the characters that ever were and ever will be exist already.

121
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,200
And they, maybe they just haven't been cast in a movie. Oh, I see. Yeah. Cause I think in Roger

122
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,360
Rabbit, there are characters around, even though they're in the year that that movie is set,

123
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,280
they have not, their movie isn't out yet. I can't name who those are. I forget if like Dumbo wasn't

124
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:40,640
out. Um, but that's the, you know, so like, uh, Mirabelle from Encanto has been living in tune

125
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,440
town. Oh wow. And just waiting for a big break for 80 and just like, please cast me. And it took,

126
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,040
it just took that long. I had to rely. I relate to that. I relate to that hard. Any actor. Yeah.

127
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,040
The algorithms just feeding you annoying things of like, you know, uh, so and so really didn't get

128
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,880
their first big break until they were 45, you know, they were doing bit parts for years.

129
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,920
But they, at a certain point, these annoying me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She auditioned for like to be

130
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,400
in the background of wind in the willows. Didn't work. Yeah. So there's, so there's characters who

131
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,160
are around who won't be in a movie for still decades to come. Well, cause yeah, they're immortal

132
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,200
too. So yeah, for all the tunes that exist now are the only tunes that will ever exist. It's like,

133
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,720
um, energy. Let's say all the energy is it exists already. Yeah. Go away. Yeah. Yeah. It's just there

134
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,600
and it moves around. It's a little creepy in a way. All the characters are like, they're really,

135
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,960
just to put it in another simple way, they're all bicentennial men. Right.

136
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,720
They're all like Robin Williams, the robot who lives, who outlives his

137
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,080
owners many times over. Right. So that's the rules of tunes. Yeah. And I guess the rules of the little

138
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,320
man of. Oh yeah. You would have to be, you would have had to be hanging out. Maybe that's not

139
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,040
correct though, because there's something weird about like he, is it in the book that he like

140
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,480
outlives all his people? Isn't that in it? He's the last one. Yeah. He's the last one. It also shows up

141
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,360
not a lot of Patrick Bagura appearances in other things, except that Tales of Adventureland,

142
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:30,240
YA adventure series. Oh that, yeah. I know that. It came up wearing the sea stuff because like we're

143
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,480
trying to dig, trying to like ring the washcloth of like, where are the sea mentions? Where are the

144
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,400
cannon like mentions and this Tales of Adventureland? It's like, okay, the robot shows up there,

145
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,600
but does the robot in the sea? Like, you know, that sort of thing. What was the last thing you said?

146
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:55,760
Does the robot inging sing? I said the robot is like in the book, but is he there? Is he in sea?

147
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, okay. Is he in sea? Okay. Yeah. What robot though? I don't know. I'm just using that as an example.

148
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,880
Someone made like a steam punk robot, I feel like. Are you thinking of Dr. Tootsom? I'm not thinking

149
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:19,520
of Dr. Tootsom and his grotesque creations. The only thing, the only hope right now is that the

150
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,960
smokestacks are rising above our city walk, over City Walk Hollywood. The guitar is gone. The guitar

151
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,280
is rising in its place. So the famous Toothsome Emporium smokestacks. It's a great, we don't,

152
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,680
look, I don't think we're happy about the Olympics in LA, but this is, this is what could, this is the

153
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,040
torch of hope for Los Angeles. It's the only thing I'm holding out hope for. Yeah. Yeah. I've been

154
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,240
there a couple of times at like one in the morning. Like I've gone to the last showing at the movie

155
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,760
theater for like a couple movies and at 12, 30 AM, one in the morning, there is like a dozen people

156
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,800
and that thing is fully lit up with work lights. And they are like, working on it. I think there were

157
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,120
people waiting for it still. Like waiting for it to open. Oh no, banging on it. Praying, holding a vigil,

158
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,280
like the steampunk chocolate plates will be open. People on the top of the building.

159
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,440
I have been thinking about City Walk. I've been thinking since the Tim Kelpaca

160
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,840
episode, I've been thinking about Womp Hoppers every day. Yeah. Oh, good, good. Yeah. I apologize.

161
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm so, I feel bad for Womp Hopper that we forgot him. We forgot the name Womp Hopper. I knew it was

162
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,080
a wagon thing. Wagon works. Wagon wheel. Wagon works. I believe wagon works. Okay. So it's a step

163
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,480
back in that direction that there is a character who only lives at City Walk. He's got a big sizable

164
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,120
campus up there. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. Womp Hoppers. It's also funny to me, I had the recent,

165
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:55,040
we got out of a movie at 9.45 at City Walk. It's really funny that like, oh, so you want to get a

166
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,320
drink? Uh oh. Like, just no, like who would, why should we have like a bar open at the, anywhere

167
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,560
at this place at 10 o'clock? Are you a maniac? It used to be, yes, because we would go to a movie

168
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,720
and this was years ago already at this point, I guess, because it was maybe Age of Ultron,

169
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,800
which is eight years ago, seven years ago. Yeah. And the only place to go was Howl at the Moon

170
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,800
or Saddle Ranch. All gone. After 10 or 11. Yeah. And now it's, yeah, there's nothing. Yeah. It's

171
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,280
gotta be a weekend and then you get midnight if you're lucky. This is a revenue stream we can do

172
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,120
without. We don't want a bunch of luscious vomiting on our dancing fountains. And it's not

173
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,960
Orlando. Just, you know, act with people late. Right. Orlando is a party spot and City Walk,

174
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,080
Hollywood, they do not want partying. They got Howl at the Moon. That was the nail in the coffin.

175
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah. That was, remember the, the weird thing where a security guy at Howl at the Moon had to carry

176
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,440
your drink six feet between the entrance. Do I remember that? What do you mean? That's a vivid,

177
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,040
one of the crucial memories of our lives. We brought that up a few times. I don't know,

178
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,560
at the last few years, who remembers anything? But that was still so strange to me. Well, yeah,

179
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,800
because yeah, basically, if you don't know what we're talking about, there's a section where you

180
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,760
can drink on a balcony at Howl at the Moon, which is on the third, the third floor, I think. Yeah,

181
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,680
right? Yeah. Of City Loft. In City Loft. Where the bars are. So there's the inside of Howl at the

182
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,600
Moon and then there's a little balcony area. But to get to the balcony area, you have to cross

183
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,200
the sidewalk and now you're not, it's, it's not legal to drink on that sidewalk or hold an

184
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,960
alcoholic beverage. Yeah. So a person, an employee has to surf your beverage from the, from the

185
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
inside of the bar to the balcony area, and then you can take it again. A licensed beverage holder.

186
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,960
Yes. To walk at three feet. And maybe that's why it closed. Maybe that was too expensive to hire

187
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,480
a person to surf your beverage. Well, just the training that they have to pay for. Well, of

188
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,680
course. To put them in simulators and they don't let them do it with real alcohol. They put like

189
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,840
sugar water in it that simulates the weight of alcohol. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So surf is probably

190
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,040
like the industry term for it. That makes it sound more real. Sounds cool. But I did go to a fancy

191
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,200
restaurant once where like, oh, your table is ready. And we were at the bar and they like put

192
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,120
like two wine glasses on a little stone slate and they carried that. I think, I think this guy came

193
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,520
up on the episode. We talked about it. Everything that we've just said the last five minutes. Again,

194
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
this is why I've brought up the five timers club. I think that we are like inducting members into

195
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
the five timers club every episode. And we don't even know. By that I mean stories that we've told.

196
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
These stories have been told. I'm saying that there's other stories that we're not even aware

197
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,520
of where I'm like, I'm telling this fresh anecdote for the first time. This definitely came out

198
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,600
because it's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen in a restaurant. And I'm sure in fine dining,

199
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,960
it's kind of standard. Yeah. But it was still very strange that they keep like, and this is where we

200
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,480
keep the little stack of slate that we use to serve beverages. Yeah. Sure. 10 feet to a two top.

201
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,920
Now that I don't know if we named it surfing. That could be. But who knows? Yeah. Well,

202
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,320
we were so blacked out on blue curacao in that episode. Oh yeah. Let's get from blue to green.

203
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,840
Let's head over to, let's get back. Let's get to the luck of the Irish.

204
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,040
So let's see other big moments that I feel like we should mention. It's kind of established early

205
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,240
on. So yeah, Patrick lives in a little tree. They're gutting the orchard. They're gutting it all.

206
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,080
We might need to explain this from the ground up a little bit. Like the, so yes,

207
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,240
Patrick is the last leprechaun. Right. His people have been, I don't know what.

208
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,080
Let your imagination run wild with what that means. Cause they're magical creatures.

209
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,480
I've buried 700 friends. Yeah. Or heat killed them all. Maybe he didn't want competition.

210
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,280
In the final book in the Tales from Adventureland series titled the doomsday device,

211
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,000
Patrick Magora guards the eternal tree. An enchanted date palm also referred to as the

212
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,120
Dominguez palm, which is a reference to the, uh, what did they say? The oldest actual tree

213
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,680
Disneyland. And that was part of the fine print is like, you have to keep this tree.

214
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Walt, you can have this land. The original owners of the land. The original owners was like, you

215
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,640
have to keep this alive. And the Dominguez palm is still in Adventureland. It's moved once or twice.

216
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Over the years, this stuff got built up more. So all the famous, all the notable trees of the

217
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,840
existing land owners, fictional or otherwise are in Adventureland. So basically if you read this

218
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,240
book, the Easter egg has a second Easter egg inside of it. Uh, it's like those Cadbury that

219
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,080
they had to take the toys out of. I like that I go to Rustin Russian nesting done. You go to

220
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,360
treats with prizes. Cadbury eggs had toys in them? No, those, uh, sorry, uh, kinder balls, uh,

221
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,680
kinder like, yeah, I know, I know. So now the toy is in the box next to the egg, not inside the

222
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,480
hollow egg. You don't have to shop through to get to the toy. But yeah, so this, so it's a leprechaun

223
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:27,040
who lived in an Anaheim orange Grove before Disneyland was built or being considered to be

224
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,160
built. Yeah. And he is like a tiny leprechaun and dressed like you are imagining. He smokes a pipe,

225
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:42,240
smokes a pipe on like every page and yeah, he blasts a smoke ring at Donald. So funny. Yeah.

226
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,280
So now we have some dueling mythologies, which is that we've, cause we discussed that toon town

227
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,800
origin story where the tunes already live toon town existed before Disneyland. And then they said

228
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,960
to Walt, Hey, why don't you build in our backyard? So there's that where the eternal tunes. So why

229
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,760
not use this orange group? Nobody lives there. What they didn't know is a leprechaun lived there.

230
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,040
So separate things way up at the top of the property tunes. Then this leprechaun living in

231
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,760
a single, a leprechaun living in a citrus tree as you do, right. That adds up to me. Um, and,

232
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,400
but then there's a bunch of like construction hubbub. He goes outside. What's all this racket upset

233
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,720
about it. Yeah. And, uh, yeah, Donald's kind of fresh to him and he gets a smoke ring in the face.

234
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,000
Donald kind of doubles down and then Patrick like blasts his ass with magic.

235
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,200
It's established that Patrick has powers, right? Yeah. But it's kind of like, it's the, the, the,

236
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,480
like the Twilight Zone with the kid who controls the town where it's like, you only see the powers

237
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,000
in action a little bit. He, um, yeah, he, he shatters Donald shovel. Is that correct? Yes.

238
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,400
Just like, and he puts him, knocks him right on his seat. You could destroy matter. Yeah. Which

239
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,720
is pretty scary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, this guy's somebody to be reckoned with. They could,

240
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,600
it's a good thing they ran into him at this point and not further into the construction

241
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,400
because they could have had the castle fully built ready to go. Right. And he shatters it with his

242
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,320
mind. Yeah. That would have been scary. Shit. Yeah. That's a book. Now, honestly, in, in, in,

243
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,520
you know, cause he's living in Disneyland, he could still do it at any moment. Oh yeah. If he,

244
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,800
if he changes his mind or doesn't like the way like you're, you're playing with like a dark

245
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,400
Phoenix level of power here. Yeah. This definitely an Omega mutant kind of thing. Like high class

246
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,640
X-Men level mutant powers displaying here. Black Tom Cassidy, Proteus, Moira, Moira McTaggart's,

247
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,960
son. Yeah. All of them. Yeah. All of them. Another fine Irish reality warper, Patrick Magora,

248
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,320
Proteus. Yeah. Yeah. Proteus. Yeah. So he could, I guess for more current reference, he could do

249
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,840
the snap at any moment. He could. That one I know. It's like he has the power of the Infinity Gauntlet.

250
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,000
The Infinity Gauntlet. The reality stone. That's the luck of the Irish baby. That's how powerful it is.

251
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,440
What's the reality stone? You can change reality. Yeah. There's like different, there's a Time

252
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,240
Stone. There's a Reality Stone. Those are all the different things. Yeah. The color. Yeah. The gauntlet.

253
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,320
That's right. Okay. So yeah, this guy's, don't mess with this guy. Yeah. Yeah. And then Mickey

254
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,040
comes in down by going like, hold on, hold on. We'll show you the plants. Let's all get in a

255
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:43,040
helicopter. That is so great. Mickey Mouse tells a three inch tall leprechaun. It's like, all right,

256
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,600
we understand your concerns. We need to get in a helicopter. And we'll explain everything.

257
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,200
Which the D23 article noted about this all coming back noted that's actually how Walt would go from

258
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,440
the Burbank Studios down to Anaheim. He would ride a helicopter. Well, it's also what he would

259
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,080
do. I mean, this is like, okay, so this is a scenario where we want to build something on

260
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,240
this land, but there's people on or near the land who don't want our thing built. So what do we do?

261
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,160
Well, once we explain what it is we're doing, it's going to be fun. This is really, it really is like

262
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,840
an instructional playbook. Maybe it was written for those reasons to like, okay, so in the future,

263
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,680
you're ever trying to build near a Civil War battlefield. Here is the need to get in there,

264
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,800
talk to the locals, convince that look, this is going to be good for your like, you might,

265
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,400
hey, you might end up with a job. Hey, Patrick, there's plenty you can do. You can go, you're

266
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,120
very small. You can scrub all our pipes with a little brush. You can be the busiest little

267
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,960
plumber in all of Disneyland. That's exactly right. Except I think Walt would have been like,

268
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Civil War battlefield. No way. Keep that. Keep that as is. Oh, that's true. He may have not liked

269
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,560
that. But anything else, Native American reservation here, guys, let me show you what we're doing.

270
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:09,680
We'll make your land better. Yeah. Everything else. Yeah. Swan planned. Swan. Well, we need

271
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,000
to build a bunch of stuff. Arm around the gators. Don't destroy the ecosystem too much, but you can

272
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,800
destroy it a little. Dredge it a little. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it's not shock and awe

273
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,760
because he's not hurting them, but it is just, it's, it's, it's awe. How about it's only awe?

274
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,440
It's only awe. You did, it sounds not good what I'm doing. And then I bought all this property

275
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,800
shady way from underneath you essentially to keep the values down. But when you see like there's,

276
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,440
you're going to get to ride around in an elephant. Now are you impressed? And in Patrick's case,

277
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,560
absolutely. He kind of just looks over the plans and got it. Cool. No, I'm, you know what, now that

278
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,560
I see, now that I see what you're doing and the kind of joy you're going to bring, I sign off 100%.

279
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,760
Now I get it. Yeah. He eats, he's like a rocket to the moon. Like this is incredible. Like everything

280
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,920
he's kind of overwhelmed. The, there is a, a fun page where like Mickey and Goofy and Patrick

281
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,560
are looking at concept art, which is based apparently on actual concept art. And the,

282
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:20,800
I have some names, the illustrator, the actual illustrator of the book, Dick Kelsey,

283
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,400
adapted the concept art and he was a real, like he was on staff at Disney. He joined Disney in

284
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,480
1940, worked as an animator, art director and writer, worked on Pinocchio, Fantasia,

285
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
and Alice in Wonderland. And then the, the writer of the Little Man from Disneyland book

286
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:52,720
was a Golden writer, Jan Warner. She wrote under the name Annie North Bedford.

287
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,240
Annie North Bedford. Yeah. The address of the little Golden Books headquarters was on,

288
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,320
it was on North Bedford Avenue. Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills. Yeah. So a pen name,

289
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,120
and she wrote like 400 little Golden Books. By the way, little Golden Books are very nice. These

290
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,280
exist in my parent ecosystem. They still do them. They do them for new movies. We just got one of

291
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Budsatopia. It's like, I feel a nice comfort wash over me when I see that gold stripe on the side

292
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,720
of, cause it's not only my childhood, but I could sense that I could sense that coming from my mom's

293
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,200
childhood. And maybe before that, I don't remember, I don't know when Golden Books started,

294
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,800
but there's a, I don't know. I let, you know what? I'm just going to, I'm going to give that stripe

295
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,720
a little swipe next to it. Just kind of like wipe my thumb down that and see how nice I feel after.

296
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah. As a kid, that's what I, I mean, I remember the books, but I remember the spine.

297
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:57,600
I remember that. I'm like, Ooh, yeah. Look at that golden spine. Like, yeah, let's just like,

298
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,080
let's just take those spines. What if the book was just the spine? What was all spine?

299
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,840
You know, that's a little, I think there's a little smoking a cigarette feel to just like

300
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,120
foop, just run in your hands and that thing. It's, I'm just going to get a lot of golden book spines.

301
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,720
I'm going to de-spine all the golden books. That is some like adult, like relaxation technique.

302
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Like put a big golden spine on a door in your house and then just rub it when you're feeling

303
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,920
stressed. It's a great fidget spinner. We just invented a fidget spinner. If you can make your

304
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:36,160
door into a big golden book, then you can rub the spine when life is getting you down.

305
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,320
Try it. All right. Cool. Well, I'm going to start, then I'll start stripping them with their spines

306
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,080
and throwing the rest of the books away. Yeah. The book gives a shit corporate trash, but that spine.

307
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah, that's good. That's good. That's comforting. I think it's kind of funny also that this is a,

308
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,600
with the magic involved here, Mickey Mouse meets a leprechaun and then what happens?

309
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,200
We put them on a helicopter and take them to look at some blueprints.

310
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:13,120
There's a really fun mix in this story of magic and practical. Yeah. Yeah. But also, but you know,

311
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:21,040
it's magical in its own way for a leprechaun to get to see a helicopter. I mean, it's so huge to

312
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,680
him. He could live his life in it. He's, but this could book could have gone a different way where

313
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,160
can this be my home now? Yeah. Is there, does the leprechaun in the movie, the horror movies,

314
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,920
the leprechaun, does he ever go on a helicopter? I don't think so. Hmm. I'm not a hundred percent

315
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,160
on that either way. Has anyone watched any of the leprechaun movies? I haven't. I was too scared as

316
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,000
a kid. You've never seen any of them? No. No. Even like clips? Not really. Leprechaun in the hood?

317
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,400
I'm aware of it. Don't know anything. Have you ever seen a clip of a leprechaun smoke a bong?

318
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,120
No, he does. Oh, that's great. Well, you've got to watch leprechaun in the hood at least.

319
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,600
Look, haven't seen that part, but that's, you know, if we're comparing leprechaun media,

320
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,080
that's pretty exciting. Yeah. So, so I've only seen, I have not seen all, I'm not a big leprechaun.

321
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,400
I've seen like the first one and I've seen leprechaun in the hood. And then there's another,

322
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,960
I forget what the one before that maybe I'm not seeing the greatest movies. I'm just wondering,

323
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,680
like, is there precedent for a leprechaun in a helicopter? Because they get sillier as they go.

324
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,320
So I wonder if there was any, like he was on a sightseeing tour or he was well, he doesn't,

325
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,960
he doesn't smoke a bong and then operate a helicopter, does he? I hope not. Dangerous

326
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,720
for himself in it. I'm concerned about him. I know he is a bloodthirsty leprechaun. Yeah. He's

327
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,960
an evil. I don't want him to hurt himself. He is not like Patrick Begora. No, Patrick doesn't,

328
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,120
besides like giving Donald a little ouchy. He doesn't really do anything. Deserves it. This is

329
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,160
not a good situation that they are just tearing up his, that Mickey at least is, you know,

330
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:00,400
he, he tries to be a mediator, right? But Donald is just like, this is a pest. We have a plan here.

331
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:08,240
We're going to build a 1800s America in your, and we, I don't care if you lived here, get the

332
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,760
fuck out. It's such a funny thing though, cause, cause the way you would want to present Disneyland,

333
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,600
I feel like in the fantastical way is that this stuff is here. You're just there. So when you see

334
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,520
it presented in a way that literally they have to dig holes in the middle of a thing that already

335
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,640
exists is funny to me. Donald Duck himself has to go in there with a shovel. But, but like the

336
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,320
distinction being like the way Disneyland is presented is like not that this is fake. It is

337
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,560
real. This is actually a real main street that was just built because there was a necessity.

338
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:46,560
There was a necessity to build the guardians, whatever, all that stuff makes sense as opposed

339
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:52,240
to just like, yeah, Mickey, Donald, if you want to make some cash. So they go into a forest cause

340
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,720
they're going to build like what Walt's America was like, so they can sell candy. Like that it's,

341
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,440
it's not really the way you would want to present it. We're milking daddy's childhood for sweet

342
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,080
coin. We're going to make some sweet coin. So we've got to get you out of here, Patrick. Oh,

343
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:17,840
taffy. Yeah. Sure. He loved taffy. All right. Taffy. Let's sell some glassware. $150.

344
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,440
We'll have a glass blower in there. 75%. I mean, they do do a handshake deal. Like you can stay

345
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,040
here, Patrick. And the they're like, we can help you find a place. And he's like, no, I've

346
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,040
picked something out. Like they eat, they, you're just like, okay, man, whatever. And Mickey says,

347
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,960
we'll, he just says, can I have a wee place after you've finished this Disneyland? And Mickey says,

348
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,160
fine. Which I am out. Fine. Fine. Oh God. We have to let you live somewhere. We can't just pop you

349
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:59,680
in the head. Don't be in the littlest ditch. Donald, it's like a tick. Donald 20 seconds to build that

350
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,960
ditch. This guy's got powers. We can't kill him. He could probably rise from the grave, get us in

351
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,760
the end. We've got to make a deal with him. Outsmarted by a damn patty again. Walt warned us.

352
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,880
So he says, we'll be fine. We'll build you that house. How about one of these? So they're going

353
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,640
to bet they do offer to build him. And in addition to everything else they have to do, they're going

354
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,000
to build the leprechaun a house from scratch. Which probably they were going to do it so begrudgingly.

355
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,360
It was going to suck. So Patrick's right to ask for his own. He's smart to make a deal here. He's

356
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,800
smart to make a deal. He's also like, I guess kind of a minimalist because all of his stuff fits in

357
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,440
like a tiny wheelbarrow proportional to him. But it seems like a reasonably easy move.

358
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
Yeah. So, so.

359
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,600
Where was he before do we think? Was he like, was it just kind of in the middle or, I mean,

360
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,320
it could have been anywhere. If it was all orange trees then.

361
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,360
Yeah. I think he probably had his pick. Now the original, I was trying to find, I was having

362
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,640
trouble finding like a picture of the original home, but apparently when you are getting off

363
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,680
the jungle cruise, there's like a concrete kind of tree. And that's where you would see his little

364
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,560
door before. Right. Okay.

365
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,520
And I'm not, that was removed at some point and then yeah, put back in with a fair amount of fan

366
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,080
fare at the 2015 D23. That's the other thing. They were selling the book. They were selling the new

367
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,480
printing of the book and they're also, and he might just magically appear this weekend at Disneyland,

368
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,240
his little home, you know, which if you go to the big sign that says the Indiana Jones adventure,

369
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,000
look at the bottom of a tree around there and you'll see it. I'm breaking cave. Fabe dizzy

370
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,760
at a whole like thing of cave. Fabe. Uh huh. Are you okay? You just seem like I'm having bad

371
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,880
indigestion. Oh, okay. What from what? Tell us.

372
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,560
I had like a bell, like breakfast biscuits, like a crispy like Belvita biscuit and a banana

373
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,680
and a cup of ice coffee. It was the banana. The morning banana. Jason's kryptonite. Yeah.

374
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,760
I'm allergic to banana too. Bananas are bad. Yeah. That is the lesson of this show because

375
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,840
we discovered this before the Jason, you have a banana in the morning is the worst thing you

376
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,880
can do to yourself. And then we had the day where I have to think about this one ever since. We had

377
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,640
a day where we ate hot dogs all day and then I felt bad the next day. And you said it's because

378
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,520
I had a bowl of cereal when I got home, you pinned it on. Well, that's, that's a lot of sugar.

379
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Surely it is not the day's worth of hot dog. It was the confidence in the dogs.

380
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,840
It was not a lot of hot, but I'm just saying for sure it could not have been the hot dogs.

381
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,920
It definitely was a slightly sugary, but some of it natural, some of it from blueberries.

382
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Maybe protein, straight protein. That's all. Yeah. Spoonful of peanut butter glass,

383
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
ice water, sugar to that. Depending on the peanut butter can be a little too sugary.

384
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah. I keep an eye out for it. What kind of, what kind of peanut butter? I am a, a skippy

385
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,360
natural guy. See I have that too, but that still tastes sugary to me, even though it claims it.

386
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,640
That doesn't think it's that. It's just like candy. It's delicious. But then there was also

387
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,320
the one where you were having the full fat Coke. Yeah. But then you and Jason, you got critical,

388
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,400
but then you said you were having a bit, you, I was full of that sprite, but then you said you

389
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,680
were having a Big Mac later than I have that bowl of cereal. This is what I'm just trying to figure

390
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,200
out the rubric of good eating and bad eating. I don't think when I said this show, I don't think

391
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,600
I was saying you were eating poorly. I was, I was suggesting that the cereal wasn't helpful versus

392
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,080
I wasn't saying like, Oh, you're eating poorly. And I wasn't saying like, Oh, I eat better. I'm

393
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,960
just saying, sure. I was saying though, I think like, you know, much like after like a workout,

394
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,800
you need protein, you need to replenish your electrolytes. So, you know, you did a full

395
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,640
Disneyland day with hot dogs. You need to like, whatever banana and blueberry and some flakes,

396
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,360
whatever. That was what did it. Whatever supplements Joe Rogan takes after his workout.

397
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,360
I don't know. I don't listen to the show, but whatever it is, I think that's what you should

398
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,960
have done. It's a straight protein. And then I should have just pure powder, some powder.

399
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,640
Maybe you should have had powder after probably should have done like a line of powder.

400
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,200
Yeah. Just get four, four little lines in a row snort, snort or lick.

401
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,240
Just hit the punching bag for a while. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Late night creatine bump, you know? Yeah.

402
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,520
Punching bag. That'll settle the hot dogs. That'll settle the hot dogs. Now you're doing

403
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,760
it. Now you're just kind of like, like kind of plot. You seem like you're plotting.

404
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,040
I recall the other detail that is happening with the Big Mac was that I wanted a chocolate

405
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,960
shake with it, but the only coupon in the McDonald's app was buy one milkshake, get one free.

406
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,840
And I was like, Oh no, you had two milkshakes. You can't not use the coupon. It would not be an

407
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,400
option. Why bother? You can do both in one. After full fat spray, you're at full fat spray. That's

408
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,280
going to keep you out. Then two milkshakes. Well, I had a good night's sleep the night before. I had

409
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,960
a great night's sleep after that. No, I ate half of a chocolate shake and a half of a vanilla shake.

410
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:46,320
And then I combined them and drank that the next day. So next morning, like lunchtime the next day.

411
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,600
Okay. Lunchtime. Yeah. It's a long time for milk to sit around in the freezer. That's not so bad.

412
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,880
It'll ice creamify too much more than a shake. The consistency won't be as good as fresh out of the

413
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,120
machine, but it's not so bad. Wow. Okay. Yeah. So are you recovering? Are you because you're having

414
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,840
a little? No, I feel great. No, right now you do? Huh? Yeah, I feel pretty good right now. Okay. You

415
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,960
were saying you were dealing with some indigestion just a couple of minutes ago. I don't know. I was

416
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,000
just burping. It was just repeating on me. The guy had a banana. Let's have some sympathy. I know.

417
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,280
I start coughing when I have a banana. I have like a pollen. Okay. Listeners, tell me your,

418
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,560
let's hear them all. Let's hear all your banana horror stories. I like Jason have present have

419
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,560
are making it not no longer a stigma. No, the degree to which bananas tear up your stomach.

420
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,800
We punish like little razors. So, so tell us your stories of banana horror. The only way I can eat

421
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,280
single banana or the only way I can eat bananas is when I have banana runs. That's the only way.

422
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,080
Oh, those are fine. Yeah. No, I have like that function. That was at midnight. Fine. But as far

423
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,600
as real bananas, no big problem. That's just my, that's my system. What am I? What am I going to

424
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,000
tell you? That's you lie. No, I understand. You were wired this way where it would be a banana

425
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
is like a, is an atom bomb in the stomach because you were, it is programmed for banana run. Are you

426
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,520
back on bulk candy back on bulk candy, like post COVID, like, no, I don't really about bulk candy.

427
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,720
Oh, germ wise germ wise. Well, Jason, we know COVID is not really spread surface wise. So I've

428
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,200
never really been much of a concern. I know, but it's like logically, I feel like a lot of people

429
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,760
were having issues coming over that. I have, have I gotten bulk candy since the pandemic? What a

430
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,960
question. I feel like we returned to normalcy or not. Maybe once I did, maybe once, but I, I'm not,

431
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,680
I think once at the most, if I have, and that's not necessarily because of, because of the pandemic,

432
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,880
just because I haven't been in a lot of situations where I desire. I haven't gone into a movie at

433
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,840
city walk in forever. So that's usually when I would get a little bag of candy as you load up

434
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:04,000
over it. It's sugar. You get a couple of candy thongs in your pocket and a bulk bag. And then

435
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,760
you eat the thong while you're watching age of Ultron Avengers, a Ultron is that I've never

436
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,880
taken a candy thong into the movie theater. And it's no never candy's not good. You're not going

437
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,880
to do well. It's like, you know, it's weird. The best candy is on candy thongs. I mean, I'm not

438
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,840
saying I won't now that I've said it, let's all do it. But I think the candy candy is like the candy

439
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,600
necklace candy, which is fine. It's kind of like Smarties, which all like, I feel like once you'd

440
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,160
be eating a candy necklace, you'd kind of get tired of it halfway through. Have you got,

441
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,200
have you recently gotten a candy necklace and worked your way around that? But I ate enough

442
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,720
candy necklaces as a child. Do you mean your share of candy necklaces? They were never my favorite.

443
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,040
I'll tell you my, I don't, they weren't mine either. My, my current scam is a CVS runs a lot

444
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:01,280
of buy two, get one free of movie box candy, which it's like $6 at the theater. So it's like 150 at

445
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:09,680
CVS. So if I have extra bucks, I'm like, well, guess I'm buying movie box candy. So I have, I,

446
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,160
any freebie like CVS, which I think is mostly a scam. I think everything's overpriced there.

447
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,600
And then they trick you with coupons to get it down to like, yeah, like Coles cash. So Coles

448
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:26,640
tricking me. Yeah. So you guys do, you've had, you've had enough Coles cash experience to be

449
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,440
damn cold. I'm not mad at Coles, but I'm just saying it is a whole big trick. Yeah. It is a big,

450
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,320
it is a big shell game, a three card Monte table with a shell game on it. And that's the way I

451
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,920
feel the shady weed table at the bottom of your Margarita. Exactly. Or, uh, you know what I,

452
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,360
I've, I have trying to, I tried to keep candy out of the apartment, but lately I've, I've had

453
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,160
cookies in there. There are cookies at sprouts and I'm surprised I haven't told you this in private,

454
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,040
but I'm going to do it in public. They're sure you're willing to go on the record.

455
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:05,200
So I am willing. Uh, there are berry cookies that sprouts that I will eat the fucking box

456
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,560
within two days of like 12. They are so good that they're soft. They have like a berry taste

457
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:21,200
and I can't get enough. I, I, I, I go, goo goo. You heard it here first. Mike is goo goo for berry

458
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,400
cookies for berries, for berries. So no candy, but bonkers for berries. And I have no adverse

459
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,920
reaction to berries on like bananas. So they're not banana cookies. So that's what, that's what

460
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,840
I've been indulging in lately. I think the new, all right. So on the, on club three, uh, Jason

461
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,640
reading this book, Jason's tuck in time, then you'd suggest it because you have the suggestion that

462
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,400
we should all try candy thongs. So we do, we post like a weird half hour video. That's just us

463
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,280
silently eating candy thongs and then sometimes like holding them over each other's mouth. Like

464
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,680
we're like, we're all having grapes together and like, oh yeah, some of yours are we, um, are we,

465
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:14,240
are we pacing ourselves? Like I could knock that in 10. I feel like we have to do it now with that.

466
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,080
Oh, no, it's a challenge. I don't know. I don't know. Jason's 10 minute candy thong challenge.

467
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,040
Are there sizes for the candy thongs? What's that? Are there different sizes for the candy thongs?

468
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,600
I'm not quite sure on the current sizing or if it's a one size fits all sort of thing.

469
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:36,720
Oh, we know one size doesn't fit all thong wise. It would be more, you know, I think thoughtful and

470
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,040
body positive for them to have a full range of candy thong sizes.

471
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,760
I'm sure the people who make candy thongs for it's sugar are very thoughtful and body positive.

472
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:53,680
Yeah. The makers of candy urine or forward thinking. They're down that aisle on the left.

473
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,440
They're next to the cereal box labeled dingleberries, you know, but all size of

474
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,600
dingle bear. We're very dingle positive. Yeah. Okay. Well, look, this is, you might've said it

475
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,400
accidentally and stepped in it, but I think everybody's going to want to see if you can clear

476
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,280
quickly and polish off a candy thong candy or in a candy. I'm taking a look at the picture.

477
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,120
Yeah, take a look. Okay. And I might be defeated because this isn't my favorite and sometimes

478
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,240
too much sugary stuff. Candy garter like Jason and I had to take off of our high school dates.

479
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,240
I know that wasn't a candy garter. No, it was not. Only here's what we're dealing with. I think

480
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,360
my only concern is that my teeth are going to hurt sugary stuff like that.

481
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,240
Well, you just brag that you could do this in 10 minutes. Can you estimate

482
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,400
an amount of sweet tarts though? Right. Jason, this is a lot.

483
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,600
I mean, if I can have water with it, work some Joey chestnut magic on this. There are different

484
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,360
are you allowed to disintegrate and then drink the melted? I'd be more concerned if it was gummy.

485
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,600
Like for example, I have a box of Jujyfruits on me right now. Wow.

486
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,120
Very good. And yeah, that I those would those take me a few a couple of settings,

487
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,720
dots or that sort of thing. So the gummies six in your teeth. Oh man, this next live show,

488
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,200
maybe we should have you do it. Good. I just like, well, let me time it. Like I let me,

489
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,600
I feel like it'd be artificial if we tried to squeeze it into something. Oh my God. If I just

490
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,160
eat it naturally throughout a live show and I have a stopwatch going there. OK, so what I

491
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,760
showed kind of pulling you out of like being able to talk, I get a part of the show. OK, no, no way.

492
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,800
I had to showed you what I believe. Yeah. Is this like the thong they have? It's it's sugar. And I

493
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,360
don't know if they have this, but this apparently is a new thing called the candy posing pouch,

494
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:03,040
which is a thong specifically for scrotum and testicles. Yeah. Well, testicles,

495
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,040
scrotum pretty much same thing. I don't know. Scrotum keeps the testicles. Excuse me. Yeah.

496
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,560
So I don't know if this is this is less. It's really scrotum in a way. It's like it is a

497
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,600
candy scrotum. So we'll take a look when we get into a chugger to see which has the more

498
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,320
pieces and then whatever has more will buy for Jason. It's going to be more. It's the most

499
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,920
we got to deal with this. Mm hmm. OK, be very funny. It'll be a first for me. Well, vomiting

500
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:37,360
on stage is vomiting. Is the sugar my I think what would likely happen is the sugar will coat

501
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,720
my throat too much back of my throat and I'll start to feel ill and it'll probably be worse

502
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,800
because I'll start to freak out. And then and then we'll we'll do some investigation into your

503
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,120
Kohl's cash history. And actually, you've gotten ripped off for seven dollars via Kohl's cash

504
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:56,880
second vomit. Well, vomit. If you got the Kohl's cash going and you got the capital one shopping

505
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,560
in your browser, you got the honey app going, you know, you can save some money. Yeah. Honey

506
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:08,560
app never works for me. Yeah, it's not really worked for me. Yeah. OK. In summary, the little

507
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:15,280
man of Disneyland. Yeah. Charming tale about what's possible when you're nice to the people who live

508
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,600
in your the little people who live in the grounds you bought. Mm hmm. What a yeah. What a wholesome

509
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:28,880
tale. What a pure tale. What's nice, though, is what I like about this. I don't think I'd put all

510
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,560
this together that like because I was like, OK, so there's a book and then they tied it together

511
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,240
with you can go see his house at the base of a little tree. But I didn't know the timeline on it.

512
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,360
I didn't know that this book I don't know if it predated Disneyland, but it's very possible. It's

513
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,440
same year, right? So it was like all these little marketing pushes they did. I mean,

514
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,360
talking about building, I mean, they've melt for decades. The footage of like walking around

515
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:04,640
Orange Grove said like backhoes, you know, digging things out, you know. And so what I'm saying is I

516
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,880
think that it's neat that like here's here's where they leave it in the book. So when you visit

517
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,160
Disneyland, keep your eyes open. Maybe you'll see a wee man in green smoking a small clay pipe.

518
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,000
Follow him when he goes. Follow him to his house. A nice thing to do. Follow him home.

519
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,160
Find out where he lives. If you do, you'll be the only one in the world who's found

520
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,120
Patrick Begora's home. So I kind of like what this is doing is planning this little

521
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,320
IRL Easter egg hunt. Like you maybe you get this book, you've read it. You're a little kid in 1955

522
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,480
or in 2015. You read it before you go to Disneyland and now you're like, there's a

523
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,040
little thing that I can try to find and they don't tell you where it is. Of course you can Google it,

524
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,800
but it's a fun thing to keep your eyes out for. So I guess I like that that it's a

525
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,200
little adventure that they're assigning you that can straddle medium. It's from a book,

526
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,760
but then you go to a real place and you can stalk an already kicked out of his home man to his second

527
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,040
home. Right. And you can hear him inside upset that he made this decision because of how loud

528
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,400
it is out there and how many people are just clomping around and he's probably like moving

529
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,080
around from the vibrations from the tourists. They're redoing the tree house again. They said

530
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,840
Tarzan was the last time. They don't acknowledge that it would be very noisy if he builds a new

531
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,000
place in Disneyland. Yeah, that he would not be, yeah, he would be living. Are you okay?

532
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,400
Okay. Okay.

533
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,240
Boxes, juice, you fruits. I'll be ready. Right. It's right. You need to be cracking

534
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,400
now. Yeah. You send in some runs to go attack that damn real banana. What if I had a whole

535
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,560
pound of runs loose, loose runs, banana runs in my bed? Are there run thongs? Can we make one?

536
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,680
I could. No, I mean I couldn't, but I guess you just take like dental floss

537
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,720
but you have to string them through a little hole. I guess. Yeah. Sounds like a very small

538
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,320
precise hole. That's something we can put Patrick to work doing. Okay. Yeah. Little pickaxe to make

539
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:10,560
little holes in banana runs for an all run thong. Yeah. Now we're talking. It's very,

540
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:17,760
it's funny also to look back to 2015 and go like this might be one of the things I remember most

541
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,000
fondly about the so-called diamond 60th anniversary. The return of the little man.

542
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,160
What a letdown that was. Yeah. It was kind of turfed out. I think it's kind of interesting.

543
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,400
You guys really glommed onto the diamond because you still bring it up. I don't know what the hell

544
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,600
the celebration was, but you like had hopes for the diamond. It's the diamond, you know,

545
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,160
here on new year's 2015. I'm just glad there's something to look forward to the diamond celebration.

546
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,640
Sure. To be remarkable. I had family visit twice that year and we stayed down there two times and

547
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:58,480
every piece of paper had diamonds on it. And I still find like in like boxes or stuff for like

548
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,440
bookmark like little diamond ticket stubs or receipts with diamonds on it, like that sort of

549
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,680
thing. I was there all the time in 2015. I just didn't register the diamonds. Did not care. Yeah.

550
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,560
They were like the little diamond logos. Yeah. They just did. There was a big, there were big

551
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,200
plans and then they had to pull them back because of, I think the Shanghai park was there. I think

552
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:27,280
Shanghai, similar to Paris, cost a lot more than they initially set aside. But we got the hat box

553
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,760
ghost. Hat box ghost is probably the highlight. Yeah. The return of the hat box ghost. And the

554
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,320
diamond set list of the tea party. Of course. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yes. I mean, I feel like I read

555
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,280
stuff online that people didn't see through at the 50th, 10 years before that either.

556
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,480
I don't know what that was either. Yeah. I mean, it's been down since 35. So,

557
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,000
how many more years till the next one? Oh, three, two or three. Yeah.

558
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,440
Not all the way. And it's going to be a, it's going to be a real blockbuster. She whiz,

559
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,640
but at least they did this. This is nice. They gave Leprechaun his false door back and you can

560
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,640
go see it. It seems like you can get up pretty close to it. You can knock on the door. There's

561
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,600
not a big line to get to this door. There will be after this episode. Obviously. And you know what?

562
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,200
Just go, this is what Patrick and the Disney company would want. Go up to his door, knock on

563
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,800
it, see if anything happens. If not, just leave a candy thong there or bring a candy thong with you.

564
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,800
It's sugar first. Cause that'll, that'll feed a Leprechaun for days. It's how he's good luck.

565
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:43,920
We'll rub off on you. And you know, I, I would love it. A candy rub on your private area. Buy

566
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:51,680
a candy thong and let good luck rub off on you. Let a Leprechaun rub off on you. You'll get a

567
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:59,680
sugar rash. Yeah. Sugar rash, better than a sugar rash. I think little golden should re-examine a

568
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,720
lot of the other little details at Disneyland. Write a book about the people on the party line

569
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,960
on Main Street or that you can hear down that one alley above you at the windows. You can hear like

570
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,480
people talking at the end of the one alley by the Starbucks and there's a party line phone in there.

571
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,800
Party line phone. You've listened. I picked up the phone, I guess, but outside of the phone.

572
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,360
Write a book about the two-tone light bulb. Our beloved, our favey. Did we talk about this on the

573
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,560
show? Yeah, we did. Hot dogs. We did. Yeah, in the hot dog episode. We found the two-tone light bulb.

574
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,720
We weren't 100% sure where it was. Uh huh. Yeah. We definitely did talk about it though.

575
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,480
Almost positive. Cause I think your, your whole thing was like, like you were like

576
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,160
annoyed with us for mentioning it. Yeah. I'm pretty sure. And we were trying, Mike and I were looking

577
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:53,520
out. They were selling, I think very briefly selling sippers. Well that was, we got, we got,

578
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,160
we got faked out. We got faked out with that fan made thing. A fan made cause they were selling

579
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,280
the light bulbs from the electrical parade. They're getting too good. Somebody made a

580
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,080
Photoshop of like them selling the half white, half red light bulb, but that was fake. That was

581
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,240
just a little joke we played on. Uh, we got tricked. Jason and I got tricked. Yeah. It's

582
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,440
gonna be the most obscure thing ever discussed in the corner of Disneyland. There's a light bulb

583
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,200
that is half red and half white and they were selling bulb sippers, but somebody did a prank

584
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:28,240
bulb sipper of half and half bulb sipper. Yes. Somebody did a prank of the bulbs fake. I got the

585
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,560
ultimate prank. I'm going to prank the world. That's right. Me and prank Bane.

586
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,120
Yeah. Yeah. So, so we were, yeah, they did not sell that, but we were excited because we were

587
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,320
ready, Jason already to buy it. Oh yeah. We were ready to put, put that money down. Yeah. It was

588
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,400
cumbersome, like pain in the ass thing we would have had to carry all day, but it wasn't worth it.

589
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,360
Yeah. Yeah. We would have gone next to on my bookshelf next to those Austin Powers action figures.

590
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,280
Have you taken those out of the packaging? No, still in box, still in box. Yeah. I got a couple

591
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,320
things I'm debating. Like, do I take this out? Do I leave this in? Do you have, are you, do you think,

592
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,560
what do you think about your collecting? You think you're an inbox guy? I, I I'm kind of splitting

593
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:13,600
different. Some of these throwback ones. Cause the, cause the retro cards. Yeah. The retro cards.

594
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,120
There's a retro war machine action figure that I remember the day dragging my mother to toys are us

595
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,240
to buy that original action figure. Yeah. So you're going to get that new one. Yeah. I don't know if

596
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,240
I'm going to be able to take that out of the box. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you want that hit, hit of that

597
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,960
adrenaline, hit that serotonin. Serotonin. When you see that thing from your child. Yeah. I hear it.

598
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,960
Like a tiny leprechaun lighting a fresh pipe first thing in the morning. Have they, are they, are they

599
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,040
still making this? And are there, is anybody contemplating taking the pipe away and editing

600
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,840
the pipe out? Because as we know, I've been complaining about Disney and smoking lately,

601
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:53,600
but this would seem like easily they're going to just Photoshop like a pretzel rod in his mouth

602
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,640
or something. Kids everywhere are going to want to be like their favorite leprechaun who is unseen

603
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,240
behind a door in a tree in Disneyland. So they have to get rid of his pipe. Have to get rid of his pipe.

604
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,000
But obviously like if this got in any Disney like standard and practices person's radar,

605
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,200
then they have like, there's no way they wouldn't say, take it out. Yeah. Cause they do it for

606
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,640
lesser things. We've already robbed this leprechaun of everything. His home was taken, his land. He

607
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:27,680
lost or killed everyone else in his clan. And then he got kicked out of his house.

608
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:35,280
And we, and his book wasn't published for many years. We cannot remove his pipe from it. If you

609
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:42,800
look up his like character Wiki, the only interest it says on there is smoking. We can't drop this

610
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:49,680
man of his only interest. Photoshop. If anyone wants to Photoshop out the pipe and put in a

611
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:57,440
candy thong in his mouth, because like, let's get ahead of it with different, you know, Disney's

612
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:03,520
going to put something in his mouth. So go wild with it. It'll be a delicious 10 minute meal.

613
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,240
Health. Cheers. You survived podcast, the ride. Thanks for subscribing to the second gate. If

614
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:19,120
you want to see, if you want to be tucked in with this story by Jason or see Jason eat a candy

615
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:24,160
thong in 10 minutes, this is, I mean, I hear you on eating it throughout a live show, but what I

616
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:30,160
really want is just one video, just phone on tripod running for 10 minutes. Let's see how long

617
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:36,720
you get. Let's see how much you can get through that thing. That's my, that's my pitch. Well,

618
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,560
we're looking into it very strongly and we're all thinking hard on it. And those are words

619
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:49,200
you can trust. Those are, that's a message of honesty. Anyway, some of that stuff and other

620
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,640
things will be on club three, where you get one more bonus episode every month in our regular

621
01:00:52,640 --> 01:01:04,080
episodes ad free. Well, bug Gora, it was fun to talk somewhat about this book, but Gora, but Gort.
