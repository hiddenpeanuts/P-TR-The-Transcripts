1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The downtown Disney or to you, What secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boring sport as my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have 18 daily, very necessary episodes and wish to do so.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the downtown Disney ordeal, level five, stage one.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm Jason Sheridan, Mike Carlson here.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, I'm here. I'm ready, stage one, yeah.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Scott Gardner.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're so close, the finish line.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Almost there. I mean, I guess I knew that the level keeper would be as far away as possible.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, I think we all knew.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe there was a chance of reprieve.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're Jason, your voice, I don't want to be being insulting here, but it sounds weary.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I, you know, I just whooped down some pizza and then it was kind of making, making me a little logy.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And you said, why don't you start this one? And I gobbled down some water.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, so you're all right. You're not just.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming back to life. I eat, getting my strength back.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is to place it in, we have done nine, this is the ninth episode in two days that we've recorded.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We don't usually do it this way.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I'm, I'm feeling it. Edwin's feeling it.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Edwin's feeling it.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Edwin is having a doggy sneezing fit.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Edwin is having a doggy sneezing fit.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Edwin is dog, is sneezed five times in a row and he's done it in such a way that is actually concerning concerning me.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's okay now though. But anyway, so yeah, we're all.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He's tired of it.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
As are we.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And then, but, and also, okay, if you're looking at the description of what we have to do today,

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and we'll have the sector keepers say it out loud, but like, we're, we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What? What?

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's getting a little, it's a little thin as we go west.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let me hear. Let's have the sector keeper prop in for a second.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell us what we're doing.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And audience see if you agree or not.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here we go.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Boys, boys, you're doing so well.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're in the home stretch.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Today's stage includes the Lego store.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ooh, fun.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Disney's pin traders.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Monorail station.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And Jason.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Various street carts.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Good luck, boys.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm, uh, I mean, you know, listen to that list.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I was partially why, like, we, you know, we got a little bit of Lego store from Carly, but I felt like it had to get drafted over here.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Just to give us something.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Various street carts.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Various street carts.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Even as we were making up the list, we were running out of steam.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think you were typing out this chunk.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Where Michael, one of you got like, we're running out of steam typing it when you get to various street carts.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is kind of where I, yeah, I was nervous about getting to this point in list form.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And now we're here in record form after nine.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I, we didn't really touch the carts at CityWalk.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like there's some really janky carts.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, we had to pull them in just due to lack of.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's those Kanye West graduation carts at CityWalk.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You know, those glasses with the slit like slits in there.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Those are there at CityWalk.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We should have reviewed those.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Honestly, we didn't.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's obviously in CityWalk revisited.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We've, we've announced a lot of, casually announced a lot of different sagas and ordeals.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This whole side of the harbor.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So that's another one.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mostly the carts.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That one's going to focus on the carts.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The harbor, you guys are going to, I will either die of stress or self-inflicted.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And my parents will call you guys cursing the very idea of the harbor hoedown as the cause.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Those words, he was muttering it and now he's not with us anymore.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I believe we, we, we were drafted to help start up SNL Bahrain.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh yeah.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I mean, that's what I'm working on.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You would take a leave of absence.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's what I'm going to try to do.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm, I'm, yeah, I'm calling them.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you're gone for two weeks for any reason, I think we'd do the hoedown.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's just immediately.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think that's sort of an emergency lever we pull and we immediately do a saga.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mike and I set up shop at the, our friends at the Anaheim Hotel.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then yeah, which is Captain Kidd's and it's the other hotels.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We booked two days.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That McDonald's honestly, I mobile ordered from once.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is a bit of a preview of the harbor hoedown, the Harbor Boulevard street, which is right by Disneyland.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Maybe you'll entice me back in.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the mobile ordering at McDonald's on Harbor is slow, especially in the morning.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a big rush.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So do not mobile order.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I would actually recommend just ordering at the counter from a human, which I don't like to do.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Maybe based on that, we should maybe start pre-selling tickets like passes to the, we can make this like an extra Patreon tier.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's like 25 bucks a pop because you're going to get info like that around everything.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Maybe Jason and I just spin this podcast off into another Harbor specific podcast.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's all sort of about Harbor and the comings and goings of that specific street in Anaheim.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We'll just do that and that'll be that $25.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We start doing human interest stuff, interview the people who work there.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Anytime we try to, Hey, would you be interested in, no, I don't want to get in trouble with IHOP Corporation.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah. With Captain Kidd himself sends out like heavies to like, stop asking questions.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But that will be bar 25.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Be gone, Avast, yee.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Be gone.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You no good land lovers.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is no scandal here.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We did not just have a tray of onion rings with just breading and no actual onions present.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Get out of here.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And certainly there wasn't one that was motor oil inside.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Tiffany had his strength turpentine. It's fine.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
$25 on Patreon is what that'll be.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Only paywall, paywall only, no free feed.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
$25 tier.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah. That's what he was, Scott was saying.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think that, so we'll see.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, we'll see how long.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You got to value what you're selling.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah. So much more valuable than this podcast.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah. Yeah. We're getting away for free now.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We weren't back in the, back in the underworld, but, but now we're up.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah. Hey, we're back where we've beaten Robert Earl.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We're, we're on our way to whatever the, the finale of the steam thing is.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And we are having yanked the eight, the Lego store into this level, just to have something to talk about.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's talk about the Lego store.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah. Okay.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay. What do, who wants to, you want to go first? You go first.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah. I mean, well, Carly gave us our totem. She gave us our mini figs.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Of all of us. It was very, very lovely gift.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I liked the Lego store.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Lego store has always had a presence at downtown Disney, both coasts, Disney Springs, like Prince Charming, fighting Maleficent in Lego form, like Belle and Beast.

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That is Prince Charming from Sleeping Beauty, right? That's the, yeah.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Prince Philip. Prince Philip. Okay.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah. It's not, he doesn't have the charming moniker.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was a little bit of a Lego kid. I had a number of Lego sets. I had the Lego bases that you would build stuff on, kind of keep it organized.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I really liked mixing stuff all up and like making my own little contraptions and creations.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay. So Scott Lego kid, yes.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Pretty, how, what if, what kind of like a few sets or?

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah. I don't, I don't remember if I, the same as you and Turtles where I liked it a lot, but I don't remember it nearly as well as you do.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right. Fair enough. Fair enough.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I had a little spaceship. I had a far, like a Robin Hood medieval kind of thing with a few figures.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah. I had some cars.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There were, and I'm trying to remember the name of them. I had.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Not a lot of licensed stuff back then. Lego proudly not licensed back then.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And the thing that saved them was getting into licensing.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Right. They were doing, they were having trouble financially. And then they decided to make all of the IPs, which is what everyone's doing.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's happened everywhere. And it saved Lego because now you can get Marvel superhero, DC superhero, Star Wars, everything.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah. Also creating their own character. Those Ninjago, I'm sure they're still popular.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ninjago?

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ninjago.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know. I think Ninjago.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A few years ago were so big. Like people I knew with kids were like, I don't know. I like all this Ninjago stuff.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is there a Lego set for that Willem Dafoe Pattinson movie?

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh man, if I could get a lighthouse Lego set.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Lego Lighthouse Pals?

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I bet there's a lighthouse one that I could like customize. That I could paint.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sure there's customizable minifigs and I'm sure there's like fan painted ones.

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Like when people buy an action figure and make it paint it and redo it to a different character.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So my favorite thing in Lego that I ever had, and I believe this is the thing, there was an Ice Planet 2002 series of Lego.

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And they had their own sort of like, I don't know, they didn't really have a narrative, at least that I saw, but I had this and it was so exciting.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because it had, I liked all the futurey type things with spaceships and this was, these are guys that would explore some sort of ice planet, probably not on like Hoth.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And then they would have skis on the bottom of their Lego feet. And I was obsessed with this. I still have it in a Rubbermaid somewhere.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So I was very into it, but I was not like, I had honestly like two big sets and then just like a lot of random blocks.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I was never like a hardcore Lego kid. I want to be a hardcore Lego guy, but there's no room in this apartment.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, certainly.

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And no, certainly.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a lot of, every corner is jammed with toys already.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You'd have to get rid of Dexter Jetser.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's out of the question. Although I think there was probably a Lego Dexter Jekster somewhere if they made a space diner.

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Dexter Jekster holds a place of honor next to a framed photo of you and Lindsay.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's a good point.

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And a video game controller, which I think is just there because it's practical to be there.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, because she has some thing, some nail there.

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But it is not, Dexter Jekster is clearly just decoration.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah. And then this in the living room is where I have the least amount of my toys. They're mostly up in my office area, which it's crazy.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So anyway, but I have friends who have like, you know, they bought the Millennium Falcon or they bought just Boba Fett's Slave I and have constructed.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It does seem fun. I think there's something like fun about constructing a thing. I haven't done a puzzle in years.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Some of those big sets though are like rent for a month or like a mortgage payment.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They were displaying in the Lego store the Star Destroyer from Star Wars and it was $700.

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah. Yeah. So like it's so, I think the, they have a Death Star, which is around the same price.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They have some Disney Park specific stuff, which again is trying, it's getting me closer.

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, I got, I like the Main Street station that even that though is 400 and there's different rooms and stuff.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I do have, I did have to laugh because there is one room and I think it's just supposed to be a sitting room with a chair.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like I really like the, the like Telegraph office with Dale in there.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But there is a room up here with like a chair with a side table, but it looks like a toilet.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It looks like it could just be a bathroom with a toilet and toilet paper in it.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, you can, obviously the fun thing about Legos is that you could do that.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You could buy the Disneyland castle and then put toilets in every room.

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So there's a lot of flexibility. Every turret has a toilet on it and you can have all the characters shitting while sitting on the toilet.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The characters like they are an engineer or a ticket taker costume or Minnie is on like a journey.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What?

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like she's, she's like got a parasol and she's got like luggage and an outfit.

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
A journey.

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, like a traveling coat.

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Is that what that's called? Is it spelled like the fun thing you go on?

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What are you saying? What word are you saying?

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A journey?

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A journey?

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
J O U R N E Y

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm going on a magical journey.

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Journey?

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, okay.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
She's traveling.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I thought you were saying it was a thing of like a clothing item.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We've been doing this a long time.

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah.

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I'm losing my mind.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We've been on a journey.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A journey that has not left this room mostly for 48 hours.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah.

239
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I've been wearing a journey. That's the way I feel.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Did anybody feel like disgusting after like just sitting in the room after yesterday?

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Just like I need to, I need to shower.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I just like, just, just sitting and waiting.

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I just, I splayed out on the bed for like 45 minutes.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I made.

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
After doing a lot of podcasting. Yes.

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I saw that Rouse picked up a frozen pizza, cooked the frozen pizza, ate it, caught my breath.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Caught my breath. Caught my, like sat for a second.

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
From the journey.

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then did three or four more levels of research and then just collapsed and came back today.

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Emotionally called your mom.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What am I doing?

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not going well.

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think we all left.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We were all like, oh, we should do this more often.

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think last night we left on a good note.

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think like one day of marathon was good and this morning we were all on edge.

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I was going to say, I didn't feel that bad.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I felt horrible this morning, but I didn't feel that bad last night.

261
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was certainly tired and I needed to rest for a second, but I didn't feel really terrible until I woke up this morning.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah.

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So whatever he's done.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So we, it was all okay.

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We spoofed it all over, but we were a little edgy this morning.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Everything's fine.

267
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Everything is fine.

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And now I'm talking about my eyes.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Everything's fine.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We're going to talk about the various tree carts.

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can feel my voice starting to go.

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's rare my voice gives out, but like.

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I found.

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So sorry.

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Monday would be happy.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Like he planted the, it's like he planted this.

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
They'll just naturally stop.

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is actually what I had.

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's much cooler than what I showed you.

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The listener doesn't know what you're showing.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm trying to show you guys.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think it's the same item that's just a box.

283
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But talk to them.

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They're listening.

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Nonsense.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It is cool.

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You used to have to use your imagination to fill out the world.

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Now it's like one to one.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This looks like the Simpsons is bad car.

290
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They're big stand that they hate.

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The, uh, I had, oh, I had a thing with those, with those domes.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It was a spaceship that had like Homer's dome.

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then it's bad car that everyone hated.

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh yeah.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So I liked that.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I think we've said this before when Homer's car was unveiled, I went cool.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You didn't understand that it was bad.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The joke did not land with me.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I was six years old and I went, oh shit, that's awesome.

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I could sit in the other dome.

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If I was in the car with my parents, I was like, that would be awesome.

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And the rest of the show is about Homer being rich from his great idea.

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's what I thought.

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And then here, here, and here, young Mike going, that's a great idea.

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah.

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It was cool.

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I liked the colors.

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It didn't make any sense to me.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Don't turn.

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm in this lane.

312
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I didn't get it.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Uh, Hey, and that baby talking machine is a good idea too.

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well, let it, if it could work.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't think Homer's did be brothers.

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The guy had figured it out.

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
No, I don't think so.

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He didn't seem like he was that smart.

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Who was the voice?

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Danny, Danny, who was also a voice in look who's talking.

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The baby.

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But nor was he a dog in the latter day.

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He was, you're right.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It was the dog.

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So it wasn't a baby voice twice.

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He wouldn't, but he was mini me in Austin pussy.

333
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The fake, the fake and Austin powers.

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I watched that recently and I forgot all about that.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Now, what I want is for that to be a full and reboot mania.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's man.

338
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was so excited about making jaws.

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh yeah.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's your niche.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We think we, yeah.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'd like to make all of Austin pussy with the original cast with Tom cruise, Gwyneth

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Paltrow, Danny DeVito, and who was Dr. Evil again?

344
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Whoever it was.

345
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And let's get him.

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Darren.

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's it was a guy who looked a lot like Bobby Darren really resemble Bobby Darren,

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
even though he was old with Bobby.

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Darren was way older.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Splish splash.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was taking a bath.

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That was the, that was, there was a writer's room discussion once where we were remembering

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that movie, the under the sea, the Bobby Darren movie with Kevin Spacey.

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And we were trying to, we were like, did he do splish splash?

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I was taking a bath.

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And when we figured out that Andrew was just like went silent for a while.

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And then like we even moved on.

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then I think writer's assistant just like, without announcing it, interrupted a sentence

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
with split splash.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I was taking a bath.

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh yes.

364
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They did it.

365
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I remember.

366
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He sings splish splash.

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I was taking a bath.

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I remember when that was like coming out or I think I was reading an entertainment weekly

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and I was in high school and they framed it as like Oscar winner, Kevin Spacey using his

370
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
cloud to get a very personal project made close to his heart where he'll play a 21 year

371
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
old Bobby Darren.

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And that was like a big moment for me to know like, yeah, Hollywood is weird.

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Like even as like a 16 year old, I was like, that's not right.

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And the whole, his romance with the, whatever the actress is, is all very like, I'm going

375
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to be in love with you.

376
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You'll see.

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's all like a creepy stalker.

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that holds up great right after American beauty, which every minute of it is poison

379
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
now.

380
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's just all.

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is one of the- Poor Annette Benning and Peter Gallagher.

382
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Actually, no, I was a poor, um, uh, Thora Birch, uh, mostly.

383
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sure.

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I feel like she had, is that Thora Birch?

385
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah, that's Thora Birch.

386
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Are you talking about Mina Suvari?

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Or Mina Suvari.

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, either- And Thora Birch is the other-

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, okay.

390
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I, both of them.

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Poor Thora Birch because Jinx the cat died in her arms and, uh, she thought Jinx was

393
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,000
dead for a little bit in Halloween classic Hocus Pocus.

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Um, this is- We're talking about Legos.

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I like them both a lot.

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
I like them both a lot.

398
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,480
This is one of those where clearly like, I think I'm in a, this is maybe for me, the

399
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,440
equivalent of the drunk episode of City Walk Saga where I've been like slowly nursing water

400
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,080
down cold foam.

401
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,480
It's been here for hours and I'm snapping.

402
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
I'd like to talk about anything but what we have to talk, but the faster we do it, the

403
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,480
faster we free the- Yeah, the faster you hear me talk about my childhood Legos.

404
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,800
But wait, there are more pictures.

405
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,120
I gotta say- More, more jet, more space jets.

406
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,800
We alluded to this earlier and I think Mike found a great discovery.

407
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,960
Don't hype me, don't hype me.

408
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,080
This late in the- It's Iturak, god damn it.

409
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
We alluded to it.

410
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm just saying, I don't know what you're actually getting to.

411
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
The friends, the Lego friends.

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Oh yeah, yeah.

413
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Great is a, uh, especially right now when we're running out of time.

414
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
But it's in this box.

415
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,360
The bar of great is low.

416
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,400
Well yeah, so, so we, you know, we love specific IP and then there's, Lego has that and they've

417
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,120
had many different sets of like original Lego characters and now they have the very originally

418
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,320
named much like the Pandora friends, the Lego friends.

419
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,360
And the Lego friends have, they're not Ross and Rachel.

420
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,080
They're not those friends, which is confusing because they have so many different IPs.

421
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
You would think if it was called- Do they have a friend set?

422
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,040
I don't think so, but I've seen, sometimes you see mockups of things and you're not sure

423
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,960
if they're real or not.

424
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,360
But they have the Lego friends and they're all, you know, characters and there's, I was

425
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,880
looking at this, there's a TV show of the Lego friends and the Lego friends are what

426
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,640
looked to be, and I guess this is sort of just, you know, a little bit more modern cause

427
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,040
I think they used to have sort of more domestic Lego sets and it was like, this is for girls

428
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,680
and it's about playing house and stuff.

429
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,640
Now the Lego friends, they all do insane things like rescue a boy from rocks in the middle

430
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,720
of the ocean.

431
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,040
It's all like high adventure with the Lego friends and there are so many shows.

432
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,960
There are so many episodes of Lego friends.

433
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,040
I had no idea that this existed.

434
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
But I like them.

435
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I do.

436
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
What are their names?

437
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
I know.

438
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,800
Was the names honestly, I don't know where my phone is, which is where I have, hold on.

439
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Let me find it.

440
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Let me find it.

441
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Mike lets his phone out of his sight.

442
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I know.

443
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I'm losing my frigging mind.

444
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,280
You've missed 40 alerts.

445
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,200
Your eye doctor told you like, how much are you looking at your phone?

446
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Didn't he say like your eyes are very dried out?

447
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,880
She said, yeah, there was a day I had really bad eye strain the day before I went to the

448
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,280
eye doctor and she was like, your eyes are really red.

449
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,560
And I was like, I think it's cause I look at my phone too much.

450
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,940
And she goes, she goes, I don't know.

451
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
She goes, they're really red.

452
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
I don't know if that would do it.

453
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,760
I go, I do look at it a lot.

454
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,600
I have, meanwhile, I've been doing digital detox that I've turned off all notifications

455
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,280
except texts and emails.

456
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,800
Well, aren't you so special for the great scale?

457
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
I can't know.

458
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Living a pure life.

459
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,160
He does know I'm not doing, it's hard.

460
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,720
My digital addiction continues.

461
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
So some of the characters.

462
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,040
I've just been reading Joker tweets nonstop.

463
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
All takes every take.

464
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,840
I don't know what everyone thinks.

465
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,160
So, I think he's the clown prince of crime.

466
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:58,720
Ethan, Andrea, Andrea, Anne, Angus, Mia, Olivia, Andrea again, Emma, Vicky.

467
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,360
I think they might be the same people, but some of them are in different sets.

468
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,640
Daniel is also one and he's got like kind of a letterman jacket on.

469
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
And yeah.

470
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,760
Why are they, why are they interesting?

471
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Why are they interesting?

472
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
They all have boring names.

473
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
They all have boring names.

474
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Angus.

475
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Angus?

476
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
No.

477
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
You don't think Angus is interesting?

478
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,360
There's a whole movie called Angus in the nineties already.

479
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,120
I guess that's a good point.

480
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,980
Here they are.

481
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,240
They are, this is a theme park set where they're on some sort of an octopus ride, which is

482
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
pretty cool.

483
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,880
Oh, I got stuck on one of those once as a kid where I just like, well, it wasn't that

484
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
it got stuck in the air.

485
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
It just wouldn't stop.

486
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,240
And like me and my dad are always saying, we're like, stop it.

487
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,240
You've been going, it's running too long.

488
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
The Lego friends.

489
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Here's the problem though.

490
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,760
They're still like, you're not wrong about the generic names.

491
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:57,240
If I'm a kid and I go in there and it's between the Lego friends or my friends from Star

492
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,920
Wars Rogue One, like K2SO, I'm going K2SO.

493
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,840
I do think they need to maybe differentiate them a little bit more, but maybe it's very

494
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
popular and I don't know.

495
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm not the right demographic, I guess.

496
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:15,440
The Lego friends like today, does this include, there's a bunch of girls who are more humany.

497
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Some of them wear headbands.

498
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,120
Are those Lego friends?

499
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
What you described was very general.

500
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,800
Are you saying specifically what you were looking at?

501
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Let me see them.

502
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,560
There's a lot of big Lego stuff outside the store.

503
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,900
Like you said, the Maleficent being the beast, but also next to like the ramps where kids

504
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,240
can play and like make little cars and send them down a ramp at the Lego store.

505
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
There's all these girls.

506
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Anyway, I was hanging out with them and I was in heaven with this surrounded by these

507
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
ladies.

508
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I don't know, they might be like 15.

509
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
No way, dude.

510
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
I think they're young.

511
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
I don't know that.

512
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,760
Maybe these are the, yeah, these are like instead of generic city, like I feel like

513
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,440
there was like the police and the city hall and the apartment building.

514
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
Like this is that version of that nowadays.

515
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,160
I'm sure they still have that.

516
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,720
And those are like, and they also, I think they bought, no, no, that's different.

517
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,620
Playmobil is different, but they're, yeah, they always had those sort of genericky characters,

518
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,840
but now it's lost world.

519
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,840
You can, it's Owen Grady you can get.

520
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,000
And Claire Dennis.

521
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,640
Claire Dennis.

522
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,600
Why would you want?

523
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Dearing.

524
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Claire Dearing.

525
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,840
They're confusing her with the singer, Kathy Dennis.

526
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
That's right.

527
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,320
Writer of the song toxic.

528
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,160
I think I was confusing her with Kat Denning.

529
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,240
Oh, that too.

530
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
With two broke girls, Kat Denning.

531
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Yeah.

532
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Nick and Nora's infinite playlist.

533
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Thor.

534
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,120
This is my, this is an infinite podcast.

535
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,960
They have, look, they have Lego city where you get to like have generic Lego guys do

536
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
jobs.

537
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Right.

538
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
That's like Lego movie.

539
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,080
Lego movie was very big for generic Legos and IP Legos.

540
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,480
Lego is out of control, honestly, with how many things there's Lego elves and it's like

541
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,720
their own brand of elves.

542
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,120
They're on top of the world.

543
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
Brickheads.

544
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,080
They're bigger Legos that you create bigger characters and there's like Mickey and Harry

545
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,480
Potter.

546
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
It's the, the, there's sims.

547
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,200
It's insane how many different Legos things there are right now.

548
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I don't want to say that there there's a fall coming, but it does feel like Legos flying

549
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,640
a little close to the sun with all these lines and stuff.

550
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Really?

551
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Okay.

552
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
You think it's over?

553
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,000
I actually, I think that's all he smooth sailing.

554
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I think the IP is.

555
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Polly's are fun.

556
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We determined many days ago.

557
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I guess that's true.

558
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,120
IP is going to save them.

559
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,260
Let me say this.

560
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,400
This is a store that I would have been obsessed with as a kid cause of the back wall where

561
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,520
you can truly put together whatever combination of blocks you want.

562
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,680
That was such a thing I wanted as a kid.

563
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Yeah.

564
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,840
And the idea that we would have gone into that store and I would have gotten to, you

565
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,120
know, put together all one color blocks or something.

566
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,200
That's so great.

567
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
That's great.

568
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,520
And yeah, I have some really appealing pictures.

569
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,200
I was exploring the store and just putting my phone like inside a little orb full of

570
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,440
a ton of a ton of carrots or a ton of baguettes.

571
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
That's great.

572
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah.

573
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
It's like such, such wonderful colors that are great to look at.

574
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,600
It reminds me like doing like the, like the Mr. Rogers, like tour the crayon factory.

575
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Yes.

576
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,560
Seeing a bunch of vibrant colors altogether.

577
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,680
Maybe it very, very fun.

578
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm sure you any like, this seems like such a good place for, well, I was going to say

579
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,600
two or three year old, but you know, choking hazards, but you know, five and up.

580
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,520
It's a rare thing I think in downtown Disney, especially so much of being so boring that

581
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,280
it might actually distract you from Disneyland being right around the corner.

582
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,080
But I think this could eat up your time for a while.

583
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,200
There's magic in this place for a child specifically or an adult collector.

584
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,240
Even the earlier iterations of Lego stores.

585
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
I like loved going in as a kid.

586
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I couldn't spend any money, but I would like play around and then race the cars.

587
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
You can play in outside.

588
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,720
I feel like I would have been intimidated to play with the other kids because there's

589
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,760
so many kids digging through Lego outside Lego stuff outside.

590
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,800
I feel like I would have been like scared or like I was going to be made fun of for

591
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
making a Lego thing wrong.

592
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,960
Like that doesn't look good.

593
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,400
Like idiot and I would have been like ashamed of myself.

594
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,320
There's a big Darth Vader in there too.

595
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
That's cool.

596
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Yeah, that's cool.

597
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
The store itself.

598
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,240
There's like, you know, the displays are great and they've been at downtown Disney for so

599
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
long.

600
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,880
It's like a good part of the fabric of yes.

601
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,320
Yeah, this is good.

602
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,920
Don't let our fatigue fool you into thinking we don't like this.

603
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Lego.

604
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
There's a Lego.

605
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,760
You can get a Lego mosaic.

606
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,560
You can for $120 or something.

607
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,640
What does that mean?

608
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,960
That means you can get like a Lego recreation of your face.

609
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,760
And it's OK.

610
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Weird.

611
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,040
And I thought about like trying to figure out if we could do it, but it's so expensive.

612
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Yeah.

613
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Yeah.

614
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
There's a big one.

615
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
All right.

616
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Moving on.

617
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
That's it.

618
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
You're on means we're moving on Disney.

619
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Oh, fuck.

620
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Disney's pin traders.

621
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
All right.

622
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,560
I used to be a big Disney pin trader kid.

623
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,760
The first few years of it.

624
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
I loved it.

625
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Yeah.

626
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,680
When I went every year, I would always come back with a few pins.

627
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,800
I liked how brightly colored they were.

628
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,200
A lot of simple designs.

629
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
You still got them.

630
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,680
I have some out here and then some are on.

631
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
I used to decorate.

632
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,280
I had a lamp shade in my childhood bedroom that is covered in pins.

633
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Really?

634
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah.

635
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,760
I got to take a picture of that next time I'm home.

636
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,720
I don't know how to ship the lamp out.

637
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't know how to gently.

638
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,840
I guess I got to pack it and ship it.

639
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,360
Is your childhood home or is your childhood room intact?

640
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,560
Well, it was kind of boxed.

641
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:33,440
When my mom moved, my mom and stepdad moved in together, it was kind of boxed up and then

642
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
unboxed.

643
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,320
So it's kind of intact.

644
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
The version of it.

645
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,040
A version of it is intact.

646
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,800
And every time I go home, I get the, you got to get rid of this, some of this stuff and

647
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
then never do.

648
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Sounds like you do.

649
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Yeah, I definitely do.

650
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,280
So I like the pins.

651
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:57,900
Back in the late 90s, I feel like the merch was not as varied and good as it was now.

652
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,240
So the pins were kind of reliable of like getting an Alien Encounter logo or getting

653
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,240
a nice create of the like MGM Studios logo.

654
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,500
So I thought the pins were, I would allocate some of my souvenirs, spending money for that.

655
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,800
And I liked them.

656
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,620
And then it, at a certain point I drifted off and it really blew up.

657
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,720
It really exploded.

658
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,760
There is so many pins now.

659
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,360
So when you got out, it got good.

660
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm not sure if it did.

661
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,240
I don't really like this.

662
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,960
Like they have this pricing method now or like the pin, it's like it costs yellow and

663
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,880
then you have to look at a key and yellow is 8.95 and green is 9.95 and blue is 12.95.

664
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,840
What don't you like about that?

665
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
I don't know.

666
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,400
I think it's an extra step to make you think for another second that like, I really like

667
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
this.

668
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I want this.

669
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
How much is it?

670
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Okay.

671
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I'm thinking about it.

672
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,760
I'm looking up like it's like a trick.

673
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,400
It feels, I guess it's simpler for them to like stock everything.

674
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,560
I was going to say, I don't know.

675
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,520
I'm trying to think of what the angle is on that.

676
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,240
Why are they, that would be a trick versus why that's just an easy way.

677
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,360
Cause it's a small, I would assume it's because it's a small piece of merchandise and it's

678
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,600
maybe hard to put a tag, which is already kind of big.

679
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,440
They've all got tags on the back.

680
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
So I don't know why.

681
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,560
No, it just, it says yellow.

682
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,280
And then you had to look and look at yellow for the price.

683
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Maybe you're onto something.

684
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,800
It's a unique, it's odd.

685
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,520
They only really do it for pins.

686
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,920
And boy, how they do they have a lot of pins.

687
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,520
Powerline feel like there's multiple powerline pins, the fictional band from the goofy movie.

688
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes.

689
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,440
Uh, there is a lot of powerline stuff in general, I feel like.

690
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,760
But it does feel like they have pins maybe is the most varied place of like very types

691
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,480
of characters on merchandise.

692
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,280
Here's a pin of Chip and Dale stealing Donald's mixtape.

693
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Why?

694
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,800
I don't know why he has a mixtape.

695
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,680
I heard so much disdain in your.

696
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Yeah, really?

697
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
It's all, it all fell apart.

698
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,280
My whole life fell apart in that phrase.

699
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,400
There was a chip and Dale are still in some mixtape.

700
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,880
I had to ask you cause I couldn't remember what it was from the badge that Jiminy Cricket

701
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
wears.

702
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Yeah, you didn't recognize that.

703
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,080
It's his, I forget what it says.

704
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Conscience.

705
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,480
It's his, cause he's Pinocchio's guiding object.

706
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,640
I only knew that cause it was next to another pin where it was a pin of him wearing the

707
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
pin.

708
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,240
They have pins of why they have pins of characters wearing the pins.

709
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
They have it all.

710
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,960
Truly, Disney's pin traders has it all.

711
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,800
Why don't I care about pin trading?

712
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Why do you know what?

713
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,400
All right, I'm going to throw, I'm going to throw out a take here.

714
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,640
I, uh, for sure.

715
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,800
Uh, I have said this, my wife has said this, we have in people sussing out like, oh, you

716
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
guys are like big theme park fans.

717
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
And we say, yeah, we are.

718
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,760
I mean, we're not like, you know, that we're not like pin traders or anything.

719
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,960
We have said this, somebody, I'm sure people are offended that I said that just now.

720
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Right.

721
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,240
That being said, I'm trying to figure out why, what is the, what is my aversion?

722
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,560
And I think what it might be, I don't think there's anything inherently, uh, bad or too

723
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,760
nerdy about pin trading, but I feel like a lot of people do it very joylessly.

724
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,120
Like it's, it's like, it's easy.

725
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,760
It seems, I get the sense that it is a chore for people and they show up with their like

726
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,200
ribbons with 300 on and it's just robotically sure.

727
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,160
Um, that, I mean, that I think is just the collector brain, collector's mindset.

728
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,720
And you'd find that with anything, with anything, certainly in the comic book world, I have

729
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
been guilty of it.

730
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
I know we've talked about it before me and Mike, I don't know.

731
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,440
Did you have that for anything or were you like a collector and like just collecting

732
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,920
like was more, almost more important than the, the practical nature of the item?

733
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,720
Um, not a ton.

734
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm not super, uh, collect honestly, my recent, uh, wanting to get every type of Rex was a

735
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,880
rare dip into that for me.

736
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,280
I just wanted to get the park star in the vinyl mission.

737
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,240
And you are the only one of us married.

738
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,400
Let's just sit with that for a second.

739
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Huh?

740
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Huh?

741
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Okay.

742
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Huh?

743
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,240
There is, and I, this is not this, I, there was a comic I was getting.

744
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,840
It's actually the one where I sitting right here.

745
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,240
Uh, it was sold out of the comic store that I first went to.

746
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,600
I went to a second comic store.

747
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,160
It was sold out and I felt a little bit of excitement about that because of the hunt.

748
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,680
There was some like, yeah, there's some collector brain of like, man, when I find this is going

749
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
to be good.

750
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,720
And then I wasn't, I found it in the third store and I wasn't disappointed, but it was

751
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,200
like, okay, got it.

752
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,040
And now it's like a little rare and now it's a little, so there is something collector

753
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
brain.

754
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,840
I understand the, the, the, the thrill of the chase.

755
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,800
And there's been like, you know, there's been artists where like, I want to track down all

756
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,520
these bootlegs and rare stuff.

757
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm like, oh, there's some weird Japan, Japan only, uh, rarities collection of this guy.

758
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,720
And so, and I, so I understand like completeism and it's, you know, to some extent it might

759
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,920
be the glass half empty view of me on this might be like, maybe I don't have enough passion

760
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,960
for enough things where I want to get all this stuff.

761
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,360
Uh, you know, I think that's, that's where like probably the more fun side of pin trading

762
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,440
is, uh, it's fun.

763
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,040
This thing makes me happy and it reminds me of this ride.

764
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,800
And there's a good, I'm sure there's like, I'm sure there's both elements to it.

765
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
That can be fun.

766
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Oh, I'm sure people like that.

767
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,760
And like, I, well, I think you're right that that's just how it like, you can see the people

768
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
having fun at Comic-Con and you can see the people just sort of like, you're going around

769
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,120
and doing everything in light, like, well, I have to do it all.

770
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,520
And I don't, and like not, yeah, I think that's the case with any fandom is just like, remember

771
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
this is all for fun.

772
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
So stop and enjoy it.

773
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,600
And yeah, I mean, we read the comics that we buy and I try to keep them in good shape,

774
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
but I don't care if like a little corner.

775
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I don't like that still.

776
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
That bothers me.

777
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I don't really like it.

778
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,680
We were recording Nick money, put the microphone down on the top of the comic and I, there's

779
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,200
a little bit of me when I went like, I went like, it was a little bit.

780
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, that was adding to the, the very tense Nick Monday episode.

781
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,520
He was missing up here, but also don't put it on the table.

782
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Oh yeah, of course.

783
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
And also like, I know it's fine.

784
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,920
I also know these are not that valuable anymore.

785
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Anyway, partly the publishers cheaping out on decent paper and ink and they like, I'm

786
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,160
just saying there's a thing like drilled into me as a, as a kid still of like, you know,

787
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,520
these are valuable too and you got to take care of them.

788
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,040
Uh, I would like to see more bombs.

789
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,000
I'd like to see them black cauldrons, a brother bear, some home on the range.

790
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,680
Oh, so I thought you meant like actual bomb pins of like, like a cartoon with the wick.

791
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,280
Yeah, I want to see a pin of the new bomb, the Don Adams film.

792
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,360
I don't like pins or stickers and there's some weird childhood thing about it.

793
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,000
I didn't like anything on my clothes.

794
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,080
I didn't want an extra thing, especially stickers.

795
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,480
Cause I would be like, I gotta peel it off and like, like name tags.

796
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
I hate it.

797
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I still don't like it.

798
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,300
If you have to go somewhere with a name tag that bothers me and pins, especially I have

799
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,800
some pins that are cool, but I don't, I need to figure out where to display them because

800
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,040
I will never wear them.

801
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,760
I don't care for them and I don't know exactly why that is, but I just, as a kid, I didn't

802
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,160
like something on my clothes.

803
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
I don't know.

804
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I never got into them.

805
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
You know what happened?

806
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,480
A friend, a friend of mine I was writing with, uh, got a, like an incorrect package.

807
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,120
Like it was for the person who used to live at the place and he didn't know where to find

808
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
him.

809
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
So like, ah, whatever.

810
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,400
And it was a, so it was a wrong package that got delivered.

811
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,760
There was eight Disney pins and he was like, you like Disney stuff, right?

812
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
You want to leave three.

813
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,720
If you want one of these, they just showed up here.

814
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,480
And uh, one of them horizons.

815
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Whoa, jackpot knocked it out of the park.

816
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,360
I was like, yes, I want one of these.

817
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Wow.

818
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,840
That is the one thing is they did all the Epcot logos and every now and then I see them

819
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,040
on the boards.

820
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,080
I think that would be fine.

821
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,760
I never wanted to trade them as a kid.

822
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I was so particular.

823
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Right.

824
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,680
I bought the ones I wanted and never like, I never thought about buying ones to trade

825
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,920
with cast members or other people.

826
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,240
But now every now and then I go through a store and I see one of the Epcot pins and

827
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,040
I'm like, I bet I could find a set of that.

828
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Yeah.

829
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Like I like those.

830
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,920
I would guide, I would want that full collection.

831
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,800
And it does make me think how good our logo inspired by that would be on like a nice enamel

832
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
pin.

833
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Sure.

834
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,160
That's merch I would love to offer, but I don't know how to offer it.

835
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,880
I don't know where good pins can be made.

836
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,200
We know some pin people.

837
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Yeah.

838
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,960
Well, there's actually like a couple different people that have like various interests in

839
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
pin company.

840
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,200
Like pins are very popular right now.

841
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,960
There's like an upsurge in pin popularity.

842
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,640
So I, again, I respect the pin trading community.

843
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,520
Also, I was going to say my sister got me some like old like vintage-y country bears

844
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
pins, which are fun.

845
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,840
And I have that and I would like to display them somewhere.

846
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,160
I have a bunch of Moonbeam pity, city pity, Moonbeam pity.

847
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,840
That's what I had after it got canceled.

848
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,440
There's some of these city pins that I'm not doing anything with.

849
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,080
Hey, if you want Moonbeam city pins, DM me and if we're going to be a live show, I'll

850
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,960
bring them to you or sign them or something.

851
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,440
They're pretty fucking cool.

852
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm amazed somebody made them.

853
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Yeah, they're sweet.

854
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,240
They got a good little what's the thing when you like mount them on something?

855
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
It's like a little postcard display.

856
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
I don't know.

857
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh, yeah.

858
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
A little backboard.

859
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I don't know.

860
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
It's cool.

861
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Seriously.

862
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Hit me up.

863
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,000
Got the characters faces and everything.

864
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,920
So if we know pin guys, yeah, that sounds cool to me.

865
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:28,520
And when are also when are we going to start offering our logo on a big burlap, a big burlap

866
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
sack?

867
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
That's a good question.

868
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Would you know any Jason?

869
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,120
I don't know if we know anybody in the burlap sack sayings.

870
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:41,040
The part I mean, if I know anyone burlap sacks, they're wearing them, you know, down at the

871
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,840
yard down at the rail yard.

872
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,560
You know, once they ate all the potatoes from them.

873
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Yes.

874
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,280
Put them on and I have asked around about plush a little bit.

875
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Yeah.

876
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,440
It is just not cost effective.

877
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,400
No, I feel like even hats, hats are hard to be.

878
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Yeah.

879
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,640
And then I think because I think pins are you can make pins cheaply and you make shirts

880
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,000
cheaply.

881
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,320
But I think when you get out of there, then a listener, a listener has a pin company.

882
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
He gave us some.

883
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
I forget what's the gentleman's name.

884
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Fred.

885
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Yeah, Fred.

886
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
I read.

887
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Midnight Dogs.

888
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,760
Is that right?

889
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
I might be.

890
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,600
I'm going to try to look at the spot now and I like it.

891
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,320
No, I'm going to meet this person.

892
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
I don't know.

893
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
I have no comic con.

894
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,880
Oh, I certainly didn't meet them.

895
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Also we can put up a we'll put up a picture of the great Lego us is that Carly made and

896
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,840
so you can make them too.

897
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,160
If you want Legos of us, go to the store and do it.

898
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,480
And if you have great off, yeah, Midnight Dogs and animal pins.

899
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Yeah, Fred.

900
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
They were cool.

901
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Cool.

902
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880
Here's a Spider-Man the war one.

903
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,760
I got a Rocco is modern life.

904
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,520
There was a lot of cool stuff.

905
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Yeah.

906
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,240
What you can do to with us if you make us, you can then put toilets all over your Cinderella

907
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,080
Castle and put us all in the toilet.

908
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Yeah, there we go.

909
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,360
Oh, the treat carts, the various street carts, various street carts, kind of a wasteland,

910
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,680
kind of kind of the facsimile of Disneyland on like not Disneyland churros, not Disney

911
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,640
hot dogs like diggity dog, diggity dog, a French company, a different popcorn company.

912
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,880
Some one of the stands is Sunglass icon by Sunglass Hut.

913
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Yeah.

914
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Another.

915
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Another bit.

916
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,520
This is after I think we should call this impulse by alley.

917
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,640
Yeah, because it is clearly like people going like, oh, I want a hot dog.

918
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Oh, I want popcorn.

919
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Uh huh.

920
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,120
And they don't care the level of quality or love put into it.

921
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,760
It all seems just like, I mean, the churro one, it seems like they're trying to experiment

922
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
a lot.

923
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,800
There was like, oh, it's a corn dog, but it's sriracha.

924
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,960
And they have like fruity pebbles for fruity pebble churro.

925
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,440
Like, I don't know.

926
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
It seems like people are having fun.

927
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,720
I it's fine.

928
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,480
They need to fill out that space or else it's just empty.

929
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,760
And Disney is owns these companies, but it's like, am I wrong?

930
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
I don't know.

931
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I think they're third party vendors.

932
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,600
Question, we watched that profit episode with the woman who no longer runs a popcorn cart.

933
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Popcornopolis.

934
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,200
No, no, no, because that's the big one from CityWalk.

935
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:26,240
It was something else and she was very difficult and wanted poor locations and their main money

936
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
maker was downtown Disney.

937
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,840
So that was like a separate vendor who just worked there.

938
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Okay.

939
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
No longer does.

940
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,760
So that goes to show Disney will torture.

941
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
They'll pull the plug.

942
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,360
Well, Nick money pulling our microphone cord out.

943
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,480
And there's, it's very confusing because you look up diggity dogs, there's a company that's

944
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,800
not the hot dog company, but there's a lot of different hot dog companies with a similar

945
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
name.

946
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
A lot of rappers called that.

947
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Yeah, yes.

948
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
But I wonder.

949
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
It's what my dad thinks.

950
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,400
My dad's trying to name Snoop Dogg.

951
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,240
He's like, was that no good diggity dog?

952
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,280
It's like a Hanna Barbera character.

953
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
No good.

954
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,160
Talking about him like he's snidely whiplash.

955
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,080
I'll get him one day.

956
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,200
Public enemy number one Snoop Dogg.

957
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
I'm nervous.

958
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,320
He's just, he's just been ingratiating himself for 25 years pretending he's a nice friendly

959
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
guy.

960
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,560
You know, from the beach bum, the actor Snoop Dogg.

961
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Soul planes.

962
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,920
He's in, has got to be in sag aftra.

963
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
Oh, for sure.

964
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
Yeah, of course.

965
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Yes.

966
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
He's in star skiing hutch.

967
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Yeah, he's in star skiing hutch.

968
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
So yeah, he pays bills just like.

969
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,720
Just like Mitch, Bob Iger and I went to Ithaca College.

970
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,760
Me and Snoop Dogg are at the same union.

971
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
You're bound.

972
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,000
That's your Kevin Bacon game of, yeah.

973
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,760
Well, look, I smoked weed with Snoop Dogg.

974
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,440
So that's my connection.

975
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
That's the dream.

976
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Yeah.

977
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,560
To get them to get everyone to calm down on a tense shoot.

978
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,680
And then I pretended to be cool and said that was good shit, man.

979
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,480
Wow.

980
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,120
And I've never, I felt cool in the moment because I was smoking a blunt that Snoop Dogg

981
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,640
handed to me.

982
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,720
And then I watched the video and it was the opposite of cool.

983
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,120
It's very strange.

984
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,560
I haven't talked to put that on the podcast.

985
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,640
I don't think so.

986
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,760
We revealed you did shoe or we're not sure.

987
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Shaw.

988
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
Yeah, great.

989
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,700
I smoked a blunt with Snoop Dogg and I tried to smoke as little of it as humanly possible

990
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,080
because I had to like function and do things.

991
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Oh, for sure.

992
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,000
That's that.

993
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,280
I wonder like if there's, I do, I'm just wondering about some of these carts because it's very

994
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,400
hard to find information about it or other carts.

995
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,280
So like the Sammy Duvall owned something here or something.

996
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,920
Is there some sort of Disney connection?

997
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm sure.

998
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,360
I just, I wonder, cause there's not any information on diggity dogs in this logo here.

999
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,120
So I wonder if it's just like, we need a cart name.

1000
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,120
Cause how else would you brand it if it was a Disney owned dog, hot dog?

1001
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,760
100 monkeys came up with the name diggity dogs.

1002
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,400
The typewriters.

1003
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,880
Pluto's dogs.

1004
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,520
Yeah, sure.

1005
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
But I mean, they don't.

1006
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Bolt's dogs.

1007
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
He is a dog.

1008
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
Bolt's dog.

1009
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
That's perverse.

1010
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,520
No, they're hot dogs.

1011
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
Dogs selling dogs.

1012
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,520
But dogs love eating hot links.

1013
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Yeah, that's true.

1014
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
They're always stealing those rope sausages.

1015
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,440
Okay, you're always trying to steal those rope sausages too.

1016
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,920
This was a while back, but that's, if you could, that, uh, that's like Disney bounding.

1017
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,800
You could do is anything that involved where you like are wearing like decorative, like

1018
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,240
line of sausage links around your neck.

1019
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,120
There's a German sausage company right in Glendale that supplies a lot of places.

1020
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,360
It's a deli.

1021
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,520
You can still get rope sausages there.

1022
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:46,000
So you as, if you, if you Disney bounded as Dodger from Oliver and Company.

1023
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,400
Oh, I love the Artful Dodger.

1024
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Yeah.

1025
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,920
Was he called Artful Dodger in the Oliver and Company?

1026
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,480
He was definitely called Dodger.

1027
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,480
Yeah.

1028
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,480
Yeah.

1029
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
I mean, we love children in the eighties.

1030
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,800
We've thrown around the word Artful a lot.

1031
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Yeah.

1032
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,520
But he wore sunglasses and sang with Billy Joel's voice.

1033
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,000
That's what I know.

1034
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,600
So when you're coming out of that place with the sausages, oftentimes people probably think

1035
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,160
you're, you're bounding as the Dodger.

1036
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,160
Why should I worry?

1037
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,800
With a mouth full of sausage.

1038
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Do you need a bag?

1039
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
No, I'll carry them out in my mouth.

1040
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Why should I care?

1041
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,680
You're like jumping and dancing on taxi cabs after you buy your sausages.

1042
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
Yeah.

1043
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,480
My favorite behind the scenes thing ever for the, the one that Chris is.

1044
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
Oh yeah.

1045
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,480
Yeah, that's great.

1046
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Sure.

1047
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,480
He can sing.

1048
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,480
Then can he act?

1049
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,560
He can really act.

1050
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,040
As we know, Billy Joel's thriving acting career ever since that cracked him open as an actor

1051
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
in 89.

1052
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
It is crazy.

1053
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,300
Billy Joel is not in uncut gems.

1054
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,760
It feels like Billy Joel should be in uncut gems like Mike Francesa is.

1055
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,760
Wait, what's uncut?

1056
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,760
Oh, that's the Adam Sandler.

1057
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,760
Adam Sandler movie.

1058
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Oh yeah.

1059
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
Yeah.

1060
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,400
It's actually looks like he's good in that too.

1061
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Yeah, you might be.

1062
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Where's the Lego set of that?

1063
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,160
Oh yeah.

1064
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
That would be good.

1065
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,200
The Celtics, the whole Celtics team.

1066
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,280
Yeah, that would be good.

1067
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,000
Anyway, look at that trailer.

1068
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,200
Is this movie come out by the time this comes out?

1069
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Comes out around.

1070
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Yeah, it comes out.

1071
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
I don't remember.

1072
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Towards the end of the year.

1073
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,200
Okay.

1074
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,000
Do we have to talk about the Monorail station again?

1075
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Haven't we covered it?

1076
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
We do have to talk about it.

1077
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
We did a Monorail episode.

1078
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,680
We did a whole Monorail episode, but this station specifically, we talked a little bit

1079
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,680
of it on the Carly episode.

1080
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
A little bit with Carly.

1081
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
It's a little plain.

1082
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
What is it?

1083
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,840
Is it supposed to be palm leaves?

1084
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
What is it?

1085
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
What is it?

1086
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Screen.

1087
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,220
It's kind of go away green in parts.

1088
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,920
That paint shade they use to like not catch your eye.

1089
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
Go away green.

1090
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
Go away green.

1091
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
Yeah, you're not supposed to notice it.

1092
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Yeah.

1093
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
I know, but go away green.

1094
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,800
Oh, it's what a lot of like power generators or construction walls are painted when they're

1095
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,440
trying to like draw attention away from it.

1096
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Oh.

1097
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
Yeah.

1098
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,760
I think we're ending this episode with a thing that made in the specifically most nondescript

1099
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,880
color a topic that's come up in several episodes before.

1100
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
I say bring back the Monorail cafe.

1101
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,640
I think that's what this area really needs.

1102
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,640
I think that's right.

1103
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,040
I think that they've been closing the station a lot for who knows exactly.

1104
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,040
Some people say money.

1105
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,120
Some people say they're trying to figure out how to reformat the track when they do some

1106
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,800
big stuff in Tomorrowland or Fantasyland.

1107
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,360
But it just feels, I don't know, it does feel like a bit of an afterthought.

1108
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Yeah.

1109
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,640
I would like it to feel, it's cool when you go on the Monorail.

1110
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,800
It should be feeling cooler.

1111
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,080
It shouldn't be like you're kind of like, all right, I guess we'll just do this because

1112
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,680
I don't want to walk the whole way.

1113
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,160
I mean, great if you're coming back from the park and you're staying at the Disneyland

1114
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
Hotel.

1115
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Sure.

1116
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
And you just want to get back to the hotel.

1117
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,720
Well, there's one day where it was very cool.

1118
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,760
And that is that it's something that came up down in the underworld preview.

1119
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,640
If you didn't listen to that, here's the kind of thing you were missing out on down

1120
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,640
there.

1121
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,240
We talked about the premiere of Tomorrowland in 2015, star-studded premiere.

1122
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:05,380
And afterwards, the guests all took a Monorail into the park, into the original, the real

1123
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,880
deal Tomorrowland.

1124
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,800
And here is a picture in the Monorail station of George Clooney and Bob Iger in the front

1125
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,080
car of the Monorail.

1126
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,040
Patsuk, your Ithaca boy.

1127
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,040
Yeah.

1128
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,680
And my tequila supplier.

1129
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,680
My Casa Miga.

1130
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,240
Where is Cindy Crawford's husband and George Clooney best friend, Randy Gerber in that

1131
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
photo?

1132
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,120
Is he anywhere to be found?

1133
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,880
I don't see him.

1134
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,440
That's one thing that happened in the underworld.

1135
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,160
Talk of Randy Gerber.

1136
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,480
We've never talked about Randy Gerber, Cindy Crawford's husband before, who's George Clooney's

1137
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,120
tequila partner.

1138
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,960
The picture of them riding motorcycles was used in the advertising so much, I can picture

1139
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,840
it more clearly than some beautiful paintings.

1140
00:49:51,840 --> 00:50:00,520
And of course, Nick Mundy cut off my story about like George Clooney inviting all his

1141
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,780
buddies to his dining room and called them up.

1142
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,600
And there was a suitcase in front of each one of their chair, a briefcase in front of

1143
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,680
each of the chair.

1144
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,760
And everyone opened it up and each briefcase had a million dollars.

1145
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,400
And he's like, now we're all rich.

1146
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,960
You know, now it's like, it's for you.

1147
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960
It's for my friends.

1148
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,960
Like, wow.

1149
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
Hmm.

1150
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
That's great.

1151
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
Yeah.

1152
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,960
I don't know.

1153
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
I think it's a nice story.

1154
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,200
Let's call Mundy up and make sure he hears this.

1155
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,360
Let's like, hey, we were thinking and you need to finish the story.

1156
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,400
Why don't you give him a suitcase full of a million dollars?

1157
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Okay, cool.

1158
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,800
I'll get on that.

1159
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,080
A million dollars in Buffalo Wild Wings cash.

1160
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,080
Wow.

1161
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,360
The current, it converts differently.

1162
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,360
Sure.

1163
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,360
It's not expensive.

1164
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,000
Do we get it?

1165
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,520
I mean, I have some more thoughts about just how Randy Gerber dresses, but I think we could

1166
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,080
probably be done.

1167
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,200
Who knew Randy Gerber would factor so heavily into the Downtown Disney ordeal?

1168
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
No one wanted it.

1169
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Is he the final boss?

1170
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Oh, is he the final boss?

1171
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
He's in the running.

1172
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
Could be.

1173
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Is he the cousin?

1174
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Is he the level keeper?

1175
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
I don't know.

1176
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Randy Gerber.

1177
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:11,440
What if Randy Gerber was a special guest at the end of the Downtown Disney ordeal?

1178
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,760
Jenny Kroever's husband and George Clooney's tequila partner.

1179
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,360
That was the big finale.

1180
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,020
Nick Weigr, not involved.

1181
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,880
Randy Gerber is our guest to talk about the parking garage.

1182
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, I guess I shouldn't even spoil that.

1183
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,300
I guess we cut that out.

1184
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,920
No, no, no, Randy Gerber.

1185
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,560
No Randy Gerber's allowed.

1186
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
Dammit.

1187
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
I think this is it.

1188
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,560
We survived.

1189
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,560
