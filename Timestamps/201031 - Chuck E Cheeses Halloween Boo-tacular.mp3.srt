00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, The Cemetery Gate, a surprise one last bonus, one of these

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,840
that I'm springing on Mike and Jason right now.

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,480
They don't know what the plan is, we're flying blind, but something came up and I had to pull you guys in on it and just put you on the spot.

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,440
Oh my gosh, so wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. So the thing that we've prepared is out the window is what you're saying.

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:52,560
Not entirely, we'll do it and I'll keep this short, this will just be like a little mini bonus thing and I'll take care of it, I'll edit it and throw it up on Patreon.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,520
But I figure, you know, the clock's ticking, we're recording this on Halloween, so what I'm talking about isn't going to be relevant after today.

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:09,040
So I figure we can small talk about this or we could just get it on the air and I think you'll understand the urgency once I present it.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,760
I just want to say either of you can tell me, spring a new episode on me at any time.

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,200
I love the excitement, I don't care if I've prepared, we'll do it another time.

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,520
I love it, I get a little adrenaline high from this, so let's do it, I'm ready.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,280
There's something to it, it's like a positive prank, it's like a prank it forward, there's no victims here.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,240
Exactly.

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:46,320
I think we're all going to benefit, including the audience, and I might as well just dive right in because a couple nights ago I realized that I had to let you guys know about a little event that I guess this might be the last day of it.

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,600
And the event is called Chuck E. Cheese's Halloween Boo-tacular.

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:04,240
So I pulled up the screen here, you're looking at a picture of current Chuck E. Cheese smiling, sort of weird, I don't know how I feel about this smile.

16
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,720
I don't hate him, I don't hate it.

17
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,600
It's a little annoying selfie or something.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,000
But you know, he's in a cape and vampire wings or what have you.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:28,160
But so, it just occurred to me to look, I just put into YouTube Chuck E. Cheese Halloween expecting to find some weird robot show from 25 years ago.

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,480
Instead I discovered they're doing things this year, and this might be a shock because we've heard bad things from this company this year.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
They've filed for bankruptcy, but that doesn't mean they're done.

22
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:53,280
And of course all the ones near us are closed, but across the country, and I know Colorado specifically, I don't know all the other, I didn't look up what's open and what's not.

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,040
But not only are they open, they're trying to pull people back into the fold with a big Boo-tacular event.

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
I mean that's good news, that points the way to the future.

25
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:10,560
There is a future to Chuck E. Cheese, and they present it as the number one safe, family-friendly Halloween celebration in the country.

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Click here to see how much unbelievable fun we're having.

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,040
So among the things that they're offering at this event is a pumpkin pepperoni pizza.

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,540
Okay.

29
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,300
No!

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
Yeah, right, sounds like an abomination doesn't it?

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Even we get treat experimental here, but that doesn't sound right.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
That's a Frankenstein's monster.

33
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,640
I'd try, I'll try a slice.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,760
Well here's what's good, is that it isn't quite what you're thinking.

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,960
I don't think that there is pumpkin as a component, and maybe this is a misleading title,

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,160
because really it should be called I think a Jack-o-lantern pepperoni pizza, because look here it is.

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,120
Oh, okay.

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,640
It's cute, it's a face like a Jack-o-lantern.

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,160
It's a face like a Jack-o-lantern.

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,240
They will take pepperonis and make a border, and then make a spooky smile with little,

41
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,880
not only the pepperoni eyes, but two little olive pupils, and then up at the top they have stretched

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,640
some extra dough up to make it a delicious pumpkin stem.

43
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,880
Stem, like a vestigial tail.

44
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,560
It's weird, with no cheese on it, no pepperoni on it, that's just pure crust up there.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
Just Pasquale's pizza skin tag.

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,920
Maybe the worst phrase ever said on the show.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Really vile.

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Yeah, Jesus.

49
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
So yeah, that's weird.

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,120
There's also a little, let's see, they're offering other stuff like Oreo butacular brownies,

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,400
Dippin' Dots, I scream, like an eye and then a scream, which is something that an eye can't do.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,840
This thing is, okay, so it's chocolate syrup, gummy worms, and a gummy eyeball.

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,280
From the photo, I have to say it looks like one of Bugmane's beloved dirt cups.

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
I also saw it and thought of Bugmane's beloved dirt cup, yes.

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
Yes indeed, Buzz Buzz dirt cup.

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,520
And then, I actually didn't clock this when I was eyeing this page, orange cotton candy.

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,520
There's no further theming or name there, it's just in a bag.

58
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
Doesn't it just look like a bread loaf?

59
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,480
It looks like some sort of a bag you'd find at the hospital they collected by a lot of a human body,

60
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,800
and it doesn't even look like cotton candy, it looks like liquid or something.

61
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like post-lipo.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Your weird fat innards that got removed.

63
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
Exactly what it is.

64
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
You can get your fat removed at a Chuck E. Cheese.

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
I mean, yeah, it's becoming also a makeshift hospital.

66
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,320
Munch performs the surgery on you at a Chuck E. Cheese.

67
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,560
Me Dr. Munch now, pick up day job.

68
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,080
Well, Munch does, actually Munch's other work is really maybe the primary reason I'm bringing this

69
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,600
up. Here you're looking at Mr. Munch's Monster Mashup, which is an event that occurs every

70
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
half hour on the 30 minute mark.

71
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
I'll kind of return to that.

72
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
This treat bags, whatever, whatever.

73
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,600
The thing that really made me want to spring this on you guys is this aspect of the event.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
DJ Munch's glow party.

75
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,180
Wow.

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Wow.

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,880
There's never been a more enticing party I've ever heard in my life.

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,840
When I thought about just calling the episode DJ Munch's glow party, but I figured let that be a

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,880
little surprise in the center of this candy.

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah.

81
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,280
Okay.

82
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,560
On Friday and Saturday nights, the lights go down and DJ Munch turns it up with a mix of high energy

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
music videos to get the party going.

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,040
This is like an extra, this is an upcharge event like Disneyland would have for just $14.99 per

85
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,440
child.

86
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,760
Get 30 minutes of all you can play an upgraded glow treat bag.

87
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120
Upgraded what?

88
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,600
From what?

89
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,640
That includes three glow bracelets.

90
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,800
So this is like, this is a kid's rave.

91
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
This is their plan to get people back in.

92
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
In this germ conscious world.

93
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,520
Yeah.

94
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,240
A little glow in kids raves.

95
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,560
Wow.

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,200
This is great.

97
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,880
I mean, I loved a glow fest at Disney's California Adventure, which, you know,

98
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,720
segued into Tron.

99
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,160
All like very family friendly neon raves.

100
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,600
Yeah.

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:53,040
You know, in general, I think I like that, like attempt at modern reference within themed

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
entertainment.

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,880
Usually it's so wrong and any attempt of theme parks or Chuck E. Cheese or anything to do like

104
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,040
rock music was always real bad.

105
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,240
And I'd say rap too, always sort of a rough go.

106
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,200
I have no real problem with the collision of raves and DJ culture.

107
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Oh yeah.

108
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,640
It's always kind of cute and fun.

109
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,320
The Tron, I really, the Tron party was so odd because they were playing the like very,

110
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,000
very spooky kind of Daft Punk, like instrumental tracks.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,280
And then there would just be guys in Tron outfits just throwing frisbees around and like

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
big creepy chairs.

113
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
Like it was cool.

114
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
It was weird.

115
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,800
Yeah.

116
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,320
Those big, like, I don't know.

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,240
I can't remember the Tron terminology, but they're like the big, they're like the giant

118
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,040
staples that follow you around.

119
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,360
Yeah.

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Those called giant staples, giant staple laser staples.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
But there's one of those at the entrance.

122
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah.

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,800
Those that we should do a whole episode about the Tron party.

124
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,600
Yeah.

125
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,760
And that was just before like, or as the redo of California Adventure started up.

126
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
So it was never super crowded.

127
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,440
Like I remember family visiting once and we were there on a weeknight at like 1130 PM

128
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
and it's just us.

129
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
It's just no one else around except us and some Tron guys.

130
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,560
So you have a, you have time to have a conversation with all the stilt people?

131
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes.

132
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,280
And the Bowie DJ guy?

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,760
Yes.

134
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh, and it was like January and a cold snap had happened.

135
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,560
So it's like 40 degrees outside.

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
And that arcade.

137
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah.

138
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,960
That was, that was all great.

139
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,760
The arcade.

140
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

141
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
I was just looking at photos of Glowfest before Tron.

142
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,760
Do you guys remember?

143
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Oh, I didn't realize that Glowfest was a different.

144
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,640
Yeah.

145
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
Glowfest was a different thing that happened before Tron.

146
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,960
And then of course, after Tron is the Mad Tea Party.

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,240
Yeah.

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,280
So there's a whole trilogy of festivals at California Adventure.

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah.

150
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,960
We call this like, do we theme it all as a month?

151
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,920
It's like, is there a month free that you can insert a race?

152
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,760
Or rave month.

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
It was rave month.

154
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Rock and rave.

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
Because there was rock at the Mad Tea Party, of course.

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
But there was also an element of raving at the Mad Tea Party.

157
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Yes.

158
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,120
Because DJ White Rabbit would of course spin some tunes.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Yeah.

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,400
The band needs a break every now and then.

161
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,640
Yeah.

162
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Alice in the Mad Hatter would take a break and DJ White Rabbit would get everyone pumped.

163
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,360
Well, that might take things right into this.

164
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,520
Because I think now it's time that you see what DJ Munch is all about.

165
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,320
Yes.

166
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
And when I click the other tab, it'll reveal it right away.

167
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,040
DJ Munch appears to be a dead mouse.

168
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
Oh my god.

169
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
Munch now has a big plastic head.

170
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
With an abstract version of his face.

171
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
This is fantastic.

172
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,720
Yes.

173
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
Exactly what I was thinking.

174
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,760
I think this has been a...

175
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
Chuck E. Cheese has been a rough franchise for me lately.

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,520
Like none of it comes close to the robot era.

177
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,800
And this is kind of the first thing where I'm like, I think they're cracking it.

178
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
I think they're paving a path to the future.

179
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,200
This is good.

180
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,320
Yeah.

181
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,820
Agreed.

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,400
DJ Munch is sure to get your toes tapping as he performs a special DJ mashup

183
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,440
of some of our favorite Chuck E. songs.

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,840
Wow.

185
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Now get ready for this mega mix of Chuck E. classy.

186
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,920
And I think you'll be pretty pleased with where this goes.

187
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,560
All right.

188
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,440
I have a guess, but go ahead.

189
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,640
DJ Munch, take it away.

190
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Jesus, hanging with my friends.

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,520
Hop out of bed like a kangaroo.

192
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,160
I just make it through all the morning things I got to do.

193
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I brush my teeth till I get them both shiny.

194
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,520
Just soak it in the bath tub, it's where you're gonna find me fresh.

195
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,800
The song we love so much, Another Chuck E. Day.

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,440
Yeah.

197
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,400
Now remixed into, I guess, their version of 24K Magic.

198
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,120
Yes.

199
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
That's really good.

200
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,920
Yeah.

201
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
And then you've edited Munch in there instead of Chuck.

202
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,400
Yeah.

203
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
And so what am I look?

204
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,840
Is this rendered or is this actually a practical?

205
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,960
I can't figure that out.

206
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
I think it is practical, right?

207
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,400
This is a puppet situation, I believe.

208
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
The way that they do things.

209
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,760
At the beginning, there's kind of a setup where he's regular Munch

210
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
and then he pulls this helmet on.

211
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay.

212
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
And the glow of the eyes light up.

213
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,080
Kind of looks like Marshmallow, the one, the very popular DJ nowadays.

214
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,560
Yeah.

215
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,360
It's kind of got a little Marshmallow vibe.

216
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
But yes, Def Pop definitely too.

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,520
God, this is the first new Chuck E. character I would buy a toy of.

218
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,680
Big time.

219
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,840
I would buy new DJ Munch.

220
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,600
I want high quality figures of all the classic looks for Chuck E. Cheese.

221
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
They've never made them, but I would buy this.

222
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
This is fantastic.

223
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Yeah.

224
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,640
I wonder if they will or is there even just like a,

225
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,680
you know what this would be great for?

226
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Not that anyone uses these anymore, but like antenna toppers for their cars.

227
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,440
Oh, yeah.

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,680
Yeah.

229
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,320
Oh, yeah.

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,440
Jack in the box.

231
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,320
Yeah.

233
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,960
Yeah.

234
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,680
Right on.

235
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
It looks just like that.

236
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,520
It's like as clean as Jack's head.

237
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
I like it aesthetically.

238
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,760
I think they have nailed it.

239
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,120
I'm so happy to give praise to Chuck E. Cheese.

240
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,200
It feels like it's been a while and I think they're doing great here.

241
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah.

242
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,920
I need to have a kid.

243
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,480
I got to get to this party.

244
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,400
I said I got to have a kid to get to this party.

245
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,120
Oh, now you?

246
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,520
I wasn't going to do it before.

248
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
This is what's going to push over the edge.

249
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
But I got to have an excuse to get to this rave.

250
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,400
Yeah.

251
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
Well, and by the time all that would play out, you know,

252
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,400
then it might be vaguely safe to be in a Chuck E. Cheese again

253
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,720
if they don't all close anyway before that is possible.

254
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,200
Can we join like Bain Capital or something and somehow get the rights

255
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,480
to Chuck E. Cheese when they go bankrupt so we can control the franchise?

256
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,800
That sounds like a better plan for us than, you know,

257
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,880
than being podcasters.

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,200
I mean, in a lot of ways, I think.

259
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,760
For sure.

260
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,520
That would be better for us.

261
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:29,680
Yeah.

262
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,040
PTR, we just established a private equity firm, PTR Private Equity.

263
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, sure.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,040
We just scoop up all of these like IPs that are struggling.

265
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Yeah, that's what we should do.

266
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
We've been talking about this for years.

267
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,520
That's how we do it.

268
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,560
That's the way to do it.

269
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
This laundry list of things we want to buy.

270
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,600
That's the way.

271
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,840
So then we don't then we then we're presenting ourselves to like the crooks

272
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,000
who run the six flags or whatever.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,520
Now suddenly we get a meeting because they see equity in the name.

274
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,760
Right.

275
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,280
Like, oh, yes, so we must meet them.

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,680
Yes.

277
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,800
Any equity people.

278
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,760
This is make children leave.

279
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,400
Get out of here.

280
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,960
We want to talk.

281
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,560
You need to talk to these equity folks.

282
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
This is worth investigating to see how easy this would be to set up.

283
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,720
I know we could get dark money backing theme parks are huge,

284
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,440
very popular in the Middle East and China.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200
There is money going around out there, you know?

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,400
Also, doesn't that need to be like the future of our show in general?

287
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,320
Like, I think we need to like whenever travel is possible again,

288
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
maybe we can get like work visas.

289
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
Maybe we can justify it with our equity firm.

290
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
Like they'll let us take planes.

291
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,080
And we because like nothing new is getting built anymore in America.

292
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,440
I think it's becoming clear.

293
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,400
So we have to go to China, to UAE and all these places.

294
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,760
And that's how I think we're going to get like another couple of years of life on the show

295
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,280
is by maybe just do we just have to move to Dubai?

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,240
Yeah.

297
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,640
General.

298
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,080
And every day Jason can climb the building like Tom Cruise.

299
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,880
Like Tom Cruise.

300
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,640
In Mission Impossible 4.

301
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
It's his commute.

302
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,420
Yeah.

303
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,180
Every there's probably like a new theme park on every floor.

304
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,060
Like monthly they're opening a new floor of an indoor skyscraper theme park.

305
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,460
Yeah, that's the way that's sustained this.

306
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,260
And you can bet I will develop some sort of impenetrable accent like Lindsay Lohan

307
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,300
when she was hired to be a tourism ambassador for Turkey.

308
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,340
I never heard that, but I know exactly what you're talking about.

309
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,620
Like, yeah, this this new bizarre.

310
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,380
I mean, in the way that Madonna pioneered the unplaceable accent that combines 20 accents.

311
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,260
Johnny Depp, of course, also has that accent.

312
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,700
Oh, you're right.

313
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,260
Where you're like, you're not you're an American guy.

314
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,580
This is what it's what Krasinski is going to sound like in like 10 months.

315
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,860
It's like real close to the confusing.

316
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,180
Yeah.

317
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,660
Hello.

318
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,060
Hello.

319
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,460
I'm John Krasinski.

320
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,180
That's maybe even too on the nose, honestly.

321
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,620
That's too English.

322
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,220
That's not not vague enough.

323
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,780
You have to make it not lean any direction.

324
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,180
Hello.

325
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,580
Doesn't fall into 20 categories.

326
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,380
It's very difficult.

327
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,580
John Krasinski.

328
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,700
John Krasinski.

329
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,300
Just keep practicing.

330
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,780
Yeah, I'll work on it.

331
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,980
Just say the name 100 times.

332
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,580
John Krasinski.

333
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,900
Anyway, the the last component of this is just here to go to go backwards to.

334
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,260
It's confusing because DJ Munch's glow party.

335
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,180
That's only Fridays and Saturdays.

336
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,580
Every day all day, there's Mr. Munch's Monster Mashup featuring Chuck E's Bootastic Dance.

337
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,060
For this, they seem to have teamed up with another one of our great franchises, Kidz Bop.

338
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,220
They've there's a whole block you can watch of Kidz Bop, Chuck E Cheese combo music videos

339
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,980
where they do things that we like like Monster Mash and I forget what else, you know, they do.

340
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,260
This is Halloween from Nightmare Before Christmas.

341
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:20,900
But what really sparked me was Chuck E beginning his bootastic dance with which they put up in

342
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,700
full quality.

343
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,860
And here's a real sign of the time.

344
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,180
This is Halloween 2020 Encapsulated.

345
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,100
Let's give each other enough space spread out at least six feet apart and let's dance.

346
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,820
Follow me.

347
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,420
Just slap your arms like a bad ass.

348
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,900
That was that.

349
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I was watching that with Aaron, my wife, who said that was where she stopped and was like,

350
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,780
children are going to be so fucked up from this for so many years.

351
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,460
Like you'll be describing to a therapist way down the road.

352
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,620
And then I just then Chuck E Cheese said I have to stay six feet apart.

353
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,460
And if I was too close to if I was close enough to touch anyone that I had to step away.

354
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,340
Yes, I've heard this from people with young children.

355
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,300
This is a problem.

356
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,580
Yeah.

357
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,080
Yeah.

358
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,100
I'm really happy my baby doesn't know what's going on.

359
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,540
But at the current rate, will he live his entire childhood in this?

360
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,940
You might have time to learn.

361
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,420
It's pot.

362
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,900
Who knows?

363
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,300
We'll see.

364
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:45,460
I think it's all vaccine based at this point because the whole everybody be good to each other

365
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,660
ain't going to work too good.

366
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,860
That we're all in this together.

367
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,780
You know, just a few more unwatchable Zoom TV shows or Zoom reunions.

368
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,140
It's just it's going to be great.

369
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,460
We're going to loop around.

370
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,940
Everything will have reunited like five times.

371
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,540
It'll be the fifth annual.

372
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,040
Yeah.

373
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,300
Hello, I'm John Krasinski.

374
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,860
Good to see the office cast again for the fifth.

375
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,380
Again, too British.

376
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,180
It's tough.

377
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,900
Yeah, it's tough.

378
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,780
Yeah, it's really hard.

379
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,860
That was a that was very depth ish.

380
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,180
Yeah.

381
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,340
Yeah.

382
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,660
Yeah.

383
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,940
I mean, that's good as the base.

384
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,500
But yeah, if you can somehow take the British out, take the English off it.

385
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah.

386
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,880
Anyway, so this is great.

387
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,800
I mean, if you're hearing this when this is hopefully up on on Halloween later today,

388
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,080
as we record this and you're looking for Halloween activities to do and you are in

389
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,400
one of the states where the governor hasn't demanded the Chuck E. Cheese be closed.

390
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,600
And if you were if you have a child, so they'll let you in.

391
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,360
And if you're willing to take the germ risk for you and your child,

392
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,800
you got to check out the bootastic.

393
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,760
Dracula.

394
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,760
Yeah, I just realized that a lot of these videos you can watch at home with your kids,

395
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,800
but half of this web page is encouraging encouraging you like come in and get the

396
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,160
Halloween food and the Halloween deals to enjoy inside, not to get to go.

397
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,840
You can get them to go, but don't you want to do it here inside the store?

398
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,480
Yeah.

399
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,080
And do you?

400
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,640
I don't know.

401
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,880
I don't really know if you want your kid playing in a ball pit right now with other kids.

402
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,520
I mean, potentially not ever.

403
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:27,960
Well, right.

404
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,040
I mean, ball pits are tough.

405
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,080
And also, again, I'm not like, you know, I'm not being around a bunch of other,

406
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,200
you know, babies of my baby's age.

407
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,040
I imagine that the risk if you're a two or three year old,

408
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,840
if you're if you're raising a two or three year old, like they get sick all the time

409
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,960
and then you get sick.

410
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,600
I mean, for like for sure, for the next six months, any type of sick that anyone gets,

411
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,640
everyone will immediately assume it is the coronavirus.

412
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,760
Even if it is just like a mild cough for a little bit.

413
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,280
I know I'm feeling this way.

414
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,400
Like, yeah, like my voice is slightly raspy, probably because I did a podcast or something.

415
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,760
And I'm like, well, that's it.

416
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,480
Head into death.

417
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,360
Wherever it's so paranoid.

418
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,800
But if it if you get it at Chuck E. Cheese, it's technically clarified as classified as a

419
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,920
lul spreader event, just a little spreader.

420
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,640
Just a cute little spreader.

421
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,120
Well, you know, Munch has been performing liposuction, so he's some kind of a doctor now.

422
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,560
So he wouldn't allow this if it wasn't safe.

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,560
That's true.

424
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:40,600
Trump's undermining Dr. Munch, though, say it's a kickback from all of the fat sucking.

425
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,200
Munch is Trump's top doctor.

426
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,440
Mr. Munch.

427
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,280
That's his health advisor.

428
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,840
It's this guy.

429
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,680
Sloppy Pasquale's pizza is no longer hot.

430
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,000
I tell you what, I like Dr. Munch.

431
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,920
I just wish he'd take that helmet off.

432
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,520
It's a little what's he scared of?

433
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,720
It's a little politically correct.

434
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,400
Oh, come on, let me kiss you.

435
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,760
I want to kiss you, Munch.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,680
I'm going to come up on that stage and kiss you.

437
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Trump, of course, famously posed with Grimace.

438
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,360
Yeah, oh, that's great.

439
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,720
A lot of folks probably think Munch is a ripoff of Grimace.

440
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,000
And maybe he is.

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,500
Maybe.

442
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,120
Maybe they stole Munch from Grimace.

443
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,920
Should have changed the color and they could have gotten away with it.

444
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,760
Yeah, it seems like they should have changed the color.

445
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,520
That would have been an easy, easy fix.

446
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,320
But why purple is the best color?

447
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,520
So I guess I get it.

448
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,880
Oh, yeah.

449
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,880
And as a fan of purple, I mean, you must love seeing a really nicely polished,

450
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,040
the Disneyland plastic that we love.

451
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,400
Yeah, this helmet is the best thing they've done in a decade.

452
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,280
I think the helmet could single-handedly save Chuck E. Cheese.

453
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,040
Wow, I agree.

454
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,960
Was the rest of the set just as fire?

455
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
That's the most that I saw.

456
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,040
I have to tell you.

457
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,760
I flipped right to the middle and was so happy to hear our favorite song.

458
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
We could hear how it ends if you're curious.

459
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,840
Maybe he could play us out and we could react real quick and move on to the one we're supposed to do.

460
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,200
Which, hint, also involves the color purple.

461
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,760
We'll tease.

462
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
OK, let's see how much it is.

463
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,520
Not the movie, the actual color.

464
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,080
It's not about, no, we'll take that one off the table.

465
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,000
And there was never a themed experience based on the color purple.

466
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,440
Welcome to podcast the ride.

467
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,360
We're talking the Oprah Winfrey film, the color purple today.

468
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,920
The color purple, ride it out.

469
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,040
All right, let's there's the last 20 seconds.

470
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,080
Hell yeah.

471
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,040
Thank you very much.

472
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,360
I hate your pizza.

473
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,860
He said.

474
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,220
Wow.

475
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,640
Wow.

476
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,080
Do we point out the munch amps?

477
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,580
I forget.

478
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,240
Oh, we didn't.

479
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

480
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,760
He's got that.

481
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah, like the classic speaker font.

482
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,440
I forget what style, what brand that's parodying.

483
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,880
But Marshall.

484
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,960
Oh, yeah, I think so.

485
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,200
Yeah.

486
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
Marshall stacks.

487
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,640
Munch amps.

488
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,960
And they light up to this rules.

489
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,760
Check this out.

490
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,620
Yeah.

491
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,240
Oh, wait, comments are turned off.

492
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,760
I was going to say, leave a comment saying,

493
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,040
I guess the right thing.

494
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,800
What was this controversial?

495
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,680
Probably.

496
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,200
Probably so kids don't see the hate that's on the internet.

497
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,440
Yeah, maybe all kid video comments are turned off and we should be.

498
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,960
All right.

499
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,400
Well, yeah, good.

500
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,440
Don't ruin the purity of DJ Munch, our new favorite thing.

501
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,520
Wow.

502
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,920
Well, I'm so glad to have shared this little mini episode for you.

503
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,160
And yeah, have a have a bootastic rest of your Halloween, which has several

504
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,880
hours remaining as you're hearing this.

505
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Go to Chuck E. Cheese if you're not scared.

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,840
Happy Halloween.
