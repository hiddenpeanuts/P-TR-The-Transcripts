1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The podcast you knew

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is dead.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
From its ashes rises

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a hauntcast

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
full of psychopaths,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
dolls who do Rickle-style burns,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and weird little guys.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No late arrivals will be

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
admitted, for shocking twists

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
await. For example,

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Jason talks about seeing a bunch of

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
old office chairs.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guess I spoiled that one, but there's more to come.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Chelsea Rebecca from

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dead Meat joins us to talk

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Universal's storied history

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with Norman Bates

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
on Hauntcast the Fright!

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Welcome, foolish mortals,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to Hauntcast the Fright!

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A masterful work of

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
suspense which we hope gets remade

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
38 years from now.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Precisely the same, but with more

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
masturbation. I'm

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the Garewolf!

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And joined for this Hauntcast

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
season by...

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, a spiky snarl gun.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Gun, snarl gun. I really

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
screwed it up, cause like,

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
ugh, I'm so embarrassed, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It wouldn't be the Hauntcast

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the Fright! month if there wasn't a lot

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of hemming and hawing about the names.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If we just set them confidently and moved

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
on, that's not what we do.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We get caught in the brambles on

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
these, and we'll see if the next guy

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
gets caught in the brambles, his name is...

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Jackal Skeridan.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Jackal Skeridan's wonderful. Yeah, thank you.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It only took seven years and I started

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
writing them down, so I would

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
remember. It doesn't become

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
like, oh, uh, uh, oh.

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But I look forward to every year

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
when Mike, uh, on every episode

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is like, ah, shit.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Trying to remember.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Try to keep it that way, try to keep, uh,

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
not getting them right. Yes, we are kicking off

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
yet another Hauntcast, the Fright! season.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We got a lot of fun in store all

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
October, and I really like where we're kicking things

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
off today, because we are joined by

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
a true horror head, and

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
from The Sounds of it, a big theme park head as well,

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from the Dead Meat podcast

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and YouTube channel. It's Chelsea Rebecca.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hi! Yes, if you look closely

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
in the background of this podcast,

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you can see me, uh, out of a window

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
walking my dogs by, like,

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Alfred Hitchcock. Yes.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My spooky cameo appearance.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for having me. Absolutely.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thanks for making a cameo and a

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
full appearance as well.

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And not only that, I mean,

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
so excited you're here. Thank you for reaching out.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm so happy to meet you.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then, and what a great arrival, too,

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
that you wore the shirt, which is

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
my exciting eBay

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
purchase. Um, I

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
can't believe I already found

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
an appropriate occasion on which to

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
wear it. I have a Psycho

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
1998 promotional giveaway

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
t-shirt that someone

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
on eBay is trying to get rid of

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
lots of them, so

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
check it out. Yeah, they come in every

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
size, and you can tell that

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
some marketing department made them, and

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
no one wanted them. Okay.

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is not a thing. There is nostalgia.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Somehow nostalgia has not accrued for

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
98, exact remake.

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I just saw somebody try to dig

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
up a little enthusiasm for, like,

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you know what, 98 was, like, one

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
like tweet or something that I feel like

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
somebody was like, hey, hey everybody,

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
didn't we actually like this thing? It was probably

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
me. Maybe it was.

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Maybe it was.

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This movie's number one fan.

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And this is, you were saying this is a

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
runner on your podcast. It is. It's been a

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
runner basically since the beginning

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
of our show, since, like, 2017,

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
18. I don't know how

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
it started. Actually,

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
no, I do remember. I was playing a

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
game where I was reading my husband taglines

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
from, like, horror posters

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and making him guess what they were.

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I read the Psycho

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
98 tagline, which is the

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
same, and was like, oh, that's incorrect.

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's technically the 1998. And so it

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
just became a runner

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to kind of, like,

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
break his winning streak in games, just

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
slip in the 98 Psycho.

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's no way to know. He's right.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Psycho 98,

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
when I was 13, 14,

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and we rented it

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
because we were a big Hitchcock

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
family. Like, everyone could agree

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
on Hitchcock. My mom

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
really liked Hitchcock.

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And this

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
is not the actor

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I wrote down that I was

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
excited about. But in that

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
movie, the private detective in 98

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
is William H. Macy.

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And that was a very weird

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
14-year-old thing. That was like,

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
look, it's William H. Macy.

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You mean, like, you were so excited? I was so excited.

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But did you think it was weird

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
he was in there because, like, you had just

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
discovered him? No, I think it was

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
weird that a 14-year-old in the

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
year, like, 1999

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
or 2000 had that much

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
enthusiasm about William H. Macy's

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
career. I bet

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that I had a similar

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
enjoyment of William H. Macy

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and awareness, I will say.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know that it was such an anomaly.

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't want to make you feel less special. I'm not trying

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to do that. I'm just saying that

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mystery Men's around this time.

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He was out there. Boogie Nights. Mystery Men was

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
great. I was also, like,

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
very into David Mamet's

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
filmography, which

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
looking back is very hit and miss.

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But William H. Macy shows

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
up in a lot of those. Sure. Philip Baker

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hall. I didn't know until

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hall's terrific. I hadn't seen, he does

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the, he's the psychiatrist scene

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
at the end.

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Right, or is that Forster?

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wait, now I'm going crazy. Oh, yeah, I

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
forget. Are they both in it?

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What, Robert Forster? Yeah.

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I forget if Robert Forster's in it.

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh my gosh, maybe I'm not the number one

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
psychiatrist. You still could be.

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's true, I still could be.

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't think we have time to hear

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
my Robert Forster. Yeah, Robert

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Forster is Dr. Simon Richmond.

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, he's the end character. I thought that. Oh, and then

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Philip Baker Hall's the sheriff. That's

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
what it is. Okay, okay. Sargam

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Tangled. Excited they're both in there. Both great. You

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
have a Robert Forster story? I do

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
have a Robert Forster story. Is the story going to be, we

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
were a big Robert Forster family and then

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
he was in the movie. It is not.

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I have not

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
one, but two autographed

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
headshots of Robert Forster

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
because he did not

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
like his signature on the first one.

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He did it again?

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My old landlord

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
was a floral designer

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
at a flower shop

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and the owner of it

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
was dating Robert Forster towards

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the end of his life.

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How do I not know this?

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She mentioned it

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
at one point and I was like,

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
oh my god, I love her for Forster.

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I didn't

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
get a letter opener because that was his

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
thing. He always gave letter openers out.

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But he signed a headshot when

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I didn't like it. He didn't like

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
his signature so he signed another

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
headshot and he gave her both

207
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
of them. So I have two

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Jason Robert Forster

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
headshots. That's so sweet.

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I love him. Jackie Brown is

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
one of my favorites. It's in my top three.

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Do you have them

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
framed? Where are they? I don't have them

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
framed. I think I just have it with

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a file with some art

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and some other photographs.

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It would be fun to frame the mistake

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
actually.

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You saw his process. You saw a

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
great actor's process at work.

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Absolutely.

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Chelsea, excited

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and we'll focus

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
on Norman Bates and

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
all things Psycho here as it relates

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to Universal Studios, the theme park. But also

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you're big into Halloween

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Horror Nights and I'm not sure

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
about the other one but I know that you were

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
up there and have done

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for many years a red carpet appearance

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
like you live stream

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
the Halloween Horror Nights red carpet. This year was

234
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
our first red carpet that we

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
live streamed

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and it was the year that it was

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
107 degrees outside

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
so a lot of people were not

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
they were because we

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
were located right next to

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the AMC at

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
City Walk where they had the doors

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
just slightly propped open so you could feel

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that it was cold in there and I think

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
by the time people got to where we were they

246
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
were like oh but that

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can tell it's real cold in there. They would

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
just kind of whoop. I'm sorry. Whoever

249
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you are you're not air conditioning. Yeah. John Carpenter

250
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll allow it. He walked by

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
us just flashing peace signs like

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
hey thanks guys. I gotta go

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
home and play Sonic or whatever.

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's getting up there

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it's great we still have

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
them you don't want them to whatever

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
makes you comfortable. We've been fortunate to interview

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
him before and it was

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
awesome. We did we barely talked about movies

260
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
we talked about video games and the

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
economic situation

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
of Detroit because I said I was from

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Detroit and he was like oh what's going on

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
there like what's tell me about

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
it. Okay.

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's really cool.

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's great. I was shocked to see him like on

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the red carpet horror. Yes.

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He got out of the house for this. Wow.

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's cool. Got those

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
music royalties. Yeah.

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He was there with his wife Sandy.

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Like did he go through a house.

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you think. I doubt it. I doubt it

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
right. But like why why not.

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
At least get ushered through

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
it before everyone goes.

278
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How were how was everyone

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
spirits at a hundred and seven

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
degrees at Horror Nights because I've watched some

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
live streams and people still

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
seem to be having fun. Yeah like

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
surprisingly everyone was

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know what no one seemed cranky.

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think it was a I think it was just so

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
nasty out that it became like a

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
oh we're all in this together kind of thing.

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You know it kind of

289
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
went past that point of the

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
bell curve like it was past miserable

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
into like well you know we're all here

292
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
let's just have fun.

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Help each other. Yeah.

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Not I saw that they weren't you couldn't

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
bring your own water bottles in.

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Universal was not in the team spirit

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
as much as the people there.

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think since we were media we were

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
able to. Okay good. But that's

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
actually kind of crazy.

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Especially since I did see someone

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
being attended to who I presume

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
had like a heat stroke or something.

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh yeah I saw that happen at

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Disneyland the week prior too.

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
On Pixar Pier someone hit the

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
deck. Yeah and fair warning

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
if you're going when it's this hot out

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
this is coming out a bit later so I think

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
hopefully it's better by now.

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Some of the houses are hotter on the inside

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and I just I feel so

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
bad for those actors like the Ghostbusters

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
house which we were excited

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
for because it's oh it's Ghostbusters frozen empire.

316
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It'll be cold in there.

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right.

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's so sweltering.

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's kind of what I thought too.

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Mike Scollins made a joke to that effect.

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I was like that is true

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
at least there'll be there'll be a cooling

323
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
effect. Why did we think that?

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't know that I fully believe that but I

325
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
was like oh maybe there'll be a room or two where they have

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
some sort of like a freezer open. There is

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
one maze we went through we didn't go

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
through all of them we tapped out it was just it was too much.

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But there was one we went through where it's

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
this it's on IP it's like

331
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
this radioactive zombie

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
kind of maze.

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's by the mummy ride

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think it's kind of tucked away in a corner but

335
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
that room you walk through at one point and

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it's a freezer with a bunch of bodies

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
hanging up and that room is actually cold

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
so if you're looking for somewhere

339
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to get just a few minutes

340
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of respite.

341
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's the freezer in the radioactive zombie

342
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
maze. You should try to hide like hug a

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
corpse in there and like hide.

344
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Meanwhile

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the evening weather in Orlando

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I've been looking is usually

347
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the mid to low 70s.

348
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's very pleasant.

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You check the weather in Orlando every night you know.

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have like eight or ten

351
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
cities saved in my weather app.

352
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You stare out at the moon and think about what it looks like

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
in Orlando every night. Yeah

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
like a Fievels situation.

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm like on the windowsill

356
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and you like transport to the

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
windowsill of the Islands of Adventure

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
White House.

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Their scare zones are under the same roof.

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is a little

361
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
validating what you've said

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
in terms of the heat at least

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
at the beginning of the season which is a while ago

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
as listeners hearing this but

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you were there up there for the first night.

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The second night

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Mike and I were set to go.

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Tickets were arranged

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and I was going to brave

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
it for the first time because last

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
last year's haunt cast was the

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
first that I've participated in anything.

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think what got me over the hump

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
was that the things that we did were so

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
stupid that the names

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
themselves are so dumb.

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We did a haunted car wash.

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We did Shaqtoberfest.

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was so delighted by

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
oh even you know what we didn't end up doing an episode

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
about I went our friend

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Joe Quazzala I followed him to the

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
LA Haunted Hayride in

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Griffith Park which has something that he's a big

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
fan of a zombie lounge singer

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
named Monte Rivolta.

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I watched Monte Rivolta's set.

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No real scares beyond that

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
other than the general

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
eeriness of just the vibe of Monte

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Rivolta.

392
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But anyway all of these things made me like

393
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
last year's for sure my favorite

394
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
October my favorite like Halloween

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
season doing the show or not. So I was

396
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
a little bit like this time

397
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
think I'm ready Mike get me in.

398
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Then it was the night before

399
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the night you were up there and I was like

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Mike hate to say it. I don't

401
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
know if I can because like I'm

402
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
teetering as it is. I'm a scaredy cat.

403
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was like I think I can make it.

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But you add that heat to it.

405
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I was like too many things.

406
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm an adult. I don't need to do this.

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So it's been

408
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
rescheduled.

409
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And this is maybe

410
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the element of suspense of the

411
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
month in general. Will I Scott

412
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
do anything.

413
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Was the year enough to reset me

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and make me will I find an excuse

415
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that isn't heat. Was that me making

416
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
an excuse to not do

417
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
it or was it. I mean it was

418
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
so horrible. It was horrible.

419
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I have all these questions

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
too though. I said well when it's

421
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
15 degrees what will it be something

422
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
else. I don't know. I don't know the answer myself.

423
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't know the answer. I don't know what I'm going to do.

424
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm excited to find out. I'm excited

425
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
to see what it is. And listeners

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
yeah that's something we'll have to wait all month and

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
check to find out. We at least need to do the and we didn't

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
get a chance to do this when we went. We're

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
planning on going again also. But there is

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
a Chucky lie

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
where he roasts everyone.

432
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I want to see it so bad.

433
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You didn't do it. No we did not do it.

434
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Late night with Chucky in

435
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
like the DreamWorks theater.

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The Kung Fu Panda. It was great.

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We interviewed Zachary

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Arthur on the red carpet. We've

439
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
talked to him before. It was our first time meeting him in person.

440
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He's one of the actors on the Chucky

441
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
show. Like he's the lead

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
on that show. We asked like are you going to go

443
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
do that the Chucky live

444
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
roast thing. He was like

445
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that's my job. Like I get paid to

446
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
have Chucky insult me all day.

447
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There's nothing he can say anymore.

448
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He said too much Chucky at work. I understand.

449
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah. Yeah. Thick skin.

450
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Wow. Wow. So yeah.

451
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We'll see if Chucky will roast Scott.

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. If it was Chuck-O it's the whole other

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
thing. That does

454
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
help me. I would like to say

455
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
because there's nothing about me going that says that

456
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
then I have to do all of the scariest

457
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
things. You can just enjoy the ambiance.

458
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Jason and I should take bets on

459
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
how long you last.

460
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll say the. We'll figure that off.

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The houses that we

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
did. We did the Ghostbusters house.

463
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We did the Universal

464
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Monsters house which we called Oops

465
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
All Women because it's all women.

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Like it's Bride of Frankenstein.

467
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a female descendant of Van Helsing

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and they're like road tripping and killing

469
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
female monsters. It's cool as hell.

470
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And this

471
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
might interest you. Might tip you in favor

472
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
of going through that one at least.

473
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I think for the first time ever that

474
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
they have a maze on stage

475
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
two. Is it twelve?

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Where they filmed the original

477
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Frankenstein. Bride of Frankenstein.

478
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
A bunch of the old Universal. Which is why they

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
have the Universal Monsters in there this year.

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Which I think is really really cool.

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That is cool. That's the big one.

482
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
From my tour guide days I remember

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that was the first one you could see and it had the most

484
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
exciting montage I could play.

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Because some stages honestly not a lot

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
interesting happened in. Yeah.

487
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But that one it's like you're playing the montage and it's

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
like it's alive. Say hello

489
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to my little friend. Yep.

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They have a scar. Roar dinosaur.

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
T-rex attack. That was

492
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
a good one. You get down the hill and then you

493
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
hype everybody up with the coolest stage.

494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Granted you only see a corner of it.

495
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's the end of that.

496
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I would like to go on stage twelve.

497
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Wow wow interesting.

498
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I won't say it

499
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
now but there's a spoiler from Ghostbusters

500
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Maze that I actually am like oh why

501
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
did it get spoiled for me. There's a

502
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
good spoiler. And I think you

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
know what it is. I know what it is.

504
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I was like oh that would have been fun. But I won't say

505
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
again we have to go. You have to go. I don't want

506
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you. You'll probably go oh yeah okay.

507
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Our favorite was The Weeknd.

508
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And it was our favorite

509
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
because this is the second time he's done a house

510
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and the first time he did a house it was also

511
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
our favorite that year. It just

512
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
visually it's always so different

513
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
than everything else. And there's so much

514
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
color and the sound is always

515
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
incredible. And it was The Maze I got the most

516
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
genuinely scared in. I got

517
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
caught off guard by so many. There's lots of like

518
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
unexpected changes in scale

519
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
in that one that I think are really cool.

520
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Uh oh. That's the. Yeah you have to suck me out of it.

521
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I did actually think of this show

522
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because there are certain points where it's like there's

523
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
a big thing in a room and I remember

524
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that coming up. You know this thing.

525
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I do know the thing. That's my thing.

526
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That was yours okay. And genuinely scary. No

527
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you've just sucked me out of The Weeknd Maze.

528
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There's a weekend bar that can give you

529
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
courage to go on The Weeknd Maze.

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm all the way in on The Weeknd bar. You can always just ride the

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
rides because they don't have lines during horror nights.

532
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah that too. Yeah yeah.

533
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Me being there at all counts as

534
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
something. You can get into Toad Cafe easily apparently.

535
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We had friends the same night just walk in.

536
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's a good idea.

537
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I would like to have an okay something

538
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
shaped like a Mario thing.

539
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Not for it to be the most

540
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
joyless cafeteria

541
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that feels like

542
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it's a disaster situation

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and we can get everybody fed at least.

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There's an air of panic and stress

545
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
in every corner of the room.

546
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah alright well there's a lot to look forward to.

547
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well thank you

548
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
for this preview of it.

549
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And in terms

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
of the main thing to talk about

551
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think this is a great thing.

552
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is a great slice to take.

553
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A slice I didn't even intend for any pun there.

554
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Of like

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Universal's history.

556
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Of like the big cred.

557
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I feel like in a horror sense

558
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to the back lot area

559
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in general.

560
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The presence of Norman Bates.

561
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The Bates Motel and the Psycho

562
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
House. This is a great thing to like peel off

563
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
as its own thing.

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Was there anything that particularly

565
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
drew you to that as kind of an area

566
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to meditate on? I just think because

567
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
like living in LA

568
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you know it's a city where like

569
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
LA tends to destroy a lot of its own

570
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
history. You know it's almost like

571
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the theme park, the Disney problem where it's like

572
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
this is a business

573
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
ultimately. And so do

574
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you prioritize the museum

575
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
aspect or do you prioritize the

576
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
like new and exciting aspect?

577
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And so it's rare I think

578
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
for giant set pieces

579
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
like that to survive for so

580
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
long. That's not just in like

581
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
a private collectors

582
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
like it's there. Like if you go to the park

583
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
it's there for you to enjoy. And during

584
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
horror nights if you take the tram

585
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
tour you can get up super close.

586
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Which I think is reason enough

587
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to do the tram tour. You walk right alongside

588
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
the Bates Motel and you can get

589
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
your picture taken with Norman on the steps

590
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
of the house. Wow. Yeah.

591
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Absolutely. I got yelled at last

592
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
year because I accidentally stepped on the step.

593
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh yeah. My husband also I think

594
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
got scolded for doing that. It's

595
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
tempting. I didn't do it on purpose

596
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
also. I just like I don't remember I was trying to get in position

597
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
for the photo. Yeah it's Norman. He's

598
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
a nice young man. You want to? I just want to take a photo

599
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
with a nice young man.

600
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's very polite. Sure. Buttoned up.

601
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah absolutely

602
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and it's also like it's sort of

603
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I mean plenty of things have

604
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
shot there over the

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
years but it's not the same as

606
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you leave up the back to the future

607
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
set and other things

608
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
can re-appropriate that

609
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and give it different. Psycho is sort

610
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
of psycho. Yeah. It's

611
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
too iconic to read. It's clearly the psycho

612
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
house. Yes the clock tower

613
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
from back to it's like that

614
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
has been used so many other times.

615
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah. But the psycho house

616
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
if you ever see it in other stuff

617
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
it's there to be the psycho house.

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't know if you saw Maxine

619
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but there's a scene in that where

620
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
they specifically drive

621
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
up to the house in a golf cart

622
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and they're like they shot psycho

623
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
it's just this moment where they're kind of in awe

624
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
of this thing and

625
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
yeah she sees

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
an image of Pearl

627
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
in the window kind of like Mrs. Bates

628
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
at school. Oh I see I see. Another

629
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
aspect of the experience that they

630
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
leave Mother

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
up there in the window.

632
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
No it's a neat like

633
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
it's a cool

634
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
like I'm

635
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
flashing back to being

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a kid and taking the tram tour

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and not at a point where I haven't seen

638
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
psycho I just know culturally

639
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and from Simpsons parodies what

640
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
psychoanima from like I'll never see it.

641
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But I

642
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
it's cool that just kind of

643
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
two facades

644
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
have

645
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
an eerie feel that stays

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
with you

647
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
where there is no tech right.

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's not of course King Kong and Earthquake

649
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
are going to give you a feeling and scare you

650
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and Jaws is going to jump out at you but

651
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
just that like architecture

652
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
is scary to drive by.

653
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah it's kind of it is funny

654
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
now that I think about it that that still

655
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
exists on the tram

656
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
tour where as like other

657
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
stuff they've added and the

658
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
psycho hotel or motel

659
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and house have outlived like

660
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the briefly I remember the

661
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Fast and Furious like the cars

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
on the kooka arms do you remember?

663
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The gasoline cars.

664
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It outlived the gasoline cars.

665
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Rightfully so.

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That shouldn't have lived as long

667
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
as it did. Yeah but just the fact that

668
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
it has so much more staying power than

669
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
stuff where yeah like you said there's tech.

670
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
This is just a guy with a

671
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
body in a bag and he dumps it

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
into a trunk. Yes yeah.

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And there wasn't always that.

674
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That was a change.

675
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The Norman Bates show that

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
occurs and that there is a walk around Norman Bates.

677
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The urban legends.

678
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh yes that's true.

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Well so yeah I think

680
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
you know it's been on the tour since

681
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the tour started

682
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
like proper tram

683
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
tour starts in 64

684
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and which is

685
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
psycho 60 correct?

686
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
60 yeah. So they

687
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
left that up and it was like

688
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
it was a perfect you know probably one of

689
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the primary attractions. Yeah it was in a

690
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
different spot it's been moved around a

691
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
couple times. Yeah that's something I didn't

692
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
realize. I didn't know that until I

693
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
was doing some homework for this that it's

694
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
been packed up and moved around both the

695
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
motel and the house. Yeah yeah

696
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
which I wonder like it I'd wonder

697
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
that before but it's like it'd be weird because you have to also

698
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
recreate kind of the grounds because

699
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
the house has to be up on the stairs.

700
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The perspective of it from the.

701
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's hard to move the motel.

702
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The house I can conceive

703
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
of moving. Yeah because the house takes

704
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
up less space.

705
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And it's a little bit of an illusion.

706
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And it's hollow.

707
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I could feel you and I could just drag that

708
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
thing somewhere.

709
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But the motel no way.

710
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No but I guess you just break

711
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the hotel into pieces.

712
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah it's all the hotels

713
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
all empty on the inside as well.

714
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Moving houses

715
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
used to be more common

716
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
especially in Los Angeles people would

717
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
buy a different plot of land and move a

718
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
house. I think someone did it

719
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
a few years ago and

720
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
it was like

721
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
news. Really?

722
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
To move a house you had to put it

723
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
on like a giant truck and you

724
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
have to shut down roads.

725
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Is it the jerk? There's a whole gag

726
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
with the house on the truck

727
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
like that. Am I thinking of the right movie

728
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
where there's a whole set piece with the house?

729
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I know what you're talking about and I can't remember what it is.

730
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's not I don't know if you're

731
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
thinking of Freddie got fingered.

732
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He moves his father's house around

733
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
him to Pakistan.

734
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But I don't think it's

735
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
on a big arm.

736
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Kind of fun sequence.

737
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But this is the original

738
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Psycho House and Dates Motel.

739
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Well I don't know that.

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's the question is if they

741
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
moved the literal pieces

742
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
or not. I actually don't

743
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
know that.

744
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's like a Theseus's ship kind of thing.

745
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I wasn't sure if it

746
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
was one of the ones from the sequels

747
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
that survived because that was the one

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in the short lived one

749
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
in Universal Orlando

750
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
was technically the house from

751
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Psycho 4.

752
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Very much from Psycho 4. Built there

753
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in order

754
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
to have like an arbitrary

755
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
it's like

756
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
we're opening a movie studio. We got to film something there.

757
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Alright Psycho 4 is in motion.

758
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You're coming down here and they actually

759
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
were filming that right after the park

760
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
opened. So June 1990

761
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you could go right up to it

762
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and watch. They filmed most of it at night

763
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
so it wasn't really a problem.

764
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But I think there were times where they were actually filming

765
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
scenes and the regular

766
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
paying theme park people could walk pretty close

767
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
up to it. And the juxtaposition freaked

768
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
me out as a kid in 91

769
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
or 92 whenever my family went

770
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
because it's like the five hole

771
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
play area is here. The Psycho

772
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
4 is over there and there's a

773
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
giant hard rock cafe.

774
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I'm like what is going on? What is this?

775
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's a very chaotic corner.

776
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And also just the way that it like

777
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
it's almost like a sadder

778
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
it just descends into nothing

779
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
back there is what I remember.

780
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The theme park's over and it ends

781
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
at a scary house.

782
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Just like sad dusty

783
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
planes. There's like majesty

784
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
to the one in Hollywood.

785
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The way they presented it. It really

786
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
feels important in the way it's

787
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
whatever the two things are there.

788
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Do you think the ones here are

789
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
both of them are the original buildings.

790
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I know that the motel's

791
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
been refurbished.

792
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I think John

793
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Murdy who does the horror nights

794
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
he's the creative director. I think he

795
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
was involved in a big refurb

796
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
of the motel to kind of bring it back

797
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to what it would have looked like

798
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
because it's been used

799
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
it was used in the

800
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
98 remake.

801
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So a friend of mine

802
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
his name's Trevor Dow. He said it was fine if I

803
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
used his name. He is Norman Bates on

804
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
the tram tour. So there's a chance if

805
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you go on the tram tour or if you do the little

806
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
meet and greet it's Trevor.

807
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I asked him do you have any cool behind the

808
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
scenes stuff and he was

809
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
told me that the original

810
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
locations and stuff. He said that

811
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
in the remake

812
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
the motel used to be

813
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
like wooden planks.

814
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think there was a lot of wooden

815
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
stuff on the exterior but then it was changed

816
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
over to kind of cinder block.

817
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Which is still what it is now.

818
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So I think the motel's a weird

819
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
amalgamation of

820
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
original material but then also

821
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
stuff they put in for this remake.

822
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh interesting. Wow.

823
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because

824
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
they've definitely converted it back to the

825
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
old vibe for the most part because

826
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it's like

827
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
it's the old sign because that

828
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
you can so picture from the black and

829
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
white. And the 90s one was kind of more

830
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
90s one in general was all like kooky

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and a lot of Julianne Moore's wearing like dresses

832
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
with weird bubbles all over them.

833
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And then if I'm remembering correctly

834
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
what they did with the house

835
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
is even stranger. They don't even use

836
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
the psycho house

837
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
in the remake. They built

838
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
a like a front

839
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
in front of the house.

840
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So it's a different house but it's

841
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
concealing the actual

842
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
house. It's so bizarre.

843
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
They for sure use the

844
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
title in front of it but it's the old

845
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
house. It's like the

846
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
motel's there so you're like

847
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
there's the stairs and then so they just

848
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
built this weird house. It's a different house.

849
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's kind of I mean there's nothing

850
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
iconic about that house. Maybe if the movie

851
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
had been a hit it would have been but it's also kind of

852
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't know that could be where

853
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the puppies are being kept in

854
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
101 Dalmatians. There's nothing particularly

855
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
it doesn't it's not that like

856
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
there's no choice in the house like

857
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
the scary the creepy skinniness.

858
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's such a strange almost

859
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
meta thing I think because

860
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
when you watch the remake everyone's a bizarro

861
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
version of the original characters because

862
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
everything is so identical and

863
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I think they were just like why not

864
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
do that to the house too? Like the

865
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
house is almost like a weird

866
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
recast. You know what I mean?

867
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah. But framed with

868
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the same framing. It's so bizarre.

869
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I was glad I watched it. It was a very

870
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
interesting watch I thought.

871
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then that resulted in a weird time

872
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
where I might have taken the tour

873
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
in this time where then they moved

874
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
they kept the facade but they moved

875
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it over. So there was a time

876
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
right before the movie was going to come out where you

877
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
would go by there and there were two psycho houses

878
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
original in 98.

879
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Really strange. Bring it back.

880
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Bring it back. That I would

881
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
sign off on that for sure.

882
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So very strange. Interesting.

883
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
They kept some of the elements of it and they've

884
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
refurbished it and that's been the spot

885
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
since

886
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
mid 80s I think.

887
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I think the current spot is like

888
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
80s to present. It moved around

889
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
a bunch before that.

890
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know what? It doesn't need to be

891
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the same. I don't care

892
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
that it moved up the hill.

893
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They recreated the vibe perfectly.

894
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's 100 feet away.

895
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's still magical to be

896
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
again if you do the tram tour to get

897
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that close to it.

898
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I don't know. Just so aware that

899
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
this is the stuff they used.

900
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's so neat. Yeah.

901
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I don't know if they're doing this this year with the

902
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Terra Tram. You get to walk right

903
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
up front by the motel too.

904
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There's skis there.

905
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It goes through the parking lot and they have

906
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
people popping out of the motel rooms

907
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and stuff. That's cool.

908
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The first time I got to do that I was like whoa wow

909
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that's cool. I almost wished it was more psycho

910
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
themed. Yeah that would

911
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
be cool. But I don't know if it was just a bunch of

912
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Normans. Who would you have popping out

913
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
of each one? In every room.

914
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Twelve Normans.

915
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Wait now your friend

916
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
because you were doing a list.

917
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Anything else he told you about

918
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
what that experience is

919
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
like? Day to day

920
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
what a Norman shift is like.

921
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I didn't get any gruesome

922
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
details. I just imagine it's a lot

923
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
of sitting and waiting.

924
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But I do think that

925
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
they wait in

926
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it's the original. It's cabin one

927
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
which is apparently the only

928
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
usable room in the motel. It's got all the

929
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
furniture and it's made up to look like

930
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
the room.

931
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't know if they used

932
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
the interiors

933
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
of the

934
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
motel for the movie but it is like

935
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
made up. I don't think they did. I was

936
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
curious about that. I think that might have been on a stage.

937
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm like I brought stuff with me.

938
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Wow. I did homework.

939
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You printed things. I did print

940
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
things. Yeah yeah yeah. He hasn't

941
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
had to like just when you're playing Norman Bates

942
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you don't have to do like a Leto style

943
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
yourself acting thing.

944
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He makes a face and he acts scary.

945
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What's funny is like

946
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
on that note

947
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
my friend who does it and when I was doing

948
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
some kind of homework for this I found

949
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
someone else on Reddit saying that they

950
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
knew someone who played Norman as well and that

951
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it's something where he knew a lot about

952
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
the history of the building and I get

953
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the sense that all the guys who play

954
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Norman are like

955
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
really love and care about

956
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
this building and the history

957
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and are like very attached to it and are just

958
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
you know like I don't know what I was expecting

959
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
to get from my friend but this is all

960
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
just very like oh here's some like genuinely

961
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
cool stuff about not

962
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
like oh yeah here's what my day

963
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I sit around and it's boring you know it was

964
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
like no this is I get to be in this

965
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
really cool piece I don't know and it's

966
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
it is in a weird way it's very

967
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
they're just very nice young

968
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
boys who are very respectful

969
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
of the history

970
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
that they're surrounded by and it just all

971
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
feels very appropriate it feels

972
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
that just feels to me like when you go

973
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
into the whatever the pavilion the room

974
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to see the American Adventure at the American

975
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and Epcot Center yeah all the people

976
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
in there are like museum

977
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
level history nerds

978
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
American nerds and like

979
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
you really feel that from almost

980
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
everybody at least not necessarily

981
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the people that work at the barbecue kiosk outside

982
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but the people inside that

983
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
are showing you around like I bet there's

984
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Sam the Eagle barbecue

985
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
enthusiast but there

986
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
may be not as diehard as the people

987
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
that will explain like these are George W.

988
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Bush's boots and they know everything about the

989
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
boots

990
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I like hearing that there are like

991
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Norman enthusiasts yeah they're almost

992
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
like docents it feels like

993
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
they you know just because they end up

994
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
spending so much time in there

995
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
what I remember when they start they started the program

996
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
when I was still working there I think I started

997
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
2006 and I feel like oh seven

998
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
or oh eight they started having and I

999
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
sometimes you would like if you were because I started

1000
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
working very seasonally and I think

1001
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I may have encountered Norman

1002
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
for the first time and it was genuinely a surprise

1003
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think maybe nobody told me

1004
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
that they were doing that yeah and I just had

1005
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to react which is not

1006
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I did not think it was an actual

1007
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm so maniac

1008
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
just out there randomly but I

1009
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
remember that it was like I recognized

1010
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
all the people who were doing it and they were all people who were tour

1011
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
guides and I think like VIP tour guides

1012
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and the people who like really cared

1013
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
about it so like yeah I think something about it

1014
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
attracts like film historians

1015
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
like to do that part

1016
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and there's one I know I didn't

1017
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
because I did that job so long ago and I don't

1018
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
remember his name but I should

1019
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
say hi at some point but like I will

1020
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I end up at the same coffee shop a lot

1021
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
with one of the Normans

1022
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and I remember him being

1023
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
a nice guy from working there but I more remember

1024
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
that he was Norman so there's still something for

1025
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
me where I'm like oh Norman

1026
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I better hole up in a corner and what's the

1027
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
furthest away I can get here

1028
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
there's this it's an Irving

1029
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
so he already got a cold foam

1030
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
cold brew and then he just came over

1031
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and said we all go a little mid

1032
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
sometimes right Scott

1033
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
so it sounds like I just looked at

1034
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the stuff I brought I do think they might have

1035
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
shot the motel interiors in there

1036
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
really really oh my god and

1037
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
my friend said this is I didn't see this anywhere

1038
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
online so this might be like

1039
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
cast member knowledge or just a fun little

1040
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
secret that I couldn't find pictures

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
of or anything but apparently

1042
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Marley Renfro who

1043
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
was the body double for the shower

1044
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
scene because she was willing to do

1045
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
like on screen nudity

1046
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
she

1047
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
apparently recently visited she's

1048
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the only living cast member

1049
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
still yeah she's like in her 90s

1050
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I think but she came to visit

1051
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
she apparently booked it

1052
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
because she had modeled for Playboy

1053
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and so it was like oh yeah I'm comfortable

1054
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
doing it and

1055
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
she I don't know how recently

1056
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
she was there but she apparently signed

1057
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
the shower like her signatures in

1058
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the motel and there is a shower

1059
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
in there wow that's

1060
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
what makes me think they might have filmed it

1061
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
right if there's that much stuff yeah

1062
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
wow wow crazy

1063
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that's very that's fascinating yeah

1064
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I didn't see that anywhere online this might

1065
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
just be kind of a cool thing that recently

1066
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
happened yeah

1067
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I also think it's cool

1068
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to see this because like

1069
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
there's all the other horror stuff

1070
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
like Michael Myers is around

1071
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
like Psycho hasn't been like

1072
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
there hasn't been a sequel for many

1073
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
years it's like a lot at one

1074
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
point at one point there were a ton I'm just saying

1075
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
now it almost feels a little more special going

1076
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
to see it because oh that's that old movie

1077
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and now it's like I get to live

1078
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it I get to live it here I don't see it everywhere

1079
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
it's not on billboards it's not like

1080
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
there's some specialness about it

1081
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
because of that in my mind

1082
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
not that I don't think they should do ten sequels to

1083
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the Gus Van Sant movie I'm just saying

1084
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to me I feel

1085
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I want to see a remake of that

1086
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
with some like additional

1087
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
scenes that we can keep doing this weird

1088
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
like you know

1089
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
copy of a copy of a copy

1090
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
how far can we degrade

1091
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
what this movie ends up being

1092
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
oh yeah and by the if you did it for

1093
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
the seventh time would it still resemble

1094
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
the old one or would enough

1095
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
variances occur that it's

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
kind of its own movie now yeah like the half

1097
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
life of it yes yes exactly

1098
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
yeah it's degrading

1099
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
somewhat yeah is there

1100
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
an episode of the Freddie

1101
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Highmore Bates Motel TV

1102
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
show that's just a shot

1103
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
shot remake of the Gus Van Sant

1104
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that would be good yeah psycho

1105
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
should be there was that too

1106
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
really there is per your

1107
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
statement there's been a lot of psycho there's

1108
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
been a lot okay fine I forgot about the TV

1109
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
show but not lately but not lately

1110
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
is what I'm saying I don't feel like a miracle

1111
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
there's other stuff that like you see the minions

1112
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you go well the minions are everywhere all the time

1113
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I feel like so I just it feels good

1114
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
to me I didn't watch the show I'm sorry

1115
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I didn't watch the show

1116
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
some people like the show I remember that now

1117
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
yeah the

1118
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think you kind of alluded to

1119
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't this may have inspired

1120
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the notion of putting characters

1121
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
up there because

1122
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
there was this story

1123
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't know if it was urban legend or I think it did actually

1124
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
happen but I believe

1125
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that around

1126
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
1999 that a

1127
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
tram tour

1128
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
was attacked by

1129
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
somebody dressed as mother

1130
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and it was

1131
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
genuinely upsetting because

1132
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it's what I was fearing when I went

1133
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
by like I'm gonna assume that's an employee that is

1134
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Norman Bates but in this case

1135
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
truly nobody knew what it

1136
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
was and the guide came back

1137
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and was freaked and

1138
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
when they poked around and figured out

1139
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
what happened it was Jim Carrey

1140
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
filming

1141
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
man on the moon

1142
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
so in his the anarchic

1143
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Kaufman spirit

1144
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
which we know

1145
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
much about and we're nerved by

1146
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
much about in that documentary

1147
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
but fun

1148
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I mean that is kind of like living the dream

1149
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I feel like there's probably I think there

1150
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
are some people who have filmed entire

1151
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
projects and been on the lot

1152
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
a lot who do not

1153
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
care and don't want to engage

1154
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
with but I love hearing

1155
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
because I loved it as a kid and I did it

1156
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
as a job the idea

1157
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that an actor would be like oh my god

1158
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we're on the tram I'm a theme park

1159
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
attraction let's go make some

1160
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
madness happen

1161
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so that's fun

1162
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
we got Jason Anthony Gio and I got to do

1163
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
this because Gio was working on the lot and he took

1164
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
us behind Amity on the lake

1165
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
yeah we got a golf cart

1166
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and we got to like I mean no one told us we could do this

1167
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
but we just like reacted as if jaws had

1168
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
come out and we were surprised

1169
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
well you and Gio did I just

1170
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
was smiling and waving at the door

1171
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I missed the direction I was going to be nice

1172
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and not bring up the fact that Gio told us exactly what to do

1173
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and you just did not do it

1174
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Gio and I went oh my god and you were just like

1175
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Jason act scared

1176
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
he said scared I think I had

1177
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
turned around and was distracted because

1178
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
behind one of the building

1179
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
facades there was a bunch of

1180
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
broken office chairs and I was like guys

1181
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
look it's like an office chair graveyard

1182
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
back here for some reason

1183
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
for some reason I was like how did these

1184
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
office chairs get here there's no office

1185
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
close by and then

1186
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
if there's options A and B

1187
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
to be excited about Jason will always

1188
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
find option G

1189
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
yeah I just thought

1190
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
it was so strange and then we got in

1191
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the golf cart and we drove up and

1192
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
parked behind the Bates motel

1193
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
yeah yeah and we

1194
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
there was a Norman

1195
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
walking around and there was

1196
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
a VIP trolley

1197
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
then people walking around it's like

1198
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
oh we shouldn't

1199
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
be here like we are just

1200
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
looky loose

1201
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
no one cares no one cares

1202
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that is the rule if you sneak onto the universal lot

1203
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
no one cares just act like

1204
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
you belong there as long as no one catches you sneaking on

1205
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
no one cares now

1206
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
if you sneak back to the

1207
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
lot with the utility

1208
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
vehicles and the free gas

1209
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
pumps people will probably

1210
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
oh my god

1211
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
this is again the most Jason-y thing

1212
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
your scheming of how to get free gas

1213
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
because you have a meeting

1214
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
as long as it's gas meant for a

1215
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
four car tram but as long

1216
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
as they don't have auto shut

1217
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
on like they sent me as an intern to

1218
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
go fill up the gas of the

1219
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
the golf cart

1220
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
that's why you were terrified

1221
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
my husband worked on the lot

1222
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
when we both first moved out

1223
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
he was a production assistant so we also would

1224
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
take the golf cart and go all over it

1225
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
what was he on what did he do

1226
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
he just worked for like the studios

1227
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
post department so yeah lots of

1228
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
running hard drives and

1229
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
free gas

1230
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
yeah

1231
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
they built out

1232
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that side it's by the bar

1233
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
gate where they built all these

1234
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
additional sound stages and the

1235
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
restore facade used to be there

1236
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
we gotta get him free gas

1237
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
we gotta get

1238
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
somebody to get us a drive on

1239
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
maybe it was diesel maybe it was lead I don't know

1240
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I just like to imagine the one that you

1241
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
like you went on to the bar

1242
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
side like got under

1243
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the fence like glugged as much as you can

1244
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and spit it out as soon as you got

1245
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
out of the

1246
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
well I also god knows what I inhale

1247
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
a gallon of liquid

1248
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
when I was a PA I

1249
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
had to go pick up like hard drives

1250
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
or paperwork or something once

1251
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
at these temporary offices

1252
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
a day after

1253
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
the King Kong fire and there's

1254
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
just people in hazmat suits

1255
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and the people in the temporary offices

1256
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
just had fans going in every

1257
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
direction that was your time to strike

1258
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and they were all distracted by the fire

1259
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
it should have stocked up on gas

1260
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
they're

1261
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't know why we

1262
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
always get excited my husband and I love the fact that

1263
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
it has its own fire department

1264
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
that is a fun thing

1265
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
that's one of the first things you see too you're right before

1266
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
stage 12 you're on your way down

1267
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't know why it's so exciting to me just this tiny little

1268
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
it's like a Richard

1269
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
scary kind of

1270
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
fire department you know

1271
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
that's what proves it's a real city you're like

1272
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
universal city that's cute but fake

1273
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
no no no there's a fire department

1274
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Disneyland has a fire department

1275
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
so there is like something to like

1276
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
even if it was real or not I feel like it wouldn't matter

1277
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
there's the idea that there's a special one

1278
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
yeah have you all seen the Trey

1279
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Parker Matt Stone video that

1280
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
they made oh the secret

1281
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
yes yes yes

1282
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
your studio and you yes yes yes

1283
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
the black and white right

1284
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it's an old film strip

1285
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that with lots of

1286
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
big cameos in yeah there's like Demi Moore

1287
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Steven Spielberg's driving

1288
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
the tram

1289
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Bruce the shark pops out

1290
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and he goes ah it's scary

1291
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
that he kind of just you know

1292
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that's right a nonplussed Spielberg

1293
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
doing that's a great idea

1294
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
like eating an apple the whole time

1295
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
it's oh it's so good

1296
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
he asks questions and then kind of like between bites

1297
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
what about yeah

1298
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
it's so I love that thing so much

1299
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
when it has the it's a great piece of

1300
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean like great for the studio

1301
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
stuff but also like that it

1302
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
has the South Park energy

1303
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
in the Trey Parker voice so like

1304
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
say that and which is like I just

1305
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
went to Casa Bonita and

1306
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I listened to that episode and I

1307
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I want to go there

1308
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
so bad you totally sold me

1309
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
it's so yeah I feel like I may have led

1310
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
to a wave of people which I'm so

1311
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
glad about and his voice is part

1312
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
of the magic of it I it's so cool there's a

1313
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
permanent spot that has that but

1314
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and since we

1315
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
did that episode I very recently

1316
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
in tandem with the documentary they have

1317
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
made it easier to go

1318
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
reservations are now open to the book I

1319
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
still can't imagine it's that easy

1320
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
with the six hundred thousand people

1321
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
who are trying to do it but there is

1322
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
a way I signed up for

1323
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the Founders Club email

1324
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and Evan Susser also

1325
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
signed up yesterday he said he

1326
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
did he said he listened to the episode

1327
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and he did what you said turn the episode

1328
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
off and sign up great

1329
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
so he actually did it in the order you said

1330
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
because I really didn't want to I

1331
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it deserves to not be spoiled

1332
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
it really like because there are surprises

1333
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
especially Blackbird's Cave

1334
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
just don't do not if you haven't heard it

1335
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
already don't listen to what I said about Blackbird's Cave

1336
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
it's so fun you might get

1337
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
rewarded for your promotion with

1338
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
a second reservation

1339
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
one of the rarest

1340
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
theme park things in the country because mine

1341
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
was a trade with somebody who did

1342
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
get to go himself because I think he

1343
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
he was smart and set up a separate

1344
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
one a month later too

1345
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
he nailed it so I do

1346
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
still have my

1347
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
yeah I have a backup but I don't know when

1348
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'll get to do it but well you got to

1349
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
get back to LH Gardens and do all this

1350
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
stuff that was closed

1351
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
oh what a time never again never again

1352
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I just think with stuff like

1353
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the universal video that those

1354
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
guys made I don't know just finding other people

1355
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
where you're like oh you like this stuff the same

1356
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
way I do is so exciting

1357
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
you know because I

1358
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
think I don't know I mean I guess now there's more

1359
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
of the idea of like theme park adults or

1360
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Disney adults it's more of like a pop

1361
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
cultural kind of thing but just

1362
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know because there's something that is not

1363
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I don't know like theme parks are never the thing

1364
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
that you think people are going to find

1365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
a respectable interest to have

1366
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
it's just not there's nothing

1367
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
cool about it

1368
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and you have to and it's probably

1369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
when I was engaging with

1370
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
the least was kind of like

1371
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
teen years 20s

1372
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
because like you need the

1373
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
currency of cool and cool music

1374
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and stuff but if you get past that

1375
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I feel like for me it completely lines

1376
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
up with like meeting my

1377
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
wife oh I don't have to date anymore all right

1378
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
well fuck cool I do not

1379
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
need to care about that

1380
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
whatsoever but

1381
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I think what is great about it is that like

1382
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
everybody who shares the interest are like such

1383
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
like

1384
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
fun bubbly people for the most

1385
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
part like everybody's like

1386
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
everybody does like it in the same way which is pretty

1387
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
like lit up I think it's a

1388
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
fandom that's

1389
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
there's like miserable fandoms there's fandoms

1390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
where everybody just kind of like reads off a list and you've seen

1391
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
this okay good

1392
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
but I find yeah I think the fandom

1393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
tends to be pretty like

1394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I went on this thing it was so cool wow

1395
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I think the fandom is maturing and when I say maturing

1396
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I mean there is more bad

1397
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
coming it's growing it's been growing

1398
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
a lot there's a lot more content creators

1399
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
we're certainly part of that

1400
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
but then you know I there's so many different

1401
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
the Rivers of America was going away in Florida

1402
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
a lot of people started popping up

1403
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
on my feet and I went oh this feels like you know what

1404
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I should be proud of the fandom for growing up

1405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
so I see all some bad stuff now

1406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
more often yeah that's true

1407
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
the sign of success Star Wars has been

1408
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
a fandom for decades now

1409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and there's so many different pockets

1410
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
there's the resistance there's the first order

1411
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
there's different types whatever but this I feel

1412
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
like oh my god it's kind of it's coming into its

1413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
own there's so many different

1414
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
yeah because ten years ago I don't even

1415
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
know I was I rediscovered all this stuff

1416
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I guess in our late

1417
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Jason and I when we got started going to Disneyland a lot again

1418
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and I was like oh yeah this is cool and it felt

1419
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
so small at that time

1420
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but now it feels like it's a big industry almost

1421
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
big enough for some to be toxic

1422
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
but that

1423
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
shows that's what I'm saying that's

1424
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
success and that's showing that overall there's

1425
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
more awareness about it and like Horror Nights

1426
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
has its own very dedicated

1427
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
fandom as well especially Orlando's

1428
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
because Orlando's leans a lot

1429
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
harder into its own kind of

1430
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
lore which I'm not super

1431
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
familiar with because I don't

1432
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
really I've only been to

1433
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Universal Orlando once and it was to do

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Horror Nights specifically

1435
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
but they have like

1436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
their park icons

1437
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
like every year there's a Horror Nights

1438
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
icon and often they're returning

1439
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
characters and they're all kind of

1440
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
interconnected and related

1441
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and there's this whole like you scratch the surface

1442
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and there's so much

1443
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
lore we did a podcast episode

1444
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
on it once and got so much

1445
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
stuff wrong and people were

1446
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
sad and I

1447
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
realized then like oh wow this is

1448
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
really really important to some

1449
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
people I get it you know

1450
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
but there's not a lot of

1451
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
the company

1452
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
is starting to

1453
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
not only build

1454
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
out the lore but keep a record of it

1455
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
because there's it's mostly

1456
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
fan created

1457
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
like when we did the

1458
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
episode about when Horror

1459
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Nights was at Islands of Adventure

1460
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and it's like oh yeah the Marvel

1461
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Island was taken over by Carnage and the

1462
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
villains like

1463
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
there was so little

1464
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
video and photos and stuff

1465
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you're saying the fans sort of are like

1466
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
they're the archive yeah yeah they were

1467
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
the ones that kind of kept it going when it wasn't

1468
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
so like on the minds of everybody

1469
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
yeah and they're I

1470
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
feel like Horror Nights in Orlando

1471
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
this year there's a lot more original

1472
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
their original houses are very popular

1473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
down there yeah Orlando does

1474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
a lot more original stuff versus

1475
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and like oh this house was a

1476
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
scare zone it was very well received

1477
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
so it got upgraded or this

1478
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
is a this house is

1479
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
a sequel to the house from three

1480
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
years ago like it's

1481
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
really interesting I've seen people say

1482
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
we have to do an episode on those and I feel

1483
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
intimidated honestly it's intimidating

1484
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
it feels like not this year not this year I'm not ready

1485
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
not this year there's so many icons

1486
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
yes and to what you were talking

1487
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
about it is hard to get a sense

1488
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
of the kind of correct

1489
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
like the canon and timeline

1490
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
of stuff because so much of it's just fan

1491
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
documented and you'll find stuff that like

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
contradicts itself and it's like I don't know

1493
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
you know I feel like I haven't been

1494
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
part of it this whole time so as an outsider

1495
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
trying to get a perspective on like what this

1496
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
kind of running story is it's so hard

1497
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
yeah if you haven't been there

1498
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
for any of it so you can't catalog like

1499
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
oh yeah I remember that was the vibe of 07

1500
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
or like they have the opening ceremony where

1501
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
it's scripted and there's stuff that happens

1502
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and you know yeah trying to find video

1503
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
of that that's this is like a ten

1504
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
year project for us we'll be ready

1505
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
in ten years yeah

1506
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
yeah but we'll be yeah ten years it'll take

1507
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
to find everything you can always do an episode

1508
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
on the weird like one off

1509
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
houses like we spent a lot of time

1510
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
on that universal the Orlando

1511
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Horror Nights episode talking about the Undertaker

1512
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
themed house that we're kind of

1513
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
obsessed with yes but

1514
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
it's great because the wrestler

1515
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the Undertaker yes it was a WW

1516
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Undertaker WWF

1517
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
well an Undertaker could be anything

1518
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I just want to make sure

1519
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
about the profession in general

1520
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
what do you mean

1521
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm also telling the list

1522
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
you know a working man

1523
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
his name is Mark

1524
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Calloway

1525
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I didn't know that

1526
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
but what's great is I think

1527
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think at that point in time

1528
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Undertaker was in his American

1529
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
badass era so all the

1530
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
stuff he's got the like American

1531
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
flag bandana on and

1532
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
there's a video of him going through the house

1533
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
where he's still it's all you know he's

1534
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
keeping kayfabe and is like yeah

1535
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I remember when that happened and

1536
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
you know it's it's it's

1537
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
just goes through it like it is a

1538
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
diorama of things that actually happened

1539
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
in his real life yes

1540
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
because it's all these different eras yes

1541
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and he's like commenting on each scare actor

1542
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and it's like the yeah

1543
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
my brother in hell

1544
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
that's forever ago yeah

1545
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
he's lazily committing to the bit in that

1546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
because yes he he had an

1547
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
era and I'm this is I don't

1548
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
less well known he had an era where he just wore

1549
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
like jeans and rode a motorcycle

1550
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and had a bandana and he wasn't

1551
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
undead anymore and it was his

1552
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
American badass era and

1553
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
he came out to either Olympus gets rolling

1554
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
or Kid Rocks American badass

1555
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
and it was

1556
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
not the best time

1557
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
to be an undertaker fan

1558
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
people were like yeah but we like it

1559
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
when he comes out of like a coffin and stuff

1560
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
we like the farm like the nonsense we like it when it

1561
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
takes him 10 minutes to walk to the

1562
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
ring yeah and there are druids when

1563
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
he comes to the entrance and the song

1564
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and the music whatever so yes that that

1565
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
is a funny I don't know what you mean when I was

1566
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
talking about the 2000s and needing to be

1567
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
feeling needing to be cool

1568
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
more that's what I meant I meant I was listening

1569
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
to American badass all the time yeah yeah yeah yeah

1570
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
the coolest song

1571
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
very cool

1572
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
still cool honestly

1573
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
or Ball with the Ball you know the

1574
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
film director Frederick Durst his

1575
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
previous project

1576
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Ball with the Ball that was Kid Rock

1577
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm sorry to tell you my man oh that was fuck

1578
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
new metal and

1579
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
oh man

1580
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Kid Rock was new metal

1581
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
yeah Kid Rock's so weird

1582
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I guess you could count on

1583
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
new metal I don't know

1584
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I just get that arrow

1585
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
rap rock confused

1586
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
yeah you're right there's no metal in it

1587
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
per se yeah yeah

1588
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I never got into it cause that's what my

1589
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
pulleys listened to

1590
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
back in the late 90s that's our punch

1591
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and music and

1592
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
America that's the sound of them punching you

1593
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
American badass

1594
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
well the pulleys had

1595
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
rock and stone cold t-shirts

1596
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
at that point that's probably why I

1597
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
never engaged with wrestling then yeah

1598
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I didn't realize it was a nerdy thing

1599
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
yeah again

1600
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
the fandom matures you know

1601
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
the fandom has higher expectations

1602
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
there was nerdy characters to like

1603
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
the ones I like mankind was my guy

1604
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I was gonna say Mick Foley

1605
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
is like for the nerds for sure

1606
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
he's one of the nicest people

1607
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
ever by the way he does the horror convention

1608
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
circuit so at this point we've done

1609
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
a few shows with him and he's

1610
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
so sweet like he's just

1611
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
very jolly and a legit theme park

1612
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
nerd yes and always been

1613
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
there's like him and the hearty boys in Islands of Adventure

1614
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
photos from 1999

1615
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
that's really

1616
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
good wow wow

1617
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
can I bring up an old Orlando thing but I mean

1618
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I think I said most of what I was gonna

1619
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
say about Psycho 4 but then

1620
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that when that house was still

1621
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
up there and

1622
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
the motel I don't think that you could

1623
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
walk through it for mazes

1624
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
in the way

1625
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
we do in Hollywood but you could

1626
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
apparently I just watched a video

1627
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
that had a brief clip of a show

1628
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
where it's the Bates Motel

1629
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and in front of it

1630
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
hopping around our

1631
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Beetlejuice and the Blues brothers

1632
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
together so I would

1633
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
like to know the full context

1634
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
the dense narrative

1635
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
like in the front yard

1636
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
they're just in the

1637
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
middle of the hotel courtyard

1638
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
in front of room 6

1639
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and hopping I know that's all I know

1640
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is the two second clip but boy

1641
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
it spoke to me

1642
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
the other fact about

1643
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Psycho 4 per things

1644
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
we've talked about before directed by

1645
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Mick Garris

1646
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm sure you know Mick

1647
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
what jumped out at me

1648
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
is that Mick Garris is the

1649
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
writer and director of Fuzz Bucket

1650
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
one of the worst things

1651
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
we've ever watched for the show

1652
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
this was when Disney Plus came out

1653
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and there was a question of like

1654
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
how deep do they go

1655
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
what's the weirdest thing on Disney Plus

1656
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
the weirdest thing may have been Fuzz Bucket

1657
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
this awful little creature

1658
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
it was so unpleasant

1659
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
this is the first time I've heard of Fuzz Bucket

1660
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
to be honest

1661
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I do want to see what it looks like

1662
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
a picture

1663
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
we can get a reaction on that and then the kind of thing

1664
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
he says

1665
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
it might be a ring situation

1666
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
where like don't go out

1667
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
be careful

1668
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm trying to find the biggest photo

1669
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
what's Mick Garris

1670
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
he wrote Hocus Pocus

1671
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
he did the

1672
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Shining miniseries

1673
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
with Steven Weber

1674
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and I'm trying to think what else

1675
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
he's just one of like horror's elder

1676
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
statesmen like he's always at horror

1677
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
events he's very kind soft spoken

1678
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and has very long silver hair

1679
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
like he just he's got kind of a Gandalf

1680
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
type wizardy presence

1681
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
where he's very wise

1682
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
we know him at this point

1683
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm always still kind of intimidated

1684
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
by him even though he's very gentle

1685
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
you gotta ask him about

1686
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Fuzz Bucket

1687
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I genuinely will next time

1688
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
you really picked the worst one

1689
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
you brought that up in such close up on your laptop

1690
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
he's so happy

1691
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
he's like so happy

1692
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and so zoomed in in that picture

1693
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and then it's

1694
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
like the copy of the copy psycho premise

1695
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I always forget what the thing

1696
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
now in my head the weird thing that he says

1697
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
is like hey let's get wet

1698
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
party boy

1699
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
it's not like it's wet but we thought

1700
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
it is party boy

1701
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I've just searched for my old notes about

1702
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Fuzz Bucket to see if I can figure it out

1703
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
it's not this but I also feel like it's hang loose

1704
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
party boy or something like that

1705
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
but I don't think it's hang loose either

1706
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I guess it's just how we doing party boy

1707
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
we would have been right about party boy

1708
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
because I think in the

1709
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
episode on this I think we were debating

1710
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
like it sounds like party boy

1711
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
but that's kind of a weird thing for this creature

1712
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
to say cause it's not like in like

1713
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
ET or something hears something they're repeating

1714
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
it's just like this guy's calling this kid party boy

1715
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
which isn't even a phrase

1716
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
like a familiar phrase

1717
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I really think his vocabulary as a writer

1718
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
is kind of bizarre cause in Hocus Pocus

1719
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
there's like Yabos

1720
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
where he's there

1721
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I don't know

1722
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I'm learning some things

1723
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yabos is some weird

1724
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that's something Thora Birch says

1725
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
it's almost like in Back to the Future 2

1726
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
when there's all these future

1727
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
slang terms that aren't real

1728
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and that's how a Yabos is like jerk or something

1729
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
to a kid

1730
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I think it's slang for

1731
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I thought it was slang for boobs

1732
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
oh

1733
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I thought she was calling them

1734
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
jerks like a bunch of Yabos

1735
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
oh did you see her Yabos

1736
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
oh right weird

1737
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
oh there he is again

1738
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
let's get one more photo of Fuzzbucket

1739
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
he's giving a little like over the shoulder

1740
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
oh yeah he has a

1741
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
high

1742
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
he's mischievous in this

1743
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
he apparently also says according to my notes

1744
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
you love Fuzzbucket give smooch

1745
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I wasn't expecting that picture to

1746
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
scroll down I didn't know there was like

1747
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
a full body

1748
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
he's got the tail going

1749
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
we're kicking off a season of Frights Right

1750
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
this is some of the scariest images

1751
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
we'll see all month long

1752
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
he's a contemporary of like Mack and Me

1753
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
yeah they'd be friends

1754
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
little guys era

1755
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
like pre

1756
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
pre or around the time of Harry

1757
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and the Hendersons

1758
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
but before

1759
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Warriors of Virtue

1760
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that's that movie right

1761
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
which movie is that

1762
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
this is weird 1996 bomb

1763
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
or 97

1764
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Warriors of Virtue were a bunch of

1765
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
like weird like wolf

1766
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
or bunny they were like the Ninja

1767
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Turtles but what if they were like rabbits

1768
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
or something nobody's ever

1769
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
seen like it sounds like

1770
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
like a Christian

1771
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
cartoon show or something

1772
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
you're not allowed to watch the satanic

1773
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
cartoons but you can watch Warriors of Virtue

1774
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
it may have been and I just wasn't

1775
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
clued into that but like

1776
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
are they kangaroos

1777
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
we're in the Zubli Zoo zone

1778
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
we're in a frightening zone here

1779
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
did we, forgive me guys

1780
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
did we talk about Michael Eisner

1781
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and Fuzzbucket on that episode

1782
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
we have to right

1783
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I am 110% positive

1784
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
though I don't remember what he

1785
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
well he did an intro for it

1786
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and Fuzzbucket is in the video with him

1787
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
oh my goodness

1788
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and Mickey's there too

1789
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
and Mickey, Fuzzbucket and Michael Eisner

1790
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
were all together

1791
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
next time I see Mick

1792
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm gonna ask about this

1793
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I didn't know him that well so he's gonna be like

1794
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
why were you even thinking of him

1795
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
okay

1796
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
it's not incorrect to say

1797
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
well there's been a new, cause at Disney Plus

1798
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
there's a new cult for Fuzzbucket

1799
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
even if that cult is only 10 people

1800
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and they were scared of the movie

1801
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
we can get back to the like little guys

1802
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
era

1803
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
whether it's like one little guy

1804
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
or like a bunch of little guys, like critters

1805
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
you know, or ghoulies

1806
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
there was a thread recently online

1807
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I should find it

1808
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
of all the different countries

1809
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
ET rip-offs

1810
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and it was unbelievable

1811
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
because they all had different takes on the material

1812
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and they all had different budget levels

1813
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
so some of them were just

1814
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
the scariest, cheapest looking things

1815
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and then some of them were the worst, scariest things

1816
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
like oh they got some money to do this

1817
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
but there were multiple countries that did

1818
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
rip-off ETs

1819
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I should find it, I sent this to GEO the other day

1820
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'll find it, I'll find it

1821
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
do you have something that you've stumbled across

1822
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
in the years of doing your podcast

1823
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that's like

1824
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
nope, no fondness for this

1825
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
scared of this, don't like this creature

1826
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
not really

1827
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
no Fuzzbuck, nobody

1828
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
no, I genuinely

1829
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I just, no, I can't think of

1830
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
anything that I'm like super repulsed by

1831
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I'm sure if anyone is

1832
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
listening that also listens to our show

1833
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
you're probably yelling an example at me

1834
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
okay, well wait

1835
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
where do you stand on Art the Clown?

1836
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
where do you stand on the Terrifier?

1837
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
David Howard Thornton is a very nice man

1838
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
it's a weird thing because

1839
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
horror is tiny

1840
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and we all kind of know each other

1841
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
because we end up doing the convention circus together

1842
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
so the Terrifier team is like

1843
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
the nicest, most normal people

1844
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
and he's a professionally trained mime

1845
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
he's like just a very

1846
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
he's super sweet

1847
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and I have an Art the Clown

1848
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
story

1849
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
the first time my parents

1850
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
ever came to a horror convention

1851
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
to help us table and kind of just

1852
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
see what the horror scene

1853
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
is like

1854
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
we were tabling next to David

1855
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
who plays art and the rest of the

1856
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Terrifier crew from like Terrifier 1

1857
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
and they were doing

1858
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
an in costume

1859
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
photo op where people could

1860
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
take pictures with him all dressed up

1861
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and that

1862
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
same morning my parents brought in

1863
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
like doughnuts and coffee

1864
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
and they were, you know, they

1865
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
see him in costume and they're like hey we knew you were

1866
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
doing your big photo shoot so we brought you

1867
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
breakfast and he's being

1868
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I'm just watching him being so sweet to

1869
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
my parents, they've never seen

1870
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
this movie and I'm telling them

1871
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I was like do not under any

1872
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm like I'm not letting you watch it

1873
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
that nice girl you were talking

1874
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
to, Catherine, yeah she gets sawed in half

1875
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
like the long way upside down

1876
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and you don't want to see it

1877
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
we want to watch your friends movie

1878
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
that's the thing is like for my parents

1879
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
their image of art is just this

1880
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
nice, he's like an actual nice

1881
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
clown

1882
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
they're sweet

1883
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
the Terrifier movies are interesting

1884
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
the first one I don't like

1885
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
because I think

1886
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
it's just kind of mean, like it's a mean

1887
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I don't know if any of you have seen it

1888
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
it's a lot, yeah, yeah

1889
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
it's just kind of a mean movie

1890
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
and it is

1891
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the director Damian is he's an

1892
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
effects guy so it is

1893
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
it is like an effects showcase

1894
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
so if that's what you're looking for

1895
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
you'll like it kind of thing

1896
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
it's very intense gore, the second one

1897
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I think is a lot of fun

1898
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
it's extremely graphic

1899
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
it is still kind of an

1900
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
effects showcase

1901
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
but there is more of a story in this

1902
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
one and there's some interesting like

1903
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
almost supernatural stuff going on

1904
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and I just

1905
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
art's fun you know

1906
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
he's just having so much fun doing the most

1907
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
fucked up shit you've ever

1908
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
seen that I can't help but like

1909
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
it I'm also so desensitized

1910
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
at this point this is

1911
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
we go back and forth I feel like every

1912
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Halloween season where like

1913
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
we were scared little boys

1914
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and scared young men and then scared

1915
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
adults so we like

1916
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
micro dose horror and stuff

1917
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
but the convention

1918
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the small

1919
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
close-knit community in the convention

1920
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
world coming like

1921
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
as fans of comic books and

1922
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
professional wrestling is so familiar

1923
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
to me

1924
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
it's so recognizable where it's

1925
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
like I have a lot of respect for horror

1926
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I see the craft I see the

1927
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
community but I am

1928
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
very easily startled

1929
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
so it's like having okay I did

1930
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Baba Duke working up

1931
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
to a pinhead

1932
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and it follows like piecing

1933
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
myself starting with

1934
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I saw the TV glow gonna

1935
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
do that next cause that just

1936
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
looks more spooky than scary

1937
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and psychologically

1938
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
taught or whatever

1939
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
yeah that's more like existentially

1940
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
scary I think yeah I can handle

1941
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
that more than like a simple

1942
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
jump scare cause I'm

1943
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
a fool I'm very easily

1944
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
like putting

1945
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
hands in front of my head

1946
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm a fool

1947
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
yeah no it's a I also

1948
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
for years of course was just like Gremlins

1949
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I was like this I've said this a hundred times in the show

1950
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
this is a snuff film that I will never see

1951
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
was the thought I had as a child

1952
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I was terrified of Gremlins as a kid

1953
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
the ultimate little guys

1954
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and then especially two obviously I'm just

1955
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
like this is a Looney Tunes cartoon

1956
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
was made to be a Looney Tunes cartoon basically

1957
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
but it is so it's like

1958
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
oh it's like going to a comic book convention

1959
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
when I was 12

1960
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
it's like they were right next to each other the comics

1961
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and the horror stuff and I was just like this is for me

1962
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
this is not and you're like actually they're the same thing

1963
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
it's just like sometimes there's like a gross

1964
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
cut on the movie

1965
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
or like in the comics or whatever like it's gross

1966
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
yeah I was a very easily

1967
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
frightened kid like I did not like

1968
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
scary movies growing up I think getting

1969
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
into scary movies it was kind of a

1970
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
it was a weird like shift

1971
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
where I was like oh I

1972
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
you know working my way up through like

1973
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
more and more intense scares

1974
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and stuff and kind of learning to appreciate them

1975
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I found personally like I don't know

1976
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
empowering in a way where it was like oh

1977
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I can like deal with this and I

1978
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
can appreciate this and I've come to really love

1979
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
it for that reason it's a reason a lot of people

1980
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
are drawn to it is it's like

1981
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
you know kind of pushing yourself

1982
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
to see what you can handle and there's

1983
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
always the you can always turn it

1984
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
off you know this is what

1985
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
when Scott and I go to this

1986
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
this is what I will tell him that he needs to do like three

1987
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
mazes for it to almost like

1988
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
get his brain reset to it

1989
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and feel the accomplishment versus

1990
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
just the terror or shock of it

1991
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
because that's what it took

1992
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
my wife to do and that's what it took me

1993
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
to do like two or three and then you

1994
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
go okay the scare actor is

1995
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
not going to kill me and then you

1996
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
can kind of you get you're still like jumpy

1997
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
but you get a little calmer and then you do start

1998
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
to feel good about yourself

1999
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
in a way you're like wow look at me look at

2000
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
this little boy look what he's up to

2001
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
now and it does you do feel

2002
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
like a sense of accomplishment

2003
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and I feel like it is

2004
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
like a theme park ride thing like I've

2005
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
heard Tony Baxter talk about splash mountain

2006
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
he wanted it to feel like an accomplishment

2007
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
for kids so you make it

2008
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
scary going up because they really feel like

2009
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
they've overcome something and it works

2010
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that way in your 40s walking

2011
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
through a dark house

2012
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
with a bunch of people yelling at you

2013
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
like it's the kind of the same thing like and I

2014
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
guess maybe because it took me so long to do something

2015
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
like a haunted house it really I'll never

2016
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I'll never lose that like little

2017
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
look at me how about it

2018
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'm doing it

2019
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
you wanted to be a snooty little boy

2020
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I did I did want to be

2021
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
it took me forever to want to actually

2022
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
go to horror nights because at a certain point

2023
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I was like okay I'm good with horror movies

2024
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I love them at this point it's my job but I'm

2025
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
still I have that mental

2026
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
wall where I'm like I'm scared of

2027
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
people and like loud noises

2028
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
in real life like people jumping out at me took me

2029
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
along and then yeah once I just

2030
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
did a bunch it was like oh you get a

2031
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
sense of like the rhythm of them

2032
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
like you know what they're going to be

2033
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
essentially describe that yeah

2034
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
the rhythm like that you know

2035
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
how often it's going to happen you know

2036
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
you see it like because especially horror

2037
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
nights they're running so many people through those mazes

2038
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
you often see the people in front

2039
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
of you get the scare you see the people behind you

2040
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
get the scare yeah and you also then start

2041
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
to notice stuff as well okay

2042
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
that's obviously like you

2043
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
you after a while then will get impressed

2044
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
when they get you and

2045
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
then you will I do feel a sense of

2046
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
like oh wow I didn't see that coming

2047
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I have a weird I'll instinctively

2048
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
just clap

2049
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
kind of a scared clap

2050
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
oh cool great so you do see

2051
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
you start judging it based on like you tricked

2052
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
you fooled me I'm a little

2053
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
know it all I thought that that's

2054
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
and knowing a lot of people who like are really

2055
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
passionate about haunts everyone wants it

2056
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
to be fun you know there's

2057
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
oh yeah you know it's

2058
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
it's all fun no one's trying to

2059
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
actually traumatize you

2060
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
except for that one haunted I don't know

2061
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
if you guys are familiar with this that like McCamey

2062
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Manor that they just oh yeah

2063
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
that like extreme haunt that

2064
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
now fortunately

2065
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
does not exist I think because they got

2066
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
sued into oblivion oh my god

2067
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
this was oh boy McCamey Manor is like

2068
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
the nasty side of like the haunt

2069
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
kind of oh really thing

2070
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
yeah it was it was a thing

2071
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
where it was like one of those

2072
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
like immersive

2073
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
haunts where they can touch you and stuff

2074
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
yeah and this was supposed

2075
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
to be like the extreme one

2076
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
where the whole point was like we don't let you

2077
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
have a safe word kind of thing

2078
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
oh I guess maybe I don't know this stuff

2079
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
oh and this year it's grimy

2080
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Russ McCamey some very bad

2081
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
bad news ones

2082
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
okay yeah this is terrible

2083
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
to see this is in Alabama

2084
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and Tennessee yes and it's a shame

2085
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
because he

2086
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
really makes it hard

2087
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
for like other people who do the

2088
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
immersive haunts where again

2089
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
they're allowed to touch you and stuff but

2090
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
you sign waivers up the ass

2091
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
for those and those are like you get a safe

2092
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
word and that's the whole point is

2093
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
it can end anytime you want it to

2094
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
and I feel the frustration on

2095
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
you know those people's parts where it's like

2096
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
people think that that's

2097
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
what this is where it's like us torturing

2098
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
you and kind of enjoy but it's like

2099
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
no that's you know

2100
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
yeah and it sucks that that

2101
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
because that one was so sensational

2102
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and bizarre and

2103
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
that was the one that kind of got the

2104
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
reputation as you know

2105
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
what these things are like when that's just not

2106
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
this reputation is what I still

2107
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
think just the

2108
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
the insidious maze is going

2109
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
to be yes the lipstick

2110
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
demon just touching you

2111
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
yeah there's no touching

2112
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
she's going to actually take my fingernails

2113
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
off that's what their waiver said

2114
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
that it might you might have your fingernails

2115
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
removed you might get a tattoo

2116
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and you might have your teeth

2117
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
extracted yeah no no

2118
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
no no no

2119
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
no I don't care for that it is funny now

2120
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
that you know we're saying this because like one of the first

2121
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
things the first year or two of me doing this I went

2122
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
to Zombie Joe's the local

2123
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
horror theater immersive

2124
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
different they put on different productions with Eva Anderson

2125
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and it was we went in two at a time

2126
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
for this one haunt that was like a dark

2127
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
ride where we got in a little

2128
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
vehicle and they pushed us around

2129
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
and then went into a room full of

2130
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
a couple naked people but

2131
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
that's the scare for you well yeah I

2132
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
didn't care for that please

2133
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
but we signed we signed it we signed a thing

2134
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
that was like yeah they can touch you and I was like

2135
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
that's not going to be crazy right and it was

2136
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
not but thinking about it back to it now

2137
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
because the last

2138
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
room we get we got thrown in a room and then all

2139
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
the performers like basically kind of come

2140
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
up behind you and then on the sides and

2141
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
there's like a man in a devil mask and he's like

2142
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
sort of I just remember he's like stroking

2143
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Eva's face and then we just are like more

2144
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and more surrounded by all these people

2145
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
but there was something by at that point

2146
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
that I wasn't so worried about getting

2147
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
killed but now that you're saying like

2148
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I guess I did sign a waiver I guess

2149
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I could have had a tooth removed

2150
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
or like this is how you get this to stop

2151
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
kind of thing it was pretty short

2152
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I think it was like six to eight

2153
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
minutes I did what Jason Waller did

2154
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and Landon did it

2155
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I think they went together now to think about it

2156
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
but I remember two would go in at a time and it would

2157
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
be eight minutes but there was some paperwork

2158
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
before the paperwork

2159
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
said no safe words the paperwork I guess paperwork

2160
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
said no safe words so I think I think they were they were

2161
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
like this is too short to even have it you just

2162
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
got to finish it out yeah wasn't

2163
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
that one in North Hollywood

2164
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
yeah it's still that that's always where they've had

2165
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
shows and stuff so like there

2166
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
is a karaoke bar and a house

2167
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
of pies down the block like I feel

2168
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
like that maybe takes out some of the

2169
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
like really big fear

2170
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
you don't think you can get a tooth removed in a building near

2171
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Idelauer the big barrel

2172
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
the barrel yeah you can get a tooth

2173
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
pulled out of with the pliers

2174
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
yeah it doesn't stop anybody from taking

2175
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
your teeth out yeah you're just

2176
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
trying to get through and you're like oh I can go to the new

2177
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Randy's Donuts location

2178
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and it's still open

2179
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
but if you're all your teeth are gone Randy's not going to be too

2180
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
fun for you well but if you get a raised

2181
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
one you can at least gum it

2182
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
he's right about that

2183
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
lucky you never give up spirit of Jason

2184
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I can just gum

2185
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
the previous tenant ate salt fish and chips

2186
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
was a little more

2187
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
unreliable for eating

2188
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
a little more reliable

2189
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
texture wise

2190
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
yeah so anyway

2191
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
no one's going to touch you

2192
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
no one's going to touch you on purpose

2193
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
sometimes it happens on accident

2194
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and you can tell the

2195
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
performers like you know they flinch a little bit

2196
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
like oh shit you know

2197
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I saw something

2198
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
this year the day we went that

2199
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I thought actually was very cute

2200
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
there are these giant stilt

2201
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
performers that are like big crows

2202
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
they have light up red eyes and they're

2203
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
really cool looking I saw

2204
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
a woman holding up her hand

2205
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
like flat and I saw the

2206
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
crow pretending

2207
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
to eat out of her palm

2208
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and I just thought it was so cute

2209
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
it was just like oh giving him bird seed

2210
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
that's nice

2211
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I believe there's a baby

2212
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
crow this year too

2213
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I don't know maybe that was added

2214
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I think the giant stilt walker

2215
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
there might be a nest with a baby

2216
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
yeah there's a nest with

2217
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
like an animatronic kind of little baby

2218
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
crow in there I did see one of the big

2219
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
crows proudly showing

2220
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
off the little baby

2221
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
that's very cute

2222
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I can't find this thread of fake ETs but I

2223
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
there's one like Nuki

2224
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Nuki I know Nuki

2225
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I'm familiar with Nuki

2226
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm scared of Nuki

2227
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
yeah I don't like Nuki off the bat

2228
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
maybe I would if I saw the movie

2229
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
squirm and all these guys

2230
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
let me go back to Hitchcock

2231
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
do you remember what age you all were

2232
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
when you first saw Psycho?

2233
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
probably film school

2234
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
yeah I might have been

2235
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
like college

2236
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
the first Hitchcock I ever saw was the birds

2237
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
it scared the shit out of me

2238
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I loved it

2239
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I

2240
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
again we were a big Hitchcock

2241
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
family and

2242
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Nickelodeon and Nick at Nights

2243
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
set it up so Saturday nights

2244
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
it's Nick are you afraid the Darkwood era

2245
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Alfred Hitchcock presents

2246
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
will be right after it so I would see

2247
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
that and then down at Universal

2248
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
they hit the Hitchcock show

2249
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
in Florida so we're like okay

2250
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
let's rent some of these movies

2251
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
so we rent it Psycho

2252
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and the shower scene

2253
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
scared me so much

2254
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
from then on any time I would take

2255
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
a bath or shower I would lock

2256
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
the door which is probably

2257
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
not great as like a clumsy

2258
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
eleven or twelve year old

2259
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
to lock yourself out of the bathroom

2260
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
the faucet broke

2261
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and shot up my butt

2262
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
tell me we can't we can't

2263
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
but yeah

2264
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that scare like

2265
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
until basically

2266
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
going to college and shared dorm

2267
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
bathroom

2268
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I was like oh I can't lock the bathroom

2269
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
oh no you had to get over it

2270
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
it's scary

2271
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
the sound too especially

2272
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
is so effective

2273
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I think there's like the story where

2274
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
they're stabbing like cantaloupes

2275
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and stuff to make that kind of

2276
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
well if we want

2277
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
some of the real intel about some of these

2278
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
things I'm going to bust out a document

2279
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
a sacred document that I don't think I brought out for a long time

2280
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
this is

2281
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
the actual official

2282
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
universal studio

2283
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
guide manual

2284
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
the sacred Jedi

2285
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
text

2286
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I'm not letting these burn up

2287
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
yeah how about this so this is

2288
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
not only the real script

2289
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
at least at the time of how you're

2290
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
supposed to take people through it but then

2291
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
there's like you have a bunch of stall

2292
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
material you have the if you were

2293
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
to get stuck up there how would you

2294
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and I you know you were talking earlier

2295
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
about like your friend cares about the history

2296
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
of it I was reading all I'm like

2297
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I don't think I got stuck up there in any

2298
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
it's not a place if you know the flow of the

2299
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
tour you're not getting stuck up there yeah there's not like

2300
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
an intersection or anything

2301
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
no there'd be nothing to wait for

2302
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
where you get stuck is when you're waiting for like

2303
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
oh we're trying to get into earthquake

2304
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
but you know the other trams aren't

2305
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
through it all the way so there's no

2306
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
you would never get stuck but I feel like the people

2307
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
put this together love the

2308
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
movie so much that they're like

2309
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
we'll give them eight different big

2310
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
paragraphs they can read because I want

2311
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
to write it I I enjoy writing

2312
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
it so much it's it's fine I

2313
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
think that okay because I think the cantaloupe thing

2314
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
is mentioned the sound you hear in the

2315
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
scene was created by knife being plunged into a helpless

2316
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
cassava melon oh cassava

2317
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
now we have the type even how about that

2318
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and Hitchcock himself felled the knife

2319
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
for some of the close ups I didn't know that

2320
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
what chocolate syrup

2321
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
was the blood oh they love saying

2322
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
that's a universal classic

2323
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
black and white so it was a chocolate syrup

2324
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I didn't know it was

2325
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
not Anthony Perkins

2326
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
that was if I didn't realize till

2327
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I don't think I must have not read this at the time

2328
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I just not in the entire

2329
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
scene it's not him he was in New York

2330
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
doing a play okay not him at all

2331
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
because it took days and days to film

2332
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
why seven days of filming and

2333
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
over 70 different cuts him doing

2334
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
that play is why at the end of Psycho

2335
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
when he screams he doesn't make any noise

2336
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and originally it was a

2337
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
okay pretend you're screaming

2338
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
we'll dub it later and apparently

2339
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
just in the edit they're like it's kind of

2340
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
creepy that he doesn't make any sounds

2341
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
so they just whoa

2342
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
he was saving his voice for that

2343
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Broadway stuff he was doing oh that's cool wow

2344
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
wow do you have anything else

2345
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
jumped out of here

2346
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
boy so many

2347
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
so many oh my you're not yeah lots of

2348
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
yeah this is the most like

2349
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
this is just a messy

2350
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
by the way

2351
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Mike you were referring to this

2352
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
syndrome on the show of like not this year

2353
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
not this year not ready I've punted

2354
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
the tram tour so many times

2355
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and again I will say not

2356
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
this year not ready

2357
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm really glad we've peeled off this

2358
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
aspect of it but I'm I don't

2359
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
even wanna I you don't want

2360
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
to commit to next year I don't want to commit to next

2361
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
year but I've I really have thought about

2362
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
the tram tour and and like

2363
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I mean because I think it's like a month long event

2364
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
is what I've got away I think it'll

2365
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
it can work

2366
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
we were talking about at the very

2367
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
beginning of 2020

2368
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
of like maybe in a few months

2369
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and then we're waylaid by

2370
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
a worldwide pandemic and

2371
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
you and Aaron had a child yes

2372
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
yeah there's always stuff so

2373
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
so again I will

2374
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
say not this year not this year but

2375
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I would I would love to figure it out for next

2376
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
year so this hopefully this this document

2377
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
is getting some play and I can just read

2378
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
from the from the thing which I

2379
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
like to do because

2380
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
this actually brings up an interesting aspect

2381
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
that's no longer true of the

2382
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Bates Motel on the tour but that

2383
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
there's this hard pivot

2384
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
because for a long time they left

2385
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
up some of the Whoville

2386
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
sets from the Jim Carrey

2387
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Grinch oh yeah during Grinchmas

2388
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
you get a little song and dance

2389
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
you get yes sometimes there were both of

2390
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
these things sometimes you would pull up get

2391
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
a little song and dance something else I didn't

2392
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
know about until it was happening in front of me

2393
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and like what I was in the

2394
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
middle of a sentence and then like we welcome

2395
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
you oh okay I better shut up

2396
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
and then you around the corner and then Norman

2397
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Bates comes out like that's the live entertainment

2398
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
zone yeah the tour

2399
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
up there but also for a

2400
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
long time you'd be looking at the Bates Motel

2401
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
and then there's like big

2402
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
crazy curvy thing

2403
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
of my bobs back there which

2404
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
sort of take away the scariness although

2405
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
except those were getting real decrepit too

2406
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
yeah Derby and Whoville

2407
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I remember they were very sun faded

2408
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
by the end yeah

2409
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
cracking apart

2410
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
but you add to

2411
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
they're like well we gotta help people transition

2412
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
because that's a tough like

2413
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
how do you swing from that to from Whoville

2414
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
the residents of Whoville had to put up with

2415
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
a lot more than a Grinch out here on the back

2416
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
lot they lived right next door to Norman Bates

2417
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
on your right are two of the most

2418
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
famous and then like little jokes you could do

2419
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
anyone feel like taking a break maybe grabbing

2420
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
a shower

2421
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
which is that's the only time doing that job

2422
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
you're allowed to ask the guests

2423
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
if they want to take a shower

2424
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
any other setting you would

2425
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and should be fired at that point too

2426
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
like years in like how many

2427
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
people remember that there's a shower scene in Psycho

2428
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I mean a lot but like is it

2429
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
60%

2430
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I want to give people credit and say

2431
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
that it's like because has not the Psycho

2432
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
has not Psycho in the shower scene

2433
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
has not become like one of that like

2434
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
that's one of the famous scenes anyone knows

2435
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
yeah yeah

2436
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
it exists now as one of the

2437
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
only movies the way like time

2438
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
fades away all these bands are gone

2439
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Flattens history yeah yeah

2440
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I think that's one of the ones that's left

2441
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
do we think that it's a deserved thing

2442
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
that Psycho is like the one

2443
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I think so from like a horror

2444
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
perspective especially it changed

2445
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
so much when you look at

2446
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
what horror was like before and

2447
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
after it's crazy I mean I took a class

2448
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
in college that was like the horror film

2449
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
1960 so Psycho

2450
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
to present because it was such

2451
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
a big change

2452
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
in terms of like what he showed

2453
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
what he implied the subject matter

2454
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
everything I think totally and the fact

2455
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that it just made America go

2456
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
kind of crazy especially

2457
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
the fact that it has become

2458
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
something you can watch with your family

2459
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
is so weird

2460
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
when you think about

2461
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
the way that movie was received

2462
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
when it was released it genuinely

2463
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
was very controversial

2464
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
oh and promote it yeah just like

2465
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
don't learn anything about it

2466
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
yes he wouldn't let you in

2467
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
you can't come in after it starts

2468
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
that stuff

2469
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that has a bit like

2470
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
this is like the beginning of

2471
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
spoilers and potential spoilers

2472
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I just recently I was in

2473
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Tampa for a horror convention

2474
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and my husband and I took a tour of the Tampa

2475
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Theater which is a beautiful old

2476
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
like like a movie pad like a proper movie

2477
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
palace it's beautiful and

2478
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I learned on that tour that

2479
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
pre Psycho

2480
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
specifically it was

2481
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
common to like because movies

2482
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
would play almost in like a loop all

2483
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
day so you could like just show up

2484
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
halfway through one and sit through it

2485
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and then see the first half like that wasn't

2486
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
uncommon and

2487
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
the reason that we have like

2488
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
you know you get to a movie

2489
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
on time is because of Psycho

2490
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
and Hitchcock specifically

2491
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
telling exhibitors like you cannot

2492
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
let people in right halfway

2493
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
through because it's just going to ruin

2494
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
they would just ambiently play

2495
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
like the Disneyland

2496
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
silent movie theater

2497
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I could be wrong but my

2498
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
from what I remember of that tour it was

2499
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
like yeah you buy your ticket price and you

2500
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
kind of you just want to say yeah

2501
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
it is almost like the

2502
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
like a theme park style or it's just

2503
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
playing a loop of something

2504
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I've never heard that

2505
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
that's really cool wow geez

2506
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
this is all mega history

2507
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
my other

2508
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
like weird little

2509
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
kid I guess pre teen

2510
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
kind of Anthony Perkins memory

2511
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
do any of you know about the book or

2512
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
film on the beach

2513
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
yeah I think you told me about it

2514
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
yeah so this is a book

2515
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
like

2516
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
the book Psycho it was a best seller

2517
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
and then it became a movie

2518
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
it is a book

2519
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
about there is a nuclear war

2520
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
and the surviving

2521
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
remnants of humanity are

2522
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
left down in Australia

2523
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
and they

2524
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
know their time the clock is

2525
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
ticking because the nuclear winds the

2526
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
nuclear winter is coming

2527
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
and I read

2528
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
this book in ninth grade

2529
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I really enjoyed it I forget why

2530
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
we read it in ninth grade I

2531
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
think we were doing like suspense

2532
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
and genre stuff because we read

2533
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
and then there were none as well

2534
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
but the movie

2535
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
version stars Anthony

2536
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Perkins and I remember

2537
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
being so excited

2538
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
when the teacher told

2539
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
oh this movie

2540
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
it's an old movie it's black and white it stars

2541
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Anthony Perkins and I was like

2542
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
he's Norman Bates

2543
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
guys did you hear that

2544
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
no one else gave a shit

2545
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
absolutely no one else

2546
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
gave a shit about this

2547
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
likely more interested

2548
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
in Limp Bizkit and

2549
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
American Badass Undertaker

2550
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
so this is like 1999?

2551
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
99 2000 and I was just

2552
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
they're the fools

2553
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I liked Anthony Perkins in

2554
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
1999 and Mankind

2555
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I liked all of the different

2556
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I knew all the lyrics that Limp Bizkit

2557
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
breaks stuff

2558
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
yeah doesn't Mankind also like

2559
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
love his mom isn't that a thing?

2560
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I forget if that's part of his character

2561
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
initially Mankind was a very

2562
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Mrs Foley's baby boy

2563
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
that's right Mrs Foley's baby boy

2564
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Mrs Bates baby boy

2565
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
initially the Mankind character was a very tortured

2566
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
pulling his hair out hitting himself

2567
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
he lived in the boiler room

2568
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and he had a feud with Undertaker

2569
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
but then I think Mick himself talks about

2570
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
how Mankind turned from that into a

2571
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
human muppet of like kind of a

2572
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
silly guy with a funny mask

2573
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
he had a big like dress shirt untucked

2574
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and he had a sock

2575
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Mr sock

2576
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
his finishing move was the mandible claw

2577
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
and he had like this kind of leather strap around

2578
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and he'd shove it in somebody's mouth

2579
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and put like some sort of pressure

2580
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
like the idea was a pressure point on your tongue or something

2581
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and just knock you out or whatever

2582
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
and then that turned into he put a sock

2583
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
with a smiley face on his hand

2584
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and put it in somebody's mouth

2585
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and it was Mr Socko

2586
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
and they sold Mr Sockos

2587
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
like sweatpants he was wearing around that time

2588
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
we have an autograph of Mr Socko

2589
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
that is very impressive

2590
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
very cool

2591
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I forgot the other more recent

2592
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Anthony Perkins fact his son

2593
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Oz Perkins

2594
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
director of Long Legs

2595
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
the recent film Long Legs

2596
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Long Legs is definitely

2597
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
like his best

2598
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I love Long Legs

2599
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I'm excited he's got another movie coming out

2600
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
that's a Stephen King adaptation called Monkey

2601
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
really looking forward to

2602
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
yeah we got to

2603
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
this was very cool and is

2604
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
humble bragging I apologize

2605
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
we got to see Long Legs

2606
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
very early the Neon

2607
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
the studio contacted my husband

2608
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and I were like hey we want

2609
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
you two to see this first

2610
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
we were like yes

2611
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
yeah hell yeah

2612
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and they were like hey pick a theater we'll set up a screening

2613
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
we get there and Oz is there

2614
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Oz came there to meet us and tell us

2615
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
about his movie and he was super cool

2616
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
and afterwards it then hit

2617
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
me like that's Anthony Perkins son

2618
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
you know what I mean it was just a weird like

2619
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
and he looks so much like his dad

2620
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and then I also thought he was

2621
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
illegally bought

2622
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
pretty good

2623
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
that's a fascinating filmography

2624
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
for sure

2625
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I think it's a cool like he's really

2626
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
like you know I think it's

2627
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
cool that he's really made a name for himself

2628
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
as a filmmaker and then

2629
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
the afterthought is oh yeah he's

2630
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Anthony Perkins

2631
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
that's the dream yeah

2632
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
he's like really transcended

2633
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
that kind of you know to where it becomes

2634
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
trivia about him like he's also

2635
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
related to so and so

2636
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
similar in the horror genre

2637
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
the very successful writer

2638
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Joe Hill is

2639
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Stephen King's son

2640
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
okay what has he written I'm sorry

2641
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
The Black Phone

2642
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
oh yeah yeah The Black Phone

2643
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I'm wondering about all

2644
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
the kids today yes

2645
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
he is Norman

2646
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
in Psycho 2

2647
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
he's young Norman yeah wow

2648
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Psycho 4 that's the

2649
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
ET what's that actor's name

2650
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Henry Thomas

2651
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
do you have I'm fascinated

2652
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
by this because like I feel like it's

2653
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Quentin Tarantino or something interviewer he

2654
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
was like Psycho 2 is better than Psycho 1

2655
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
do you have any what's your like most

2656
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
controversial takes

2657
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
on movies in this in this

2658
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
in this vein of like a take

2659
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
like Psycho 2 better than one

2660
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
which is hilarious oh boy I like

2661
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Psycho 2 uh like

2662
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
like horror in general

2663
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I mean if anything in general

2664
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
but is it one where you're like you know what like Jaws

2665
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
5 is actually the best

2666
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I genuinely unironically

2667
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
like Human Centipede

2668
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I think it's really good okay

2669
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I am a little scared to watch that one too

2670
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I've done Human Centipede

2671
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
it's so insane

2672
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
it's almost like it's just this other

2673
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
it does the same thing

2674
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
that I love about

2675
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Texas Chainsaw Massacre where your

2676
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
memory of it is that you

2677
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
saw so much stuff

2678
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
that you didn't see because

2679
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
it's like

2680
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
filmed to where it's

2681
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I don't know I just think it's they're both very

2682
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
clever in like the way that they obscure

2683
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
things and hide and it makes

2684
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
it makes you fill in all the

2685
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
gross stuff but then there's the Human

2686
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Centipede sequels that are like fuck it we're just gonna show

2687
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
you we're gonna do what you thought the

2688
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
first movie was and that's

2689
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
more process let's see how

2690
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I haven't seen the other ones do you find

2691
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
out too much about the digestive

2692
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
situation

2693
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
you know it's

2694
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
yeah it's more about like

2695
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
it's a series of like just shocking

2696
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
yeah listen also

2697
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
isn't the surgeon who I think

2698
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
is fantastic I mean I'll go

2699
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
back and just like less the like

2700
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
true horror of it and more just watch him like

2701
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
explain the situation

2702
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
what I'm doing but then doesn't buy

2703
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
buy a couple in isn't it like

2704
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
yeehaw I'm the sheriff now

2705
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
same guy but he's

2706
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
in a cowboy hat

2707
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
there's like the big there's like I think the third

2708
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
one is like it's a giant prison complex

2709
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I don't know

2710
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I don't really mess with the Human Centipede

2711
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
do you think there

2712
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
if you were imagining like I guess

2713
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
it could be any horror movie like a Human Centipede maze

2714
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
at Horror Nights

2715
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
something like

2716
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
would that be something that makes sense

2717
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
or is there's another movie that you would be

2718
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
like oh I'd love to walk through

2719
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I think a Suspiria maze would be really

2720
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
cool just cause of all the colors

2721
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
and stuff the problem is like

2722
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
so many movies that I think oh this would be a cool

2723
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
maze you realize how

2724
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
kind of like we were talking about with a

2725
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
psycho themed walkthrough of the hotel

2726
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
it's like well you just have like

2727
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
a bunch of Norman Bates

2728
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
what is that you know

2729
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
how do you have like constant stuff instead of when

2730
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
a lot of movies are like building up to one big scare

2731
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
yeah where there's one villain

2732
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
or like one kind of set piece

2733
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
it's like well how do you

2734
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
like something like Ghostbusters works

2735
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
well cause there's all kinds of

2736
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
creepy crawlies

2737
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I guess it's more at Knott's

2738
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
at Scary Farm there is I forget which maze

2739
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I feel like there was one maze where there weren't

2740
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
a lot of jump scares and I couldn't

2741
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
tell if it was because everybody was on their break

2742
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
that happens sometimes

2743
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
if you catch a maze at the wrong

2744
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
time like we went through

2745
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
there was we walked into a room and it was

2746
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
clearly supposed to be something

2747
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
happening and it was just kind of empty

2748
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
it happens when does it happen

2749
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
well

2750
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Scott just look for

2751
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
some mazes they move people in

2752
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and out in black cloaks

2753
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
so if I hang out at the side

2754
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I see a lot of cloaks go by

2755
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
if you look for the shift change

2756
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
if you can hear the dinner bell ring

2757
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
that's when everybody has to go eat dinner

2758
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
if I can smell fajitas

2759
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
a couple hundred feet away

2760
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
that's why I'm banned from horror nights

2761
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
when I hear the dinner bell I just start heading

2762
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
these are employees only sir stop it

2763
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
that was the best the one time

2764
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
we were talking to people

2765
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
at Knott's Berry Farm

2766
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
and like

2767
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
we're back you know

2768
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
backstage and just walking by

2769
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
a tent of people in the makeup eating

2770
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
their lunch like eating their like

2771
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
it's like it's the magic

2772
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
of comic con where you'll see the Flash

2773
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
villain Captain Cold going to the bathroom

2774
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
yeah yeah and it's like that is what

2775
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I love about comic con that was a

2776
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
legitimate startling moment we were in an

2777
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
office building I went to go to the bathroom

2778
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
you got scared you got freaked yeah a werewolf

2779
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
came out and he went oh excuse me

2780
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
you went ah you like made a noise

2781
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I did make a noise and he

2782
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
like held the door for me he was just a guy

2783
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
using the bathroom before he went back to work

2784
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
just a guy just a guy just a werewolf

2785
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
well that's what I

2786
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
that's why I was scared

2787
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
just half a guy my husband and I just did a

2788
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
set visit for something I can't say what

2789
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
it is yet just in case but we

2790
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
were at Crafty

2791
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
and the

2792
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
monster the thing

2793
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
in this movie his

2794
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
stunt double who was also fully

2795
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
in the full get up walked up next to me was

2796
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
also getting coffee and I was like this is

2797
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
this is like the studio lot experience

2798
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
that you want you know what I mean

2799
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
like a monster on break was so

2800
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
exciting yes casual monster

2801
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
so exciting yes yes well what we were saying

2802
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
that you go onto the lot and like nobody's around

2803
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and you can't it just makes it cool that you can

2804
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
just hang out on Amity then but like

2805
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I want

2806
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
facades to be wheeled by

2807
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
yeah it's like the end of Peewee's Big Adventure

2808
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
yeah yeah I want a bunch of showgirls

2809
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I know there hasn't been a movie made

2810
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
with a bunch of showgirls in decades

2811
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
but yeah

2812
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
that's the dream is they're making a

2813
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
radically different movie of every genre

2814
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
in all ten of these stages

2815
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I know yeah that would be really

2816
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I was trying to think like yeah they're using the

2817
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
flood scene

2818
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
for something and they're shooting

2819
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
what is the technical term

2820
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
for the flood the flash flood

2821
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
that's in Big Fat Liar

2822
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
yes it's kind of hard to do

2823
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
you can kind of only use it as itself

2824
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I think it's hard to write a scene where a flash flood

2825
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
happens organically

2826
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
have they ever died that

2827
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
red or am I making that up?

2828
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that would be cool

2829
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I'm sure you could but that's a

2830
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
huge effort they die the lake in

2831
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Chicago green for St. Patrick's Day

2832
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
that's a lot of water

2833
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
so they should have a blood flood

2834
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
they should have a blood flood

2835
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
that's a million dollar title

2836
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
right there hopefully more than a million

2837
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
it's a hundred million dollar title

2838
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
all right great

2839
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I'll write in direct blood flood

2840
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
wow

2841
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
and then you're long gone

2842
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and we're talking about you like I should

2843
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
my controversial take blood flood

2844
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
three there

2845
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
that's where it really came into its own

2846
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
and I will declare I will have written and

2847
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
shot blood flood by next year

2848
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I will declare that next year

2849
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
this year

2850
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I will commit to going into production

2851
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
blood flood in the next few months

2852
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
that's a good goal post you can get that done

2853
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and Jason Sheridan is a star

2854
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
of blood flood

2855
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
very annoying when you're using

2856
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
your blood flood concept to do

2857
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
money laundering

2858
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and a movie never gets made

2859
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
it'll be a big scam

2860
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
it'll be a big Kickstarter scandal

2861
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
you're not delivering rewards

2862
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
we've all given money to big scams on

2863
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Kickstarter

2864
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I love the updates

2865
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
people we know

2866
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
people I would know for years like I need money for a movie

2867
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and then five years later I go huh

2868
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
that didn't come out did it

2869
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I need money for an escape

2870
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
did I get the money back I don't think so

2871
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I need money for a new identity

2872
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
a person who fled the city

2873
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I wonder where they are now

2874
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
sorry

2875
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
looking forward to blood flood

2876
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
the twisted mind of Mike Carlson

2877
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
what have we missed anything else about

2878
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
the aspects of the psycho

2879
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
experience or the house

2880
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
has Norman ever been in

2881
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
just the parks or is he always

2882
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
over here

2883
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
that's a good question I've never seen him in the parks

2884
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I don't know if he's just walking around

2885
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I've never seen him walking around the parks

2886
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
but I guess

2887
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
because Frankenstein, Dracula they're still around

2888
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
they're always walking around

2889
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
they look funny no matter where

2890
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
they are in the park

2891
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
there's not a good spot for them

2892
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
they'll be walking around

2893
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
we went during Grinchmas

2894
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and they were right by Whoville

2895
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
which I liked a lot

2896
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
yeah

2897
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I think recently

2898
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
yeah they're just on the main street

2899
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
but then the mystery

2900
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
machine and Scooby Doo gang are

2901
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
feet away from them

2902
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I like when they interact

2903
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I like it

2904
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I like it

2905
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Frankenstein and they just have a conversation and character

2906
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I wonder if

2907
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
there was any Norman Bates ever walking around

2908
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and if that would even be

2909
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
identifiable outside of

2910
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
being in front of Bates Motel

2911
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
because he is just a guy

2912
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
it was videos of

2913
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Loki

2914
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
where they had a Loki face character

2915
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
walking around but it was him from

2916
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
so it was just a guy

2917
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
it just looked like a guy that kind of

2918
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
looked like Tom Hiddleston

2919
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Loki and all the

2920
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
different outfits

2921
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
without the horns it's not so

2922
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
identifiable

2923
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
she's just a guy with a knife

2924
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
yes

2925
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Lucille Ball is still in the park

2926
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
there's still a woman playing Lucille Ball

2927
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and I guess that's more identifiable

2928
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
than Norman Bates

2929
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
but that is still old

2930
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
most people don't dress like that

2931
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I am impressed Lucy is still

2932
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
in those parks

2933
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
she's been dead for many

2934
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
decades now at this point

2935
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I want her to go away don't get me wrong

2936
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
you know me I want her there forever

2937
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I am shocked that she's still there

2938
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I wonder if that was ever

2939
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
the man in a kind of a suit

2940
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
it's like a brown suit

2941
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
when it's translated to color

2942
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
in real life it's like a brown suit

2943
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
and a blue shirt

2944
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
obviously it's all black and white in the movie

2945
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Scott I wanted to mention you

2946
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I know you're usually the John Forsythe

2947
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
keeper

2948
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
the universal souvenir videos

2949
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
oh yeah

2950
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
or these mealy mouthed intros

2951
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
from old actor John Forsythe

2952
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
movies are the wizards wand

2953
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
so there's the one for universal

2954
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Hollywood the one for universal Florida

2955
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and I scrubbed the Hollywood one

2956
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
and I was hooping

2957
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
like if it was more modern like whoopee

2958
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
or something they would have been menaced by Norman

2959
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
but John Forsythe

2960
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
did not goof around with Norman Bates

2961
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
what they had with him

2962
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
he was in front of the psycho house

2963
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
with a Hitchcock silhouette graphic

2964
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and then it slid away

2965
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and John Forsythe was standing

2966
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
sideways

2967
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and then he was like Alfred Hitchcock

2968
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
and the magic of the movie

2969
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
so there was no Norman Bates

2970
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
John Forsythe action unfortunately

2971
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
that's a shame

2972
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I did just remember though there was a video

2973
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I was just trying to remember

2974
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
what the general gist of the

2975
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
what does Norman do when he runs out

2976
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and it's you know

2977
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
it's like you maybe

2978
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
see him for a second possibly

2979
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
before he comes out with

2980
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
a body

2981
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
that feels like Janet Leigh

2982
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
and then puts it in the trunk

2983
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
cool car they got

2984
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
it's all set up great

2985
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
and then he kind of spots the tram

2986
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
that's the last aspect I like about it

2987
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
is that you're a part of it

2988
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
and that you're like your witnesses now

2989
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
so he's like it's not

2990
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
arbitrary really that he's coming after you

2991
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
and then

2992
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
you get just like a good

2993
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
fast walk that you know

2994
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
you probably get the biggest scare in the back

2995
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
because maybe he swipes at you

2996
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
but then just kind of stares

2997
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and it's still scary even though nothing happened

2998
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I remember like one time we rode the tram

2999
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
and I made a point to kind of look

3000
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
and see how long he stares

3001
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
he watches you pull away

3002
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
you don't get a reset

3003
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
he's not resetting immediately

3004
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
they're all committed

3005
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
it's great

3006
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I have seen variation

3007
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
he reaches into his coat

3008
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
and pulls out a cleaver

3009
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
and starts chasing the tram

3010
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
and what I don't think they've done in a while

3011
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
is that

3012
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
so he man dogs the tram

3013
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
tram goes up the hill

3014
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
he runs up the stairs and comes after the tram

3015
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
again

3016
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
scared the hell out of people

3017
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
but I think it is a little dangerous

3018
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
to run up steep

3019
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
stairs steps with no railing

3020
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
yeah and that's a steep hill

3021
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
going up

3022
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
dangerous seeming stairs yes true

3023
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
that is scary I had that happen once

3024
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
and then it's never happened again

3025
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
and I'm always like a little bit like is he going to be there

3026
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
is he going to be at the top of the hill

3027
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
wow all that

3028
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
it's cool they established it

3029
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
sometimes it comes out of the house

3030
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
sometimes it comes down the steps I feel like

3031
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
yeah I have

3032
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
maybe I haven't seen the house

3033
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
maybe logic please but it is funny to think about

3034
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Norman he's okay in reality

3035
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
what's happening he's killed a woman

3036
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
he's putting her in the trunk in the middle

3037
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
of the day he looks over

3038
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
there are 150 people

3039
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
looking what is his plan

3040
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
he's going to run over and stab all 150

3041
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
people very fast

3042
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
he does not have a lot of time

3043
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
with one single knife with one

3044
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
knife so he's going to run over

3045
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
and then yeah I don't know he does I don't know if he has

3046
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
a second like I don't know if in the narrative he actually

3047
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
is getting us I guess we just

3048
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
narrowly get away

3049
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
and you'd have to come up with this plan

3050
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
really fast and I don't

3051
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
know his working knowledge of the universal

3052
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
tram tour because I don't know the reality

3053
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
where this is

3054
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I assume it doesn't go by his

3055
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
house in this world every five

3056
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
minutes I would assume that but

3057
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
yeah I think you'd have to

3058
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
go for the driver first

3059
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
to get that thing to stop moving or the tires

3060
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
oh maybe it is tires that

3061
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
maybe that is what he's doing

3062
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
a lot of tires though you're

3063
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
probably right but well if you get one

3064
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that might stop it and then you get more

3065
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
tires so it would take a little while

3066
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I feel like to dig with a regular knife

3067
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
through a big thick tire and you're tired

3068
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
because you just you just stabbed we know the scene

3069
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
he just stabbed

3070
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
many times he had to

3071
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
change out of the mother costume

3072
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
right that too he's already

3073
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
done a wardrobe change

3074
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
so maybe he's cooled down he's cooled down

3075
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
yeah he's in a different outfit

3076
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
because in the movie

3077
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
the reason the Bates motel is

3078
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
so empty is he complains like you know they built

3079
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
the highway so no one comes by

3080
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
there anymore you think look

3081
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
at all these potential customers to

3082
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
fill the rest of the shoes

3083
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
yeah he might be

3084
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
in his best interest to just like throw

3085
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
the knife away and

3086
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
then she passed out

3087
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
from hot tub fumes

3088
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
she was enjoying our amenities

3089
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
too much she'll be back around in no time

3090
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
you'll see does Norman ever

3091
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
kill in the first one he's

3092
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
always wearing the mother outfit when he kills

3093
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I believe

3094
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I don't think

3095
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
there's ever because he's wearing it even in the end he has just

3096
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
the wig on or something

3097
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
there was an equally

3098
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
scary scene where the private

3099
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
detective

3100
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
detective Arborgast

3101
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
yes

3102
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Arborgast

3103
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
like it's overhead and Norma

3104
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
runs out of the room so fast

3105
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
and that scared the hell out of me

3106
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
because I was just trying to figure out if

3107
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
maybe he doesn't kill the tram because he's

3108
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
not mother but

3109
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
at the end of Psycho 2 he hits

3110
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
he kills his real spoiler alert he kills

3111
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
his real mother with a shovel

3112
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
as dressed as Norman

3113
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
so I guess they in continuity

3114
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
he kills then just dressed as regular

3115
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Norman oh sure so I'm just trying to

3116
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I'm just trying to piece together

3117
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
exactly where he is in his life in this moment

3118
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and what his plan

3119
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
might have been he's killed yeah

3120
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
right so he knows he kills

3121
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
as Norman but it's his biggest

3122
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
challenge this is like

3123
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
when Deadpool and Wolverine have to fight all of

3124
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
the deadpools oh my god can you imagine

3125
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
an action sequence where Norman

3126
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
kills 150 tram tour people

3127
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
in like slow mo

3128
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
just a bunch of blonde women pull up on the

3129
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
tram like oh my god

3130
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
he'd have the easiest time

3131
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
that's what he's used to

3132
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
miss USA

3133
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
pageant rolls up

3134
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
it's like the bus

3135
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
of all the Lucy's in

3136
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
rat race

3137
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
it's like a bunch of like

3138
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Maryland convention

3139
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
that's good yeah that's really good

3140
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
he looks at camera like no this I can

3141
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
do

3142
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
like dubstep music plays

3143
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
or something oh the theme remixed

3144
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
yeah oh yeah there you go

3145
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
it would be very funny

3146
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
to see the property manager

3147
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
of the universe backlog go like

3148
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
oh Norman yeah

3149
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
he's a little strange but

3150
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
he hasn't been the same since the

3151
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
universal Hilton at Sheraton opened

3152
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
and took away the business

3153
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
it's in canon

3154
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
yeah yeah a lot more room

3155
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
sure but none of the charm

3156
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I'm gonna have you deliver that line in blood flood

3157
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
about the main character

3158
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
of blood flood oh okay

3159
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I haven't figured out it yet but

3160
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
you'll be managing maybe

3161
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
managing the hotels I don't know I'm not sure yet

3162
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
nobody comes to see my downhill

3163
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
road anymore

3164
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
all I know is that Jason's character is gonna talk about hotels

3165
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
a lot that's all I know

3166
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
a lot of hotel talk and he knows

3167
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
that like the back of his hand yeah

3168
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
the thread count on sheets

3169
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and then the different amenities

3170
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
and the different why are all

3171
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
hotel bathrooms barn doors now

3172
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
you know just the whole scene about that

3173
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
the barn doors get me started

3174
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
actually you know what

3175
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
that's what causes the blood flood

3176
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I hate to make this go longer but what do you think

3177
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
about the barn doors Jason

3178
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
okay

3179
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
this isn't coming out for a while now

3180
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
but the air condition

3181
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
at my apartment crapped out

3182
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
so I am currently

3183
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
in the same heat that kept me away from

3184
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
horror nights

3185
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
the bathroom door is normal

3186
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
but the headboards on the beds

3187
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
are barn doors

3188
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
and I

3189
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
we were talking about it's like I'm okay

3190
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
with it I'm more okay with this

3191
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
than the barn doors as bathroom doors

3192
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
at least you have so much privacy

3193
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
you know

3194
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I

3195
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I'm fascinated I didn't even realize this barn

3196
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
door thing has been taking the hotel world by storm

3197
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
where like the door slides open

3198
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
it's just you have to if you're staying

3199
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
in a room with someone you better be like pretty

3200
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
comfortable with that

3201
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
okay well I'll keep an eye out for it

3202
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
beware of barn

3203
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
well that's an update you have to make in a new

3204
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
psycho what Norman would have to have a barn

3205
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
door in the motel you have to add one new

3206
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
line so we recently renovated got all

3207
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
barn doors now

3208
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
there's no sound

3209
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
you know that's the thing is you

3210
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
can hear everything with the barn door

3211
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
you can see her fiddling with it

3212
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
through the shower

3213
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
you just hear her cursing and it

3214
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
kind of

3215
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
so it's good it never works

3216
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
murder deterrent yeah sure

3217
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
yeah it's bad for the remake but it's good

3218
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
for us and it's good for you in the heat

3219
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
situation that you're less like

3220
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
with you with the fear that you've had since you

3221
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
saw the movie you were so much less likely

3222
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
to and then all you have to do with is that

3223
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
a maniac with a knife who you've

3224
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
heard and now have to fight

3225
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
oh yeah you just have a couple more

3226
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
seconds of lead time there

3227
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
at least you can get the jump on it yeah

3228
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
figure out how to slam that barn door real quick

3229
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
crush his face try to get

3230
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000

some finagling with where things live

3258
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
because the ever changing algorithm

3259
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
we have to appease it

3260
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
