1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Warning, the following podcasts may contain graphic monkey jerk-off sessions, fake teenage

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,720
cowboys who want to murder for real, and a special appearance by a monster.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,400
Chris Gether joins us for thrills and spills at New Jersey's Six Flags Great Adventure

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,680
on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast to where the hosts are often referred

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,080
to as good boys, but today we're Jersey Boys.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm Scott Garner, joined by Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,640
I'm here and I'm gonna do like an attitude but not a voice.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
This is an attitude, okay?

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,040
I want to make that a distinction.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,480
I'm not doing a voice.

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,840
I just have sort of like kind of a different authority to my person today.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
So the only that's a good move.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,760
The only person probably with any legitimacy to a Jersey voice might be Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Hi.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Yeah, sure.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,200
I spent half of my adolescent, you know, summers and then, you know, some other weekends at

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,800
the Jersey Shore growing up.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,320
So yeah, I got closer than us.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,840
And at today's topic, this was my home, Six Flags, a local Six Flags, because it's kind

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,720
of equidistant between Philadelphia and New York.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,280
Right, right.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,160
Well, yeah, this is great.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,000
I think, you know, we'll talk not just about this, but, you know, some other great theme

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,880
park destinations in the Garden State.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,720
And we're doing it with, I mean, I feel like a New Jersey expert, at least a New Jersey

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,280
native and a veteran podcaster and broadcaster, the star of the new special Half My Life.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
I'm so excited.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
Chris Gethard is here.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Jersey expert on hand for all your needs.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
So happy to be here.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,800
Thanks for having me.

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,640
Thanks for owning that.

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,560
That does seem like the case.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
You are a champion of this place.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
You didn't flee.

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,600
You aren't ashamed.

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I went back.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,920
I was out and I voluntarily went back in.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,440
Yeah, I mean, I'm on a pretty open, self-proclaimed quest to try to become like the comedy Springsteen

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,320
where like Jersey people are like, that's our guy.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I would love that.

45
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,600
That would be a huge accomplishment.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
So happy to hear happy to be here representing.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah, we've done a little.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,560
We found there's a Jersey Hall of Fame, I think we found recently.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,080
That's where I was going to go.

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Yeah.

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Are you aware of the Jersey Hall of Fame?

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I am.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
Do you think you have a way to get in?

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
I would love it more than anything.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,240
And I'm aware of it because when Springsteen got inducted, his speech, he said, just one

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,800
of the coolest things I've ever heard.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,880
You're like, that's why he's Springsteen.

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,760
He had some line in his speech about he's like, I always love to watch boxing matches

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,680
with guys from our home state because you just watch their opponent.

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,420
And when the announcer says, hail in from the great state of New Jersey, you just see

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,720
their shoulders drop a little bit because they know what they're in for.

63
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
And you're like, oh, that's the coolest.

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
You're the coolest.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,160
And such a cool idea.

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
What a cool thing.

67
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
That's so great.

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,160
Anything he says any time during especially that like Netflix special, you feel like it

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,080
was workshopped by like 50 of the smartest writers.

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,680
But you know, it just like came from the most brilliant, like poetic mind on the planet.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,200
That Hall of Fame where we for some reason, we end up talking about Southside Johnny a

72
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
lot on the show.

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
So a lot.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
When you say a lot.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Well, for like versus any other of these type of podcasts.

76
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Once or twice.

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Yeah, like a lot.

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
A lot.

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah.

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Like Doughboys.

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
They never talk about Southside Johnny.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,440
I can't imagine in what context Southside Johnny's coming up.

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
We do a lot.

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,960
We like we like your more obscure music guys on this show.

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,280
So he pops in here and there and he's in, I believe, the Hall of Fame as well.

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,880
I would be shocked if he wasn't.

87
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,480
Him and the Asbury Jukes.

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Let's get the Jukes.

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Yeah, let's get the Jukes.

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Little Steven, I believe.

91
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,160
Of course, Little Steven.

92
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,040
He may still be trapped in the hologram booth at Newark Airport where it is it's unclear

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,760
what speech he's giving in the hologram.

94
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,640
I can tell you right there.

95
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,600
You out it yourself as having spent time in Jersey but not of Jersey because you said

96
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Newark.

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Well, my Jersey.

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
That's Delaware.

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Because you're closer to Delaware.

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Where is the Norc?

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Yeah, my Jersey stomping grounds, besides outings to Six Flags Great Adventure, were South Jersey

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Point, Ocean City, Atlantic City, Wildwood occasionally for comic conventions.

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,200
My parents met in splitting a vacation, a rental house in Sea Isle City where my dad

104
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,520
and his friends were on one floor and my mom and her friends were on another floor.

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
That's beautiful.

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Perfect story.

107
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah.

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Yeah.

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,120
It lasted for like 20 plus years.

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Nice.

111
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Pretty good.

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Pretty good.

113
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
You said Newark.

114
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,480
As soon as you said Newark, I said, OK, that's the Philly influence.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,800
You also probably say Wooder.

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,760
I say, yeah, I do slip into Wooder.

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,200
It's been great with Mayor of Easttown because I can just tell people I'm from Delaware County

118
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
now and they understand.

119
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
There you go.

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,160
That's how I felt with Sopranos.

121
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Sure.

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,160
We're talking about this.

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,080
Both, I'll ask this to Jason and Chris, like your favorite park growing up, maybe this

124
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,440
is obvious, maybe I even asking this, other than like Disney World or going like your

125
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,840
favorite park that was around.

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
We're talking about Great Adventure today, right?

127
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,320
I'd have to go with that just because, first of all, it's like it's the most it's the one

128
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,920
in Jersey everybody went to.

129
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
Not everybody went to Action Park.

130
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,320
Despite all the legends of Action Park, a lot of people stayed away and it was pretty

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
remote.

132
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,880
So everybody said we would have stayed away.

133
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,920
God, when we covered it, we're like, I can't I can't get into the mind space of this at

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
all.

135
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I mean, it was heaven.

136
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
It was heaven.

137
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
It was like the floor to the flies.

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
It was everything people say.

139
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,280
Great Adventure had its own really macabre stories about it, too.

140
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,120
And I was there all the time because my father worked at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and they

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,200
used to have their company picnic there every summer.

142
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
And if you went, you got to go for that day on the picnic.

143
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,520
And then they also gave you tickets to come back another day.

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,040
So we always went to Great Adventure twice a year.

145
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,840
But then there's all the smaller places, too.

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,920
You know, your Bo Crafts, your Wild West cities.

147
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,040
There's a lot of up and down the boardwalk.

148
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,760
There's all the all the different rides.

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,280
So a lot of a lot of places in our general area, Sesame Place, Dorney Park, Hershey Park,

150
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,240
also being in the Philly scene.

151
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,960
But and then Rye Playland up near on the other side of New York, Westchester.

152
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,880
But Great Adventure felt to me like kind of the.

153
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,360
The center of gravity with theme parks that I grew up around.

154
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah, that makes sense.

155
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,200
Jason agreed.

156
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,360
Yeah, I liked Great Adventure a lot.

157
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,440
And we would we would hit a lot of those places growing up.

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,800
I mean, my family was a big park family and and a great adventure.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,040
Yeah, Dorney Park is just a quick shot up to Allentown.

160
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,560
And because we were in P.A.,

161
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,240
Hershey Park was about 90 minutes away, 90 minutes, two hours.

162
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,280
So that was our our other big one.

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,480
What about Sesame Place?

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,560
I made it down to Sesame Place a few times.

165
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
Once or twice I went to Sesame.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,400
I remember going to Sesame Place and liking all of the water attraction stuff.

167
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,440
And but knowing like I am too old to be here, like I am like nine or something.

168
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,480
And I'm like, this is even at nine or 10.

169
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,240
It's like, oh, this is I am an old child here.

170
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,280
The last time I went to Sesame Place, I went with my friend Lenny's family.

171
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,040
We're all a little too old.

172
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,840
And I it just came back to me.

173
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,600
The memory that we we actually got in trouble at Sesame Place.

174
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,520
And I looked back at it actually makes me laugh so hard because Lenny and I,

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
we were a little too old.

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,440
That's like mostly kiddie rides and ball pits and stuff, you know.

177
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,880
And we went in the lazy river or probably like eighth grade at the time.

178
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,000
And one of us noticed that there was change on the ground.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,800
So we started like diving down and picking up all the change.

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,840
And then we enlisted my friend's little brother and we just kept going around

181
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,480
and one of the lifeguards caught us and was like, you can't do that.

182
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,880
Give me all the money.

183
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,840
And we had like probably like 18 or 19 dollars between us.

184
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,480
And then we told his dad.

185
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,160
And I remember Lenny's dad was like, they probably just go through

186
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
and pick it all up at the end of the night themselves.

187
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,320
That's why they're pissed. Let's go.

188
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,160
And for some reason, my friend's daddy went back.

189
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,320
He went 11 of that dollars of that money was theirs.

190
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,600
Some of that money was theirs that they brought with.

191
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,880
We just had a million dollars worth of change in our bathing suit pockets somehow.

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,000
But watching my friend Lenny's dad get in a contentious argument

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,800
with a teenage lifeguard at Sesame Place, I have not thought about that one in many years.

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
Negotiation. I agree.

195
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,080
That's only fair.

196
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,080
And that's a beautiful Philadelphia memory right there.

197
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
You know, it's very that mixed.

198
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:26,120
The relationship between Jersey and Philly could you could write volumes on volumes.

199
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Oh, yeah.

200
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Hi, Craig. Yeah.

201
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
Hey, I don't know anything about it.

202
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,280
I know. I know. Wisconsin, Chicago.

203
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,760
That's what I know. You know, I know.

204
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,360
There's like a dividing line between the states and even between North and South Jersey,

205
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,200
where like you can see the shops start calling sandwiches.

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,960
They stop calling them subs and start calling them hoagies,

207
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,880
whether they call it Taylor pork roll or Taylor ham.

208
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,760
That's a big difference.

209
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,520
Sprinkles or jimmies.

210
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,200
And yeah, North Jersey suburbs are all kind of affiliated with New York

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,480
because a lot of commuters go there.

212
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,440
South Jersey is more Philly.

213
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,000
But then in general, it's funny because I feel like in the past five to ten years,

214
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,040
this has actually changed.

215
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,040
And Philly's gotten very artsy and it always had an art scene, but very much so.

216
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,120
But there was always a thread growing up of like the city,

217
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,040
like New York City people think that they're better than you.

218
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,400
That's why we don't like them in Jersey.

219
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
But Philly people, you have to watch out because they're completely fucking insane.

220
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Like Philly people are out of their minds.

221
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,240
So there was also that of like.

222
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Like like New Yorkers are snooty, so we don't like them for that.

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,600
But then Philly people, they're almost like kind of like feral animals,

224
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,240
and you just don't know what they're ever going to do.

225
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,760
And that was kind of the and I think there's still some probably truth to that,

226
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,120
that being the at least the cliche.

227
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
Like, man, like a lot of my friends, I will say,

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,920
the craziest night of their life took place in Philly.

229
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,040
Like when the Jersey people go out to party, we're like, yeah, things just got

230
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,480
way too out of control in Philly.

231
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,880
That's not that's that's a pretty common thing, I think.

232
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,920
Yeah, like a real like wild card, maybe there wasn't even a definition

233
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,600
of what type of craziness you'd get up to.

234
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,640
I remember actually, and I'm not trying to like slip in an extra plug

235
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,480
when we we filmed at a theater in Philly for my special.

236
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,520
And we were driving to the venue and my buddy Dave,

237
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
who was doing camera that night, and he goes, whoa.

238
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,080
And I go, what? And he's in the back of the minivan.

239
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
He goes, we just passed a guy on a bike and he was wearing a Jason mask.

240
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
And it was like nowhere close to Halloween.

241
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,600
And he's like, he's just driving around on a bike in a Jason mask.

242
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,560
I was like, well, yeah, like we're in Philly, Dave, like we are like.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
It's like.

244
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,440
Like we feel like that's not I'm not saying that it's like happens all the time,

245
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,800
but like you should expect to see one completely

246
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,680
inexplicable thing on a trip to Philly like that's right.

247
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,680
So yeah, this is not out of bounds.

248
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,720
No. In his memoir, like David Lynch describes Philadelphia

249
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
as like the darkest place he's ever lived.

250
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,680
Like not surprised.

251
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,080
One of the biggest influences on his work.

252
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,880
And then he moved to L.A.

253
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,960
and immediately started making a razorhead.

254
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,480
And that's just what you know, you come out of Philly.

255
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,360
My brother went to LaSalle University

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
and he moved down there in 1995.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,920
And I remember I'd go to visit him and I was a sophomore in high school.

258
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,120
And it was like I remember sleeping over his house one night.

259
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,240
We went to a 40 store and I'd never seen it.

260
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,160
Philly, they just have stores just for beer.

261
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,960
Like, wow, this one is just 40s.

262
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,080
Beverage distributors.

263
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,800
Yeah. Pennsylvania liquor laws are kind of weird.

264
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
It's it's it's insane.

265
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,680
You can get beer at one place or you can get it at a takeout at a pizza place.

266
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,320
You can get a six pack and then liquor and wine.

267
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,400
You have to get at state stores.

268
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,120
It's very complicated.

269
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
We were at this 40 store and we paid.

270
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,080
And as we went to leave, this guy walked into the door

271
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,240
and he was wearing sweatpants and no shirt and he was carrying like a weed whacker.

272
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,240
And he said, OK, you guys got any change?

273
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,600
And we're like, yes, sir.

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
Of course we do. Like, what are you going to say?

275
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,280
Like, sure. Of course.

276
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,680
You watched us get our change and you're you're wielding a lawn

277
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
implement like a weapon. So, yeah, yeah, we have a change.

278
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
We have change.

279
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,720
Yeah, I know that Philly, I know that Philly fanatic.

280
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,160
But if you walk around Philly, are there like a bunch of those?

281
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,640
Is that like a like a type of animal that's just roving the streets?

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,960
Yes. Yes.

283
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,840
It's the hundreds on hundreds.

284
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
You know, we should we should talk about the actual park talk.

285
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
But I do have one more question.

286
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,040
Jason, Jason is a very I would say he does not into a lot of wild stuff as a kid.

287
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,120
But he does sometimes surprise us with mentions of like East Coast stuff.

288
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
And I was going to ask Chris, did you eat the meat Scrapple as a kid?

289
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,040
Scrapple is kind of the that areas Taylor Ham, which was mentioned.

290
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,560
OK, they're both these kind of like hideous mystery meats.

291
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,160
Like definitely, you know, like like pork products made out of like a bunch of like

292
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,400
lips and toenails and rights and stuff like that.

293
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,080
And yes, Scrapple, I think I always associate more with Pennsylvania.

294
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,320
Taylor Ham is similar kind of.

295
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,520
I call it Taylor Ham because I'm from North Jersey.

296
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,920
You will see I promise you, you will see tweets from people when this comes out,

297
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,800
going like, fuck you, it's pork roll because people get really mad.

298
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,920
It's either whatever you call it.

299
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,080
It's like like a very sort of looks like Canadian bacon, like a round pork product.

300
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,200
But it's just so gross.

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It's like dirty and you fry it up on a griddle.

302
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,000
And a lot of times you eat it on a sandwich with egg and cheese.

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,160
And it's so delicious.

304
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,240
I stopped eating meat a few years ago and I still am like,

305
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,000
I have one thing is going to get me to go back.

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,360
It's Taylor Ham. It's it's like every time you eat it,

307
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,640
you probably take 36 hours off the end of your life, but it tastes really good.

308
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,440
Please don't say that. I don't have a lot of time left if that's the case.

309
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,680
I've just eaten my weight five times over in Taylor Pork Roll.

310
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,360
I just it's so surprising because it's such a though I never knew anything about it

311
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,080
as a kid or even even like up until a year or two ago.

312
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,800
And then when Jason said it, it sounded like something a little rascals ate.

313
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,240
So well, on the board, some of the boardwalks, it's like you go to burger places

314
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,600
and you can get a cheeseburger or a cheesesteak hot dog

315
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,440
where you get a pork roll sandwich, just pork roll and cheese.

316
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,760
And you add ketchup or mustard or lettuce and mayo.

317
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,400
And my favorite place to get it burned down,

318
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,920
burned down like a few months ago.

319
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,800
And it was next to an amusement park like in an amusement park,

320
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,760
the arcade of an amusement park that was a been in big hangar

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
that had been moved from a World's Fair.

322
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,480
Do you want to do a parody song?

323
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,120
They blew up the Scrapple Man in Philly last night.

324
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,720
I like that. Yeah.

325
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
The boardwalk also legendary.

326
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,280
I mean, I I'm sure you guys have talked about the Jersey Shore boardwalks, right?

327
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,160
A little bit.

328
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Not yet. Not yet.

329
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,200
He's bringing me back because waiting for the opus

330
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
because there's also these there's a lot of boardwalks down there

331
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,960
that I'll have these big spinning wheels that's just like pay a dollar,

332
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,680
spin the wheel, win a prize.

333
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,120
And very often, one of the prizes is a two pound

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,480
log of Taylor Ham.

335
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Whoa. I can just imagine you're out.

336
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
You're out, you know, you're showing your girl a good night.

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,480
You get the cotton candy.

338
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
You go on some rides.

339
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
You play the game where you try to get the frog to the end of the lily pad.

340
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,600
And the next thing you know, you got to carry around a two pound

341
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
log of meat all day because you got over ambitious.

342
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,720
Some of these wheels are so fun.

343
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,680
You could literally win a carton of cigarettes.

344
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,240
You could win. Wow.

345
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,560
Like like any random bullshit, man.

346
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,720
The Jersey Shore is those boardwalks you guys would love.

347
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,000
You would love.

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,920
And we got to we got to go, it sounds like we got to do it.

349
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,360
Well, I want to get there and like do like in lieu of a live show,

350
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,000
just get people find this place where you win the ham and have Jason.

351
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,280
The audience members just pay Jason until he wins.

352
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,880
It's just like everyone collectively win Jason a ham. Yeah.

353
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah, that would be great. Jason's came for it.

354
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,120
I didn't play the wheel. That's North.

355
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
Again, that's that's the North.

356
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,720
That's Asbury Park and Seaside Heights.

357
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Wildwood a little.

358
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, I would say wild wild.

359
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,280
Wildwood and Seaside are regarded as the two sleaziest.

360
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Like there's rides and there's games and fights out on the boardwalk.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,800
And then quite pleasant is a little bit more family, but still elements of that.

362
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,600
And those are those are the ones I think of that have a lot of ride driven stuff.

363
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
Yeah, the bigger coasters and and there's something.

364
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,720
OK, and everything you just listed, it seems like there is some like

365
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,920
there's varying degrees of trashiness to a lot of these places.

366
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,720
And then when we were going back and forth on what are we going to talk about?

367
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,000
And we you know, the Six Flags Great Adventure came up.

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
There's also this place, Wild West City.

369
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
And we know, you know, you're a fan of Action Park.

370
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,480
Collectively, all of this is just like so many of these places are so

371
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,320
dangerous and accident plagued.

372
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,720
Like the quote incidents section on the Wikipedia of this place.

373
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
Goes on and on and on.

374
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,520
I will dive in, but I wanted to ask you real quick on the way

375
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,840
because you brought up this thing, Wild West City, which is I take is a

376
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,240
I mean, it's what the titles it's like a little miniature

377
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,440
Western town where there's little shows and demonstrations

378
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,000
like horse shows and whip shows and the like.

379
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,480
Yeah. And they they do like a shootout at the OK Corral show.

380
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,840
And it's I believe it was built in the 50s and really hasn't been updated.

381
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,720
It's kind of in some ways, it's actually kind of lovely

382
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,480
that it still exists and is hanging on because it's in Netcong, New Jersey.

383
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,120
It's like the middle of nowhere.

384
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,280
And they have a bar that serves the saloon serves real beard appearance.

385
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,080
And then the kids run around with these shows.

386
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,560
And then this was something I had thought was a legend.

387
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,520
And then recently found out it's real because I do a New Jersey podcast

388
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,960
with friends of mine and my one buddy was like, no, this is real.

389
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,800
And he found the news articles that two of the cowboys

390
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,760
at Wild West City had developed a hatred for each other.

391
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,240
And one of them put real bullets in his gun and killed him during one of the shows

392
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,080
and tried to play it off like a Brandon Lee accident.

393
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
Oh, my God. Oh, I thought it was blanks.

394
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,080
I don't know how that happened.

395
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,680
And then they found out, no, you just that was your that was your alibi

396
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
to kill him in plain sight.

397
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,640
And by plain sight, we mean during a show aimed at children and the whole.

398
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,720
And when I tell you that the whole place is.

399
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,760
Smaller than a city block, I'm not exaggerating like it's tiny, it's tiny.

400
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
Wow. Wow.

401
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,520
And you're going to you're going to pull off a murder.

402
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,760
You think you're going to successfully pull off a murder

403
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,600
with with a boy with a bunch of suspects willingly.

404
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,360
Like the whole point is for these suspects to the suspects paid to be here.

405
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,880
You're trying to be here. Yeah, it's really not a not a

406
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,880
not the toughest case to crack, I would imagine.

407
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,880
Yeah. So you put a bullet in your gun and you shot that man.

408
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,280
And they saw these. Everyone saw it.

409
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,320
Yes. There's an audience.

410
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,960
There's a paying audience. Yes.

411
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,800
These children have no reason to lie.

412
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
They saw what they saw.

413
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,000
It was it was like one of them was a bandito and the other one was Wyatt Earp.

414
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,200
I don't know which was which.

415
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
I don't know who shot first.

416
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,560
But these are and these are teenagers.

417
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,000
The day that a teenage Wyatt Earp shot a teen bandito.

418
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,760
What a day. That's so insane.

419
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,400
There's a lot of strange, a lot of really intense stuff where where I grew up.

420
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,520
Really intense. Yeah. Well, this is kind of that's what I'm getting at is like,

421
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,520
like I just try to dissect the the character of it all.

422
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,840
And how do these parks end up so particularly insane

423
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,240
and full of incidents and accidents?

424
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
What is it about the place?

425
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,280
Well, it's a really good question.

426
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,640
And I thought a lot about it.

427
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
And I think that

428
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,920
for whatever reason, maybe it's because it is between New York and Philly.

429
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,000
And maybe there's like

430
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
some insecurity, too, I'm sure.

431
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,160
But there's like this.

432
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,680
I think there's this real like priority on being tough in New Jersey.

433
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,560
Like you kind of have to be tough.

434
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,160
And that's a very valued thing.

435
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,000
So I kind of feel like it's sort of built.

436
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
For these sorts of places, because.

437
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,520
It's like not only is it like you should go on this roller coaster that's super high,

438
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,600
it's almost where we're from, like the more rickety, the better.

439
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,760
And the less safe it is, the the more you got to like demonstrate your balls by going on it.

440
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,560
So there's almost like a death wish where I grew up with.

441
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,320
I think it's the short way to put it.

442
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,200
But and there's like a sick pride in getting hurt.

443
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,720
And.

444
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,040
A really unhealthy obsession with.

445
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,560
You know.

446
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,480
Don't be a pussy to just like put it frankly, hopefully by the voice,

447
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,040
you can hear that I'm mocking that attitude, but especially in the 80s and 90s,

448
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,520
that was really, really omnipresent and not just in theme parks, like

449
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,520
being a music kid, he used to go to punk shows.

450
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,520
There were always fights like there were just always like there was just a lot of

451
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,560
it was there was just a lot of you always had your guard up.

452
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,480
You always felt like things were going to go wrong.

453
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,600
You kind of expected them to go wrong.

454
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,200
And for some reason, we found it very fun and funny when they did.

455
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,720
And it was almost like a point of pride to be at the center of a disaster.

456
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,040
So, yeah, Jersey is just a place that's very.

457
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,680
Kind of obsessed with toughness, I think, to its detriment,

458
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,920
for as much as I love New Jersey and obsess over it.

459
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,840
I hope my son growing up there doesn't feel this constant need to just sort of

460
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,400
prove his toughness, but that was always there.

461
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,160
So it's like the more potential that a thing could be a disaster.

462
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,200
It was sort of like that was like moths to the flame almost, you know,

463
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,840
in many areas of growing up.

464
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,160
The danger, anything was like dangerous, like thrived, at least at a certain time,

465
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,040
because obviously, like there's still stuff that's there that's dangerous,

466
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,400
but obviously, like theme parks now are like the disnification of so much of stuff,

467
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,680
or the corporatization of so many things have happened.

468
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,600
But I assume the others we were talking about, there's still places,

469
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,000
especially in Jersey, where you can feel it still.

470
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,480
You can feel the danger.

471
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,200
Yeah, I think. Yeah.

472
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,400
Jersey knows it's not New York. Jersey knows it's not Philly.

473
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,040
It's like we know that there's a lot of derision towards the state

474
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,160
and it creates this kind of internal pressure cooker.

475
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,160
It's also so densely, it's the most densely populated state.

476
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,320
So everybody's on top of each other all the time.

477
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,280
So it's like you're constantly

478
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,000
it, you constantly always feel like you're kind of being judged or looked at,

479
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
or, you know, like you don't want to go on a ride and scream

480
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,000
because you know that somebody's right there is going to make fun of you.

481
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,760
And it just creates this thing of,

482
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,240
like I said, this thing that's very hard to verbally explain, that's just,

483
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,280
oh, that's the thing where I might get my head lopped off.

484
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,800
Well, then I should just go do it because why? Fuck you.

485
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,120
That's why. That's kind of the attitude.

486
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
The whole. I.

487
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,880
I found this picture of a sign that's in in today's park.

488
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Six Flags Great Adventure.

489
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,120
I had I vaguely remember seeing this sign,

490
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,600
but it did it. It's surprising to me a little.

491
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,880
And it's the bluntest side.

492
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,160
It reads warning line cutters will be ejected from the park

493
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,520
with no refund.

494
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,720
Anyone who leaves the line for any reason must return at the end of the line.

495
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,360
And usually like that's polite or, you know, matters dictate that.

496
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,160
And people, you know, if they have a good excuse, people usually let people through.

497
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,840
But that's a really stern sign to put it like a family entertainment center.

498
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,400
A lot of exclamation points. Yeah. Yeah.

499
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,240
It's like pointing a finger at you. Yeah.

500
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,120
To be clear, probably this is at the one that's probably the most above board

501
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,920
option in New Jersey is Great Adventure.

502
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,480
And and one of the nicest six flags, too, because it's filled with like

503
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,840
it's got a lot of interesting stuff.

504
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,160
It's filled with a lot of tall trees.

505
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,760
There's a big lake.

506
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,760
There's a questionable safari park.

507
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,320
That's that's one of the main things to talk about, by the way, with great.

508
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,360
Oh, oh, please. Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,760
That's Safari Park.

510
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,000
I just remember we did it a couple of times as a kid and

511
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,000
you drive your own car through it.

512
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,920
And yes, you didn't just used to do that.

513
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,160
You can still do that.

514
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,960
Now, I think they've put up more fences because the slideshow I found from like

515
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,800
the 70s showed like giraffes just crossing the road,

516
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,240
big cats right next to the shoulder of the road, like lions and tigers.

517
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,720
And it's like the great adventure safari.

518
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,800
There were rumors about great adventure.

519
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,160
The big ones being the things everybody heard were the biggest one was

520
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,720
you have to wear a hairnet on free fall if you have long hair because a girl's

521
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,040
hair got tangled up and her scalp got ripped off.

522
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,120
Everyone in New Jersey heard that story.

523
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,400
I think there's versions of that around the country.

524
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
I think that's a very popular park urban legend.

525
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,520
I know that their haunted house did burn down and a bunch of kids died

526
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,840
and a bunch of people got really messed up on this ride.

527
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,600
Lightning loops, this roller coaster that went backwards loop.

528
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,160
So yeah, and that said a safety precedent for like

529
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,720
worldwide roller coasters had to upgrade like safety measures

530
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,160
because of that. Yeah, because of lightning loops.

531
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Wow. I didn't know that.

532
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,760
Well, they didn't want to incur the punishment that was leveled at Six Flags,

533
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,040
like whatever board or bureau regulating these things,

534
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,400
rules not in favor of Six Flags, and they were forced to pay one thousand dollars

535
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
like the ultimate price.

536
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,200
What was the way? What was the lightning loops thing?

537
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,960
What was the the accidents doing now?

538
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,080
I believe the safety harness.

539
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,280
Let's see. I have it here.

540
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,680
Lightning loops.

541
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,960
Teenage girl was thrown from the train because she was seated

542
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,200
on the wrong side of the shoulder restraint.

543
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,000
And so I think that means she's sitting in front of the restraint.

544
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,760
So not locked in at all.

545
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,200
So, yeah, that's the wrong side, I would say.

546
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,720
I guess traditionally where you sit.

547
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,920
That's that's how I interpret it.

548
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,920
But then there's other little things like, yeah, like Chris was saying,

549
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,200
with this fire park, we were told at the entrance of this fire park,

550
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,080
please retract your car's antenna or unscrew the antenna.

551
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,080
Otherwise, monkeys will rip it off and then they will wail on your car.

552
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,360
We got to talk about this, because I was saying all those legends

553
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,880
about what happened in the park.

554
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,120
You always heard those.

555
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,320
You talk to anybody who grew up around my era.

556
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,600
The the safari was where the true insanity happened.

557
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,280
I went through it so many times.

558
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,920
You're not wrong. Those animals were running free.

559
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,440
And Emu once attacked my car, once started slamming its face

560
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,680
into the window right next to my poor brother.

561
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,880
My poor brother always weird things happen to him.

562
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,240
And Emu started trying to smash the glass.

563
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,360
I saw elephants having sex there.

564
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,920
There was a really there was one of these crazy things where

565
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,880
and me and my friends have talked about it for some reason.

566
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,960
It was always church groups.

567
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,600
You'd see these church vans and they'd always be the ones rolling down

568
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,800
their windows, trying to like feed a giraffe cheese.

569
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,600
It's and then the next thing you know, there's like animals

570
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,200
charging the church van and then the Wranglers got to come out.

571
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,640
But the baboons were legendary.

572
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,040
You just mentioned the thing about the the antennas.

573
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,000
That was very true.

574
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,480
There were a few other things about it, because from what I remember,

575
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,000
the baboons, I think, were the last section of the safari.

576
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,680
And it was known that they were like not under control.

577
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,480
They had these pink butts.

578
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,960
I remember that.

579
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,440
And the two things you knew, the antenna thing we all heard

580
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,000
and the other thing that was so great

581
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,680
was, if you remember in the 90s, they're still around today,

582
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,200
but they're like real classic cars, those cars that have kind of like the,

583
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,160
you know, it'll be like an old man car with like that leather or pleather

584
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,760
top half, if you know what I mean.

585
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,160
Yeah, like antique cars, antique cars were like a go to at parks like this.

586
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
And you're like kids rides.

587
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,240
Now they will.

588
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,160
Now they'd be antiques.

589
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,360
But back then, you'd still see like a 1984 Chevy celebrity

590
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,240
or Monte Carlo or something.

591
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,440
And some of those cars from those era, they had these tops.

592
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,560
I'm sure there is a name for them, but they basically be material.

593
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,760
And there would be signs everywhere.

594
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,800
And before you ever showed up, you were told if you have one of these cars

595
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
that has like a fabric or material top.

596
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,200
Don't drive it through here.

597
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,720
These baboons will destroy it.

598
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,000
And it almost became part of the fun because you'd be in this line of cars

599
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,800
inching through and you'd be looking around, go to any of these assholes.

600
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,160
Did any of them do it?

601
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,800
And you'd see it happen.

602
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,640
These baboons would seize upon these cars.

603
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,720
And you just see a dozen baboons coming, screaming with joy, ripping it apart.

604
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,520
And I mean, you'd see I had baboons have sex on the hood of my dad's car.

605
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,520
They'd be jacking off.

606
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,440
They'd be having sex.

607
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,640
They'd be throwing feces like.

608
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,440
And I remember so distinctly that at the end of the baboon section,

609
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,480
there was a guy, it was like a fence that I assume must have been electrified.

610
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,280
And there was the opening for the cars to get out.

611
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,800
And there was a guy who would sit there with like a bunch of,

612
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,600
I think, probably like German shepherds, like attack dogs.

613
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,760
And he had like a taser.

614
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,760
And his whole job was that when the baboons try to like

615
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
flee through that car entrance, he has to like use these dogs

616
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,520
and this gun to get them out of there and get them off the top of your cars.

617
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,720
And the safari was lawless in the best way.

618
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,000
And I have a lot of really good memories about it.

619
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,480
But, yeah, those, it was just so on.

620
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,280
I tell you, anybody who was a kid when those cars were still on the road right now,

621
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,720
who who went there knows exactly what I'm talking about.

622
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,240
These baboons would rip these things to shreds.

623
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
They would rip them to shreds.

624
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,000
And it was the best because that's another thing.

625
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,880
Another thing about that Jersey attitude is like

626
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,280
sometimes bad things will happen to people.

627
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,760
And there's very, very little sympathy if they deserved it.

628
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,640
Like in Jersey, it's kind of like if you want to drive your dumb

629
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,720
fucking car with that fabric top through and a monkey rips it up, I will laugh.

630
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
I will not feel like I'm not going to feel bad for you at all.

631
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,880
Because it was the safari is one of the great underrated

632
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,080
chaos pits of New Jersey is the great adventure safari.

633
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,960
Hands down, that place is the best.

634
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
I've heard it's better now, but I hear that it's not

635
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,600
not totally. It's yeah, it's not like it still says, like, allow 1.5

636
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
to three hours to get through.

637
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,880
And that's it back.

638
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,000
It would back up a lot.

639
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,600
We'd just be sitting there and then you'd see a car a few ahead of you.

640
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,840
And it's like, do they have their windows down?

641
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,520
Some accrete, an animal is coming towards that car.

642
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,760
And you would you. Yeah, you would see people like put the windows up,

643
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
put the windows up.

644
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,160
Yeah, just some asshole needs to try to feed a rhino, a Ritz cracker.

645
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,320
And now all of us have to wait here 90 extra minutes for this thing

646
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,840
to stop trying to tip this car over onto its side.

647
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,160
It's just the best.

648
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
It's just the best.

649
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,640
And when you were a kid, Chris, because we three are notoriously for the podcast.

650
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,840
There's not in, you know, widespread America scared kids.

651
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,080
We were three kids where we the littlest thing would make us nervous.

652
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,640
Like when you were eight or nine, were you cheering at the baboon

653
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,160
jacking off on the car?

654
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,320
I was also a very scared kid.

655
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,000
I was constantly terrified.

656
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,040
I mean, I was raised in a generation where it was just satanic panic and

657
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,520
kidnappings and all this stuff.

658
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,320
So I was scared all the time, but I took a lot of sick joy.

659
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,680
And other people's pain, I guess you could say like similar to the

660
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,920
action park thing where, you know, you'd wait at the bottom.

661
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,080
You know, everybody was waiting by the Tarzan swing to cheer when people

662
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,360
got completely obliterated.

663
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,760
Same thing.

664
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I would say.

665
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,640
Pretty much, you know, the first time you went through the great

666
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
adventure safari, you were probably psyched to go look at the animals.

667
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,760
Every other time you went through it, I would say that it was probably

668
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,200
increasing percentage wise, how much you were just there to see dumb

669
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,920
idiots get their comeuppance.

670
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,320
That's true.

671
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,680
That's what the whole theme of it was, was like, you could maybe, you know,

672
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,680
you could see an emu and it might sprint right past your car.

673
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,320
Or if you want to throw a cheeto on the ground next to it, now you might see a,

674
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,480
an angry emu attack the passenger seat while your mother screams.

675
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,600
And like, there's, I gotta say, like, I know it maybe is a little sick, but

676
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,320
like, it's really funny to watch.

677
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,680
It's really funny to watch because it's not, there's a million signs.

678
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,360
That say, don't behave like an idiot.

679
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,160
And they, there's so many signs.

680
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,400
There's just so many things you shouldn't do.

681
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,760
And then you see somebody who's just ignoring all them to do those things.

682
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,080
And yeah, maybe now I'll get to see, now maybe I get to see a swarm of over

683
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,640
stimulated baboons ejaculating all over your windshield.

684
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,480
Like that's, that's awesome.

685
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,080
It's like instant karma.

686
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,280
There's some really something to love there.

687
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:18,880
Yeah.

688
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,080
They should have like just videotaped 40 years of this and made a clip show out of

689
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,360
it, like animals attack clip show.

690
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,040
Oh, I bet they could have.

691
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
There's gotta be a lot of footage smuggled out.

692
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,400
I also know it's in, it's in Jackson, New Jersey, and two of my best friends from

693
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,640
college are from Jackson.

694
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,480
And they told me that there's all these like off road trails in the woods and all

695
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,360
the kids who grew up in that area know that like you can drive your four wheeler

696
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,960
back there at night and just be alongside the fence.

697
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,840
So it's like, you could take a date and be like, you want to go see some fucking

698
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,920
live giraffes right now so kids know how to get back there.

699
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,960
That close during the pandemic, two kids, I think just drove in.

700
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,360
They just found a back way and were just rolling around in there.

701
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,840
Really?

702
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,760
Oh, that's awesome.

703
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,160
Like the only people who got in in that eight month lockdown period or whatever

704
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,600
long it was.

705
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,680
Oh, I love that.

706
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,840
I love there's other stories of like, Chris, I don't know if you ever wrote, we

707
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,400
talked about this on a previous show when we were talking about Batman based rides,

708
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,840
but there there was a kind of short lived roller coaster called Batman and Robin,

709
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,840
the chiller, which was famously technical difficulty prone because it used a

710
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,800
launching system that drew on the like it drawed so much power it was starting to

711
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,480
cause brown outs and it it opened for like a day or so and then they had to

712
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,240
shut it down for months and months and months to to rejigger this.

713
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,640
When Universal Studios Florida opened a coaster with a similar launch, they built

714
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,720
a power substation so they did not blow the grid for the city of Orlando.

715
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,480
In Jacksonville and Six Flags learned that the hard way.

716
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,680
So eventually this ride was shuttered because it was also very rough.

717
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:16,320
They kept trying to make it smoother and then they they took it apart and for a

718
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,720
long time pieces of it were just sitting in a field rotting and rusting like by

719
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,880
by the park and then they were supposed to sell it to a theme park in South

720
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,520
America and then the deal fell through and then I think it just it was just

721
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:39,080
scrapped. But like just just a rusting Batman like ten foot tall Batman insignia

722
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,360
in a farm.

723
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,960
I just had another memory come back because I don't love roller coasters.

724
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,880
I've never been a huge roller coaster fan and they have there's a roller

725
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,040
coaster they have called Rolling Thunder, which is like this kind of very

726
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,840
charming wooden roller coaster like not you know they have like the sleek metal

727
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,000
ones with all the loops and stuff.

728
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
This is just one of those ones you just go up real high and it's like the clack

729
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,440
clack clack clack clack clack like that thing.

730
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,320
And I would go on that one because it wasn't you know you didn't go upside down

731
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,960
and there's actually a video of me that I think is still on the Internet where I

732
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,120
went on it and my friend in the seat in front of me was filming my friend and I

733
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,680
and it stopped at the top and it froze which is kind of the nightmare for

734
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,600
anybody who doesn't like roller coasters.

735
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,080
And it then proceeded and there's a video of me because I lost my mind.

736
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,840
It started going and I was like no wait it's broken it's broken.

737
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,640
No it's not it.

738
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,960
And I had there's a video of me having an actual nervous breakdown on Rolling

739
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,440
Thunder.

740
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,640
Oh wow.

741
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,320
But that's one of those good ride like one of those old wooden ones where you're

742
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,680
like you get off and you feel like you were just in a boxing match taking body

743
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,400
blows you know because you're getting like tossed around side to side.

744
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,320
I always enjoyed Rolling Thunder.

745
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,360
Well Chris you got the last laugh because that that one closed in I believe 2013.

746
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,560
No that's yeah that was an old classic.

747
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,280
Still on board with it despite the like attack it into yours like no don't you

748
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,880
can't kill it.

749
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,880
That's again like it's the same action park thing right.

750
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,600
Like what am I going to tell you the stories about the rides where I went on and

751
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,680
it was fun and then I got off like.

752
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,640
No I want to tell you about the one where you were physically in pain at the end of

753
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,480
it and also it broke while I was on it like that's that's a fun story.

754
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,000
Drove you.

755
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,360
Yeah.

756
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,720
I have the stories about the fun stuff and then I got off.

757
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,640
Yes.

758
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,520
I'm the host.

759
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,600
What the show is a lot of the time.

760
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,240
Yeah.

761
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
It's fun to go on Space Mountain isn't it.

762
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,160
Yeah it is.

763
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Successful journey.

764
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,360
Yep we love it.

765
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,560
Six Flags I will say Six Flags still has you know of the big three of Universal

766
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,280
Disney Six Flags Six Flags does still have some of the spirit we're talking

767
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,080
about because you can there are a lot of people not paying any attention when

768
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,280
you're getting loaded on a ride at Six Flags like you can still there are antics

769
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,160
at Six Flags and like you know teen like a lot of teen employees that are like so

770
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,000
checked out and you could easily see where stuff like slips in the crack so

771
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
they're like I guess what I'm saying is you can still find it's like it's like

772
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,760
you know it's like Green Day they used to be an authentic punk band but they'll

773
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,600
still play the echo plex once in a while you know they still have elements where

774
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,960
they're actually trying to do the old the old spirit stuff.

775
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,080
And the equivalent of that is that under skilled underpaid employees.

776
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,480
Yeah.

777
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,440
Will sometimes not strap you into the thing.

778
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,920
Green Day playing a 500 seat place or is similar to like a teen just going yeah

779
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,360
are you ready okay I'm not going to check the restraint and then hit the

780
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,520
button for the ride to go.

781
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Now here's exactly the same.

782
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,560
You guys may know more about than I do but another thing that my my co-hosts on

783
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,720
my New Jersey podcast hit me to that I did not know which is apparently in both

784
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,520
the the boardwalk ride attractions of New Jersey Six Flags all the theme parks in

785
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,800
New Jersey apparently a lot of the people who work there are actually very

786
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,200
young Russian people because there's apparently some system set up where it's

787
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,680
pretty easy for Russian kids to get a work visa at New Jersey theme parks.

788
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,440
Wow.

789
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,920
I've been told that a lot of these workers who might not be paying the most

790
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,680
attention may actually be Russian people on theme park specific visas.

791
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,160
I thought I thought that might be some food for thought that would get your

792
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,280
guys gears turn in.

793
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,240
Sure.

794
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,720
Yeah that feels like we could do a two hour investigative episode about.

795
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,200
I have not heard that.

796
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,160
I don't know if you guys have.

797
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,640
I know a little about that.

798
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,320
I hadn't heard specifically Russian but at Ocean City where my family always went

799
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:01,640
there's two two parks Playland and Wonderland and yeah very young workers and

800
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,040
you hear a lot of like European or Eastern European accents and and there is

801
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,440
a thing.

802
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,200
Yeah there's a work exchange you know summer work exchange where they they

803
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,640
they like put them up in like you know big old either either rental houses or old

804
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,000
converted hotels and then they work you know make money all summer and then they

805
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,520
go back back home.

806
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,160
Yeah my friend Nick has also I believe been to the exact places you're

807
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:42,280
describing and he says that there are like shockingly hot young Russian workers

808
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,080
at all of these places male and female.

809
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,200
He's just like they're stunningly beautiful Russians that are the people

810
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,120
like strapping you into the haunted house that looks like it's about to break down

811
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,160
for good like very big dichotomy.

812
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,480
There's a six flags exclusively using like hot Russian models to operate the

813
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,960
in in Bugs Bunny outfit.

814
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,400
You can't even tell they're in.

815
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,280
I don't know.

816
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,880
I have a story about that too if you want it.

817
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:11,920
Sure.

818
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,360
These people in the in the in the Looney Tunes outfits I realize now as an adult

819
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,560
that those that's probably not the best gig you know being out there on a humid

820
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,400
August day.

821
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:30,200
Yeah that that's another thing I think adding to some of the the vibe at a lot

822
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,680
of New Jersey and Pennsylvania theme parks these places are only open like nine

823
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,800
months of the year because the fall and winter is come so quick and the summers

824
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,680
are so hot and humid like this Swamp Land it's converted Swamp Land so like

825
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,960
tensions can run high in long waits and so to be in a Daffy Duck outfit and it's

826
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,440
a hundred degrees with a hundred degree humidity like a hundred percent humidity.

827
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,280
It's not ideal and I wish I felt more empathy as a child but I didn't and my

828
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,120
brother and I found it very funny to torment the people in those costumes and

829
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:13,440
there was one year we were there for the the Pfizer family picnic and my brother

830
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,080
just kept relentlessly messing with the guy dressed as foghorn leg horn.

831
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,480
When we went to leave there's a big fountain that's sort of you know you walk

832
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,840
up the entrance and maybe 30 yards up or so there's a big fountain and as we were

833
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,000
leaving we were walking past back back past the fountain and my brother saw

834
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,920
foghorn leghorn he ran over to mess with him one more time and the guy dressed as

835
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,800
foghorn leghorn took my brother's hat off his head and threw it into the fountain.

836
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,960
I find I hold that memory very near and dear I'm just you know think that I'm

837
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,280
like you're a kid you're like let's mess with that's fuck with that guy.

838
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Then I'm an adult now I'm 40 I'm like that guy was probably like four years

839
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,680
older than us pissed like it's probably his last summer before he goes to

840
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,400
college.

841
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,560
She's like got a girlfriend she's like waiting for him to get off this dumb

842
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,000
shift but he's gonna be even later because he has to go take a shower

843
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
because he sweated off a third of his soaking wet.

844
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,120
He's so mad he's here he's already dressed in his foghorn leghorn for his

845
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,640
job.

846
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,120
None of the hot Russians want to hook up with him and his foghorn leghorn and he's

847
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,480
got this pimply face do we mess with him just takes his hat and throws it in

848
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:22,960
the fountain.

849
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,160
I hope he quit that night.

850
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,760
I hope that I hope that I hope the manager was like we have footage of you

851
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,400
throwing that hat he's like out of here dude.

852
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,320
Hope that was the end of that nonsense for him.

853
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,640
I would just like to say I found some something that reference that at one

854
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,280
point marketing for Six Flags Great Adventure referred to the park as the

855
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,960
greatest day of your life.

856
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
So keep that in mind.

857
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,520
My memory was of a radio jingle where they they really you know they were

858
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,440
stayed up all night burning the midnight oil to come up with Six Flags Great

859
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,400
Adventure.

860
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,600
We had fun and that was it.

861
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,400
That was it.

862
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,760
That blade elaborates nonstop.

863
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,600
You want to get it?

864
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:04,880
Nope.

865
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,640
Nonstop all summer.

866
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,320
I would hear that song on the radio.

867
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,520
Do you remember Splash Water Falls?

868
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,600
I don't remember Splash Water.

869
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,680
Was that a ride in the park?

870
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,040
It was.

871
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,760
So Great Adventure had two log flumes.

872
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,320
One was a pretty good traditional log flume.

873
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,840
You know it's the circle thing.

874
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,440
You walk you sit down it goes throughout a couple different drops and it was

875
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:26,760
good.

876
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,000
And there was another one called Splash Water Falls which all it was was it

877
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,440
went up it went over it went straight down and it was built in a way where the

878
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,640
weight of the actual log boat would just launch a massive wave and they built a

879
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,920
bridge that you could stand over and just get creamed by this wave.

880
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,680
And when you were talking about the heat and the humidity it brought back this

881
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,640
vivid memory to me that is so disgusting from an adult perspective which was there

882
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,360
were some days July August where you would go to Great Adventure and it was so

883
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,040
hot and muggy that people would start their day by going through the bridge at

884
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:13,640
Splash Water Falls to get deluged with this like filthy theme park water just to

885
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,160
kind of cool down.

886
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,640
So you'd start your day by going let's get soaking wet with theme park water.

887
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,800
And then work it off all day like well by noon I'll be level.

888
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,960
And then yeah if it gets sweaty again I guess I can go back and just get soaked

889
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,240
with impetigo again.

890
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:31,800
You know.

891
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,480
Yeah.

892
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,600
Just talking about this how like the realization that as an as an adult like

893
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,080
why did I ever think it was refreshing to get splashed by theme park.

894
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Why was this equivalent to a an actual shower.

895
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,760
It doesn't make any sense to me past the age of 15 or so.

896
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,240
Let alone in the era before aqua socks.

897
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,480
You just be wearing your sneakers and your socks we would do that.

898
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Let's walk around with socks.

899
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,480
Am I ignorant.

900
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,960
I don't know what's up with aqua socks because we've talked about a lot about a

901
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,360
wet sock preferences on log flumes.

902
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,400
Maybe this is the answer.

903
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,480
What's up with aqua socks.

904
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,400
Well aqua socks are like those water shoes that you'll get that have like the

905
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,560
rubber soles and the mesh and people wear them in the ocean so they don't cut

906
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,920
their feet on shells and stuff.

907
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,240
And action park had a really good scam where they sold aqua socks.

908
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,200
And then you couldn't wear them on half the rides.

909
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,560
So you still had to walk around on like hot blazing hot asphalt and then you'd

910
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,000
have to walk back up to get them because they made you take them off.

911
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,880
But yeah those were like I think they're pretty popular item in a water park

912
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,040
gift shop because it's like you can wear these and not have to walk around in

913
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,920
disgusting wet socks.

914
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,760
What you're saying is this is a very old thing and I have just learned about it

915
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,920
in 2021 and I'm talking to you like it's a new gadget.

916
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,200
Well they were they were hugely popular in the Jersey Shore when I was a kid.

917
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,720
And I remember there was one or two summers where my mom's like if you're going

918
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,440
in the ocean put them on.

919
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,920
I don't like my parents are just like you keep stepping on shells.

920
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,840
Just put the aqua socks on.

921
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,080
They are not the most pleasant thing to wear but I see them a lot when people go

922
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,960
to Hawaii and they hike they hike through a mountain to like a waterfall and you

923
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,600
don't want to like if you're going in in the stream or whatever you don't want to

924
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,640
have bare feet you know if it's sharp rocks and stuff.

925
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,520
It's like the Scrapple of footwear you know.

926
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,760
I'm not that familiar with them either and it must be more regional.

927
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,880
I feel like the best way to date them for you would be I remember them distinctly

928
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,080
coming out around the same time that slap bracelets were hot.

929
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,400
I would put them in the same era of time.

930
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:42,840
Yeah.

931
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,320
Yeah.

932
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,360
And similar designs potentially potentially some garish neon.

933
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:47,480
OK.

934
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,680
Yes yes you got it.

935
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,760
And slap a Taz t-shirt on top of that and you're just going to have a great day at

936
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,160
Six Flags great adventure and some some hyper colors.

937
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,560
You had some hyper colors in there.

938
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:58,960
Sure.

939
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,280
When you touch them maybe some cross colors like there's a whole no fear.

940
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,480
I feel like aqua socks crossed over into the fear generation.

941
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
This tells you exactly.

942
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,880
This is the important work trying to culturally date aqua socks.

943
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:12,800
Yeah.

944
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,440
It's honestly more from surreal clues.

945
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,440
I got it more of this one of the more substantial conversations we've had on

946
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,440
this show honestly.

947
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,000
OK.

948
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,360
Very informative.

949
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,320
The other.

950
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,560
Oh go ahead.

951
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,280
Well I was going to say the other log flume which I believe is still running is called

952
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,400
sawmill log flume and splash waterfalls was really wide.

953
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,840
Technically a shoot the shoot attraction and a lot of parks in their marketing in

954
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,120
their commercials would show the big splash down and show the bridge.

955
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,000
I think Doherty Park had the bridge too.

956
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,720
You could stand on and get as wet as if you're on the ride.

957
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:58,360
But sawmill log flume was a long like regular style log flume that it's I forget

958
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,000
what the area is called now.

959
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
I think it's called something adventures.

960
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,120
Adventure alley.

961
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,720
Did I see that phrase somewhere.

962
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,440
Front Frontier Frontier Adventures.

963
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,360
So this is like words.

964
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah.

965
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,600
For our interest like this is like a very fun area because in the middle of the

966
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,280
log flume there is a massive like surrounded almost by water.

967
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:32,800
There is a massive two story barbecue restaurant and then across from the log flume

968
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,480
there is a runaway train like which I always liked as a kid.

969
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,040
I loved I loved roller coasters runaway trains were a great entry because you're

970
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,280
like OK this will be a little fast and a little rickety but it will it's not going

971
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,160
to be too intense.

972
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:58,560
And then the runaway train goes around the building for the skyway and their skyway

973
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,400
was a double cable car skyway meaning there were two cars going in each direction

974
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:12,480
and it actually been transported from the 1964 World's Fair campus and then used in

975
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,960
Six Flags Great Adventure.

976
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,520
Wow.

977
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,760
So it was an old it was old like when do you know when it was transported.

978
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,000
It was all it seems like that's old.

979
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,960
Well yeah I don't know if it was just sitting in storage because he has Six Flags Great

980
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,320
Adventure open in 74 just as Great Adventure and then it was bought by taking over by Six

981
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,040
Flags in 77.

982
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,640
But yeah they replaced the cars at some point with cars from Six Flags Great America.

983
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,000
But yeah there is a historic plaque like you can see if you go to the the Frontier

984
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,400
Adventure I think the Skyway station there's one and there's two stations you can use it

985
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,360
practically it goes like three quarters of a mile and you can get off Frontier Adventures

986
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
or the lakefront.

987
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,240
Chris I bet you and your teen friends always made sure to go check out the plaque on your

988
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,760
visits.

989
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,640
I bring a date to you and look at the plaque.

990
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,200
You know probably the things we would talk about most though we're heading down to Great

991
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:09,760
Adventure.

992
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:17,520
Let's make sure we see some baboons eviscerating a car if we can cause someone in a plushy

993
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,480
outfit to have a nervous breakdown that would be fun.

994
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,800
But before we get to any of the high jinks guys just make sure we learn a little bit

995
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,640
about history.

996
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,600
Just make sure we're really soaking up some history.

997
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:35,200
We appreciate the kinetic energy of the Frontier Adventures area with trains and log flumes

998
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,000
and and cable car you know gondolas and cooking meats.

999
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,080
That I'll say to that log flume I think is probably my favorite ride in that whole park.

1000
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,840
And there's people who love roller coasters and obviously they got some badass roller

1001
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,320
coasters.

1002
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,960
But as someone who has always been scared of the old roller coasters that log flume is

1003
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,440
a legitimately great ride.

1004
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah it was always very solid.

1005
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:02,400
I am I've never been so I don't have the rights to say my favorite ride but I do have a

1006
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,720
favorite ride based on title alone and it is a Looney Tunes themed ride and the ride is

1007
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,760
called the Michigan Jay Frog Fun Flotilla.

1008
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,720
Four kids died four kids died on that.

1009
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,880
No no no.

1010
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,640
In memoriam of the Fun Flotilla 4.

1011
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,760
Say their names.

1012
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:33,440
Yeah the that I believe was part of another really great named thing or promotion there

1013
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:40,480
which is that they at the same time they added 25 new rides 25.

1014
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,520
Now a lot of these were kind of like little dopey kid sorts of rides.

1015
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,760
Jason I think you know what I'm talking about.

1016
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,320
That you know it's just like to get the count up and obviously it increases capacity if

1017
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,880
we had a bunch of rides and is impressive to say 25 new rides all at the same time.

1018
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:01,080
But this caused the ad campaign where they declared that this was not just 25 25 new

1019
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,680
rides showing up.

1020
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,920
This was a war on lines.

1021
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,400
That was their promotion for the summer of war on lines.

1022
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,960
The war on lines.

1023
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,160
Pick a side.

1024
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,040
Are you for the war on lines.

1025
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,400
Congress had to vote on part of the war on lines.

1026
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,800
So it's just so grand so grandiose and like yeah and like violent.

1027
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,360
We're in that Jersey spirit again.

1028
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,320
It's not just like hey oh there's a fun flotilla now we're declaring a war on lines.

1029
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,440
Yeah you could just go with fun flotilla but instead let's tie it into the war on drugs

1030
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,520
or war on terror.

1031
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,720
People know how we feel.

1032
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,600
The most fun things have that have been happening in the last few decades.

1033
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,040
Let's remind people of them.

1034
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,360
This is a place where you keep in mind the centerpiece ride for many years was called

1035
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,360
the great American scream machine.

1036
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:52,680
Yeah.

1037
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,560
Machine that's what gets New Jersey teens flocking through.

1038
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,520
Let's go on a machine that makes you scream.

1039
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,440
And the subject.

1040
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,880
I uttered in the same breath as Batman and Robin the chiller and Viper which was it came

1041
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,440
in 95 and again commercials nonstop for Viper.

1042
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,960
Viper and great American scream machine some of the roughest coasters I've ever ridden

1043
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,960
like immediately like out of the box.

1044
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,160
I feel like they were pretty rough.

1045
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:30,080
I do know my wife is a coaster enthusiast and she grew up in Westchester County so she's

1046
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,360
also been to great adventure a million times and she swears and I've heard a lot of her

1047
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:39,760
friends where that El Toro is one of the great roller coasters that she's been on anywhere

1048
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,680
which I think is an all wooden coaster that's a great adventure now and that one has a

1049
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,760
really good reputation.

1050
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,840
Again scared of coasters.

1051
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,760
I like a good spinny ride maybe a log flume but I've heard that El Toro is kind of a

1052
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,240
pretty basic coaster but that people really love it.

1053
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,440
Yeah I think that that one's been a long time favorite.

1054
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,440
I remember really liking it came in 2001.

1055
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:11,520
It's called Nitro and it's just very big but there's no loops but you have a lot of air

1056
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,440
time like you you spend a lot of the ride just hovering above your seat and it's very

1057
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,680
smooth too.

1058
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,880
And I just remember my dad and I riding and just like laughing because you just feel like

1059
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,040
you're going to fly out of it even though you are appropriately locked in God willing.

1060
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,480
Yeah right.

1061
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,160
There's this one currently in the works that seems like it'll it'll really join the pantheon.

1062
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,080
I think it's opening soon.

1063
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,320
Maybe they've even been previewing it a little bit called the Jersey Devil.

1064
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:49,160
We got a Jersey Devil coaster which is that it's the tallest longest and fastest single

1065
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,840
rail roller coaster in the country in the world.

1066
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,520
And I read that and like oh sure.

1067
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,320
And then I realized I don't know what that means.

1068
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,160
Single rail I can't even picture.

1069
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:05,080
You guys look this up like I don't it's a very odd like it looks like there's no like

1070
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,000
I don't know gears or track or anything.

1071
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,320
It's just a very thin track right.

1072
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,080
It's like a very little monorail style.

1073
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,720
Yeah it's confusing.

1074
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,200
I don't know how it works defies science to me but it looks very cool.

1075
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,400
And what a good name.

1076
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,680
Yeah I think we're supposed to open last year of course the pandemic delayed it but I

1077
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:28,040
believe June 13th of 2021 is supposed to be opening day.

1078
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,280
That is a Sunday I looked.

1079
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,760
So that's a weird day to open a ride.

1080
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,000
It's the Lord's Day yeah.

1081
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,360
Devil it's the devil.

1082
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,960
So they're open.

1083
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,280
It's kind of a themed thing.

1084
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,200
We hate God.

1085
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,320
This is the devil.

1086
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,560
I say the Lord's Day but this is all about the devil.

1087
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,920
So if you hate God and Jesus come ride the devil.

1088
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,560
That's right.

1089
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,600
Well it's the whole theme.

1090
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,560
That's how they've been actively advertising it and I think it's working day.

1091
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,280
Good goody.

1092
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,320
Or on Jesus.

1093
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,560
Come at Jersey Devil.

1094
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,440
And then that goody.

1095
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,200
What's her face laid in the woods and laid with the devil.

1096
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,600
That's we all know.

1097
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,480
The commercial ends with come spit in God's face.

1098
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,160
We'll shoot you so high in the sky.

1099
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,520
You slap God in the face.

1100
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,280
And you're waiting for you head back down to hell.

1101
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,440
Lease Mus's hair up.

1102
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,640
Pretend you're a monkey jerking off straight into heaven.

1103
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,680
They have a king to cause well right.

1104
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,200
Which that's one that I look at it and I go I legitimately don't understand how

1105
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,960
people find that fun that looks horrible to me.

1106
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,240
Yeah.

1107
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,080
If there's one that's similar.

1108
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:40,080
Yeah there's one similar at knots down over here and I've I'm getting we've all I

1109
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,880
think gotten a little braver as we've done this show because we're all kind of

1110
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,480
scaredy cats when it comes to coasters.

1111
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,680
Jason the least of us but like that one to me still seems like I don't know.

1112
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,400
I think I'll have like a mental break going on a thing like that.

1113
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,560
And it's just the fact that it's just kind of about shooting up going up coming

1114
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,960
back down like for me because I've had over the course of doing this podcast I

1115
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,680
got over my fear of launches.

1116
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:09,200
I was dubbed a no launch queen and now I'm sort of shaking that off a little bit.

1117
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,640
Maybe not.

1118
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,280
But like for me the launch is the thing to get past and then I can have some fun.

1119
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,840
But these rides where it is only the launch and then the most terrifying climb

1120
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,760
and terrifying drop and the whole thing is over in like 40 seconds.

1121
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,480
That's none of what I want in a ride experience.

1122
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,720
Yeah it's I think I will do the not Sperry farm version of it at a certain point.

1123
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,880
But I do I mean maybe the speed of it maybe it's truly one of those things it'll

1124
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,160
be over like you won't even it'll be like surgery like it's so quick you'll be out

1125
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,880
knocked out so quick it won't matter.

1126
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,880
You'll just bully your blur your visual blur and you'll be like oh listen to how

1127
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,280
we explain these things that are supposed to be fun.

1128
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:47,760
Yeah.

1129
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,640
Maybe surgery.

1130
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,720
You're saying that as a positive.

1131
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,360
You know that's a good very good point that that that it is a bizarre like we've

1132
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,160
I've now gotten into doing like the haunts and mazes and I was always afraid of

1133
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:08,520
doing that and those but I mean it takes it took like eight mazes for me not to

1134
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:14,040
just be like clenched like that like the pain the stress I was feeling initially

1135
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,440
had to go away like I had to get through it like it was a like a trial by fire.

1136
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:26,680
Yeah there there was it actually is a nice story there.

1137
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,360
They have an attraction called Houdini's Great Escape and it's it's we we learn

1138
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,480
this I think when we talked about on our European vacation episodes it's a mad

1139
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,920
house where it's not a haunted house it's not quite a fun house.

1140
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:45,320
So what it is is like it's it's like a con artist trying to bring back Houdini

1141
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:51,720
from the dead and and then Houdini does come back and says you're a fraud and

1142
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,360
then turns the room upside down like you're sitting in a room and all of the

1143
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,360
like you're sitting in like rows of chairs and then everything else in the

1144
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,440
room starts to go upside down that comes right side up and then it does it again

1145
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,720
and it starts doing it really fast and they closed it down for a couple of years

1146
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,600
and then people were like hey bring that back it's still there we see it like and

1147
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,080
it is it is back open again but I remember that being very cool because we

1148
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,880
didn't know what it was when we went in they're like oh well it's kind of a

1149
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,080
haunted house sort of thing like they didn't spoil it and it was super fun.

1150
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:35,360
Sorry it involved the trickster and a voice says you're a fraud and this is a

1151
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,960
bizarre somebody's like stealing Houdini's identity this is a really

1152
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,160
bizarre premise for a roller coaster.

1153
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,120
Well it's mostly you have to get his social security number and his mom's maiden name

1154
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,760
that's like most of how the attraction works you're just stealing his actual.

1155
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,960
Zooming by grab it grab the numbers.

1156
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,240
It's like a sit-down show it talks about all this actual historical stuff

1157
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:02,240
because Houdini famously debunked a lot of charlatans a lot of people who were

1158
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,640
like fake spiritual mediums and stuff.

1159
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,640
Because he gave his wife and a secret word and he said secret word die you go to all

1160
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,640
the people the you know empaths we're not empaths you know what I'm talking about.

1161
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,400
Yeah they can.

1162
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,320
The media.

1163
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,320
Spiritualist mediums thank you and if they don't know the word then obviously

1164
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,360
they're frauds and nobody knew the word.

1165
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,560
I just realized there's something and this might be a complete diversion that

1166
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,480
you guys should feel free to cut.

1167
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:37,720
I'm talking to people who will either enjoy what I'm saying or find me totally

1168
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,920
insane if I may.

1169
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,240
Okay go ahead please.

1170
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:40,680
There is.

1171
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,640
Let's swing.

1172
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:41,840
Yeah.

1173
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,880
So my parents spend a lot of the year now in Orlando.

1174
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,760
There's snowbirds.

1175
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,960
My mom really really loves Disney World and I have a two year old so they love

1176
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,080
bringing him so we go once a year.

1177
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,520
And when we go to Hollywood studios my wife has always been shocked because she

1178
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,920
will sometimes really have to ask me just come on this ride with me.

1179
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,240
She loves rides.

1180
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,360
It's often just us.

1181
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:04,880
Come on the ride.

1182
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,560
I want to go on the ride.

1183
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:10,080
So I've bit my tongue gone on some rides I don't like with her but she's never had

1184
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,840
to beg me to go on the Tower of Terror.

1185
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,240
I love the Tower of Terror.

1186
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,480
Really.

1187
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,280
I love it.

1188
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,680
And first of all it's right the thing Disney has that I'm sure you've talked

1189
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:25,280
about to death is like even like even like the people dressed as the bell hops

1190
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,880
in the beat like they'll roll their eyes back in their head and you're like oh

1191
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,640
they actually like they try to make it.

1192
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,600
They dress this up as something it's not like even Space Mountain.

1193
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,760
If it was in light you'd be like this is a pretty weak roller coaster.

1194
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,400
Right. But it's not.

1195
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,200
They dressed it up right.

1196
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,120
So I like all the pageantry of it.

1197
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,920
But my wife goes it's pretty much just like free fall from great adventures.

1198
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,160
Just a free version of that.

1199
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:53,760
They were and I said something to my wife where she actively told me I was

1200
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,680
insane and I don't know what you guys will think or if I'm going to just come

1201
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,560
off like an idiot I said to her oh that's fake.

1202
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,800
And she said what do you mean.

1203
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,320
I said I don't think I think the Tower of Terror is fake.

1204
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,040
I don't think you're actually dropping.

1205
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,160
And she said what are you talking about right now.

1206
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,080
And I said well it opens up and it shows you that you're up high but then it

1207
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,840
closes and you feel like it.

1208
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,880
I said I have always been under the assumption that Disney is using some sort

1209
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,840
of hydraulic thing to make me feel like I'm getting flung up and down.

1210
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,760
I don't think it's real.

1211
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,200
That's why I'm OK going on it.

1212
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,720
And she goes it's totally real.

1213
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,640
You are going up and down.

1214
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,600
That's what you're feeling.

1215
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,960
I said I think the Walt Disney Company has us all hoodwinked and that they're

1216
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,840
very creatively holding us in place and using some sort of hydraulic system to

1217
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,800
make us all think that we're in much more danger than we're in.

1218
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,920
And she said if you need to tell yourself to keep going on this ride with you

1219
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,600
that's fine. But it's also one of the craziest things you've ever said.

1220
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,560
You're half right though.

1221
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,520
You are half right.

1222
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,360
Well, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,480
Yeah, yeah. Because you're you're not really free falling.

1224
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
You're being pulled down.

1225
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,080
You're actually going faster essentially.

1226
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,800
Yeah, you're getting in a little you get loaded in a little box and then you are

1227
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,480
going far pretty far up and down.

1228
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,080
But you're not free falling.

1229
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,160
The little box just has like, you know, cables and it's moving you up and down

1230
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:27,840
essentially. See, in my mind, you're staying almost totally still the whole time.

1231
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,560
Not quite. That's like Star Tours.

1232
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,400
That's totally still.

1233
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,720
So it's not I wouldn't go that far.

1234
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,120
But I also won't call you crazy.

1235
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,360
I won't get on board with crazy.

1236
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,880
You're a little bit there, by the way, as a Star Wars nerd.

1237
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,160
That new version of Star Tours is a considerable improvement over the old one.

1238
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,080
Well, this is the whole.

1239
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,920
Well, we're not going to agree with you there.

1240
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,960
Oh, is this the whole thing?

1241
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,560
I miss the. Well, no, I just I love the the pilot, the Paul Rubin's voiced pilot

1242
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,600
so much. I feel the loss of him.

1243
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
They finally got rid of that weird old robot.

1244
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,160
Oh, no. Oh, man.

1245
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,640
Now, this is scandalous.

1246
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,520
Now, we're going to need to cut this.

1247
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,880
Brought him back to be the DJ in Galaxy's Edge.

1248
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,240
He would not be the DJ in the bar were he not beloved.

1249
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,800
They wouldn't entrust him to spin the coolest tunes in the galaxy.

1250
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,840
If he was just a hunk of junk.

1251
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,280
And I'm not. I'm just saying everybody has their role to play.

1252
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,600
But I was like a complete Star Wars obsessive as a kid.

1253
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,800
And when you go to Star Tours and you're so psyched and it's some robot

1254
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,280
you've never seen before, you're kind of like, OK, OK.

1255
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,160
It's an expansive world. I like that.

1256
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,400
But that new one where Darth Vader catches you and kind of flings you back.

1257
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1258
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,680
Yeah, that's where I think perspectives differ, because I went on Star Tours

1259
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,000
having never seen any of the movies

1260
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,080
and which ended up not coming for like almost a decade later.

1261
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,200
So I have a Star Tours centric view of the of the franchise.

1262
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,160
So to me, Rex is like more Skywalker is right.

1263
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,440
Yes, exactly.

1264
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,800
So you are really much more of a Star Tours guy than a Star Wars guy.

1265
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,040
Oh, yes. Yeah. Very much so to this day.

1266
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,840
I still watch him and get confused.

1267
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,480
Who's that and what's this and have I seen this one?

1268
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,640
But I know I've seen the ride and I've seen all these different versions

1269
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,400
and I've been the spy twice. Pretty cool.

1270
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,240
Are you are you just like subscribed to Disney Plus

1271
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,680
waiting for that Rex vehicle to finally hit the screen?

1272
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,760
Oh, for. Well, God, I mean, what I'd like to do is make the Rex vehicle.

1273
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,000
There's any interest in that, but it seems like there

1274
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,200
I don't know how they're feeling about comedy these days.

1275
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,920
There would have to be comedy.

1276
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,520
Actually, no, it's very serious.

1277
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,280
You know what? There's the issue.

1278
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,160
It's a drama about a robot trying to make it,

1279
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,880
trying to suppress his urges to be an artist. Yeah.

1280
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,720
That's what he ends up being.

1281
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,600
But he's Rex is back.

1282
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,760
Rex is back and he's got depression.

1283
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,560
I would set the DVR for that.

1284
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,440
This upon announced.

1285
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,080
I I think we should.

1286
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,960
My pitch would be it's like Flight of the Navigator with Rex in the ship.

1287
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,000
But then, Scott, you're the like you play like a boy like Martin

1288
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,040
Short does in Clifford.

1289
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,840
So you are like a little boy that Rex is like kind of

1290
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,760
driving around in his like Flight of the Navigator star speeder.

1291
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,080
Now, look, I'd like that for me.

1292
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,920
I did. It does seem like audiences are, I'll say,

1293
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,400
repulsed by adults playing young boys.

1294
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,960
So much less myself.

1295
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,480
It's now I'll do it.

1296
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,640
I will look all star in this if you get off the ground.

1297
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,200
Is the commercial potential is dwindling?

1298
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,840
I thought you were going to say I I would do it for me,

1299
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,800
but I think audiences would be so overjoyed

1300
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,880
and over exhilarated that they would all be passing out

1301
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,560
and suffering from medical issues at how good this show is going to be

1302
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,040
based on what we've come up with here today.

1303
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,120
I'd say so.

1304
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,040
They're like the rush to tweet.

1305
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,000
There's so much Twitter activity with, you know, with Winter Soldier

1306
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,400
and every Mandalorian and like people would dive for their phones

1307
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,800
and just their fingers would start convulsing and they drop to the floor.

1308
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,920
I would like to see a series that's just

1309
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,720
six hour long episodes,

1310
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:18,480
and each one is basically you doing my dinner with Rex

1311
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,320
in my dinner with Andre in a different theme park eatery.

1312
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,920
Oh, geez. We go around.

1313
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,760
I show him the other stuff.

1314
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,560
I take him out of the Star Wars universe and then and teach him

1315
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,800
and like to give him a corndog for the first time.

1316
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,600
Just an hour long conversation with Rex.

1317
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,720
Oh, it's like a different eatery each time for an hour.

1318
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,920
No real drama. No, no real narrative arc.

1319
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,920
Just real mundane at ease.

1320
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,240
Like so the sodas come in small, medium and large.

1321
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,320
Sometimes there's an extra large, not necessarily in the theme park

1322
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,120
environment, but a lot of places have refills.

1323
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,920
So they got you covered.

1324
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,960
It's like, oh, really?

1325
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,360
Anthony Bardane's Parts Unknown with Rex.

1326
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,200
Yeah, yeah.

1327
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,760
Parks unknown parks unknown.

1328
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,680
Oh, man.

1329
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,320
Well, look, as long as if I can get some help like moving them around,

1330
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,880
that'd be the main issue.

1331
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,120
It's just physical.

1332
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,480
The physical labor involved.

1333
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,520
But besides that, I'll fill the bowers.

1334
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,720
No problem.

1335
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,800
Speaking of Disney, can I mention I like I have not been to this park,

1336
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,240
but I like the ripoff attractions that this park has.

1337
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,400
Do tell I can't think of them offhand.

1338
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,120
Well, Six Flags, it's got enchanted teacups.

1339
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,960
Good word soup of theme park words.

1340
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:47,040
Yeah. And it has air jumbo, which is obviously the Dumbo Spinner Ride.

1341
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,960
And these were there before, I believe, Six Flags purchased them.

1342
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,400
But yeah, there's no mistaking what they are.

1343
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,240
And I just love I love bootleg anything.

1344
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,840
And did you have you guys seen a picture of this?

1345
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,760
I could pull it up real quick here.

1346
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,200
Well, yeah, that's in here.

1347
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,960
Air jumbo here.

1348
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,480
Yeah. Jumbo.

1349
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,520
Air jumbo.

1350
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,560
So I really like that.

1351
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,120
Close legally, lots of lawyers check that.

1352
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:24,240
Now, that's not to say that they are entirely, you know, ripoffs and

1353
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,080
generic properties, because with the Warner Brothers connection,

1354
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,640
there's obviously the Lunditons, but they've also involved some other

1355
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,720
Warner Brothers properties.

1356
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,680
Batman, as we've said,

1357
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,520
there was a lethal weapon show for a long time, and that got replaced by a show

1358
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,920
where I'm going to bring up the sign and show you what is,

1359
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,520
I think, one of the most unpleasant phrases I've ever seen.

1360
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,920
The great adventure show

1361
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,480
Quest for Camelot Nights presented by Tyson Chicken Chunks.

1362
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,720
And let me clarify, that's not chicken, that's chick

1363
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:06,520
apostrophe in implying that whatever this product is, is not necessarily chicken.

1364
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,640
What a combo of brand and who even knows what this was movie?

1365
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,360
This particular night was in by Taz and Chicken.

1366
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,240
They really wanted to make sure that one product, which was like

1367
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,080
it was going to be pushed because they didn't want just a general Tyson

1368
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,760
sponsorship, they were like very high on that product specifically.

1369
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,800
Like they need out of our chunks.

1370
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,280
Are you saying we shouldn't be proud of our job?

1371
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,080
Proud of our chunks and we want everyone a great adventure to see it.

1372
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,400
If you're a fan of like of two headed dragons, then you'll also

1373
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,440
enjoy the adventurous taste of these chunks.

1374
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,320
So odd. The other thing about that, let me share the screen again,

1375
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,120
because there was like so Jason, you talked about this lethal weapon

1376
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,160
boat show a while back on a stunt show episode we did.

1377
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,720
So there was that and there was like, you know, so there's there's boats

1378
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,320
where all the stunts happen from.

1379
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,880
And then they had to turn it into this medieval animated movie quest

1380
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,760
for Camelot. And they just like I'll show you a picture.

1381
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,640
They just took a boat and just put a bunch of like fake rocks.

1382
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,360
But that's even going too far to use that term that we like.

1383
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,880
It's just like rock flats everywhere, still in a boat shape.

1384
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:20,280
Very clearly one of the laziest makeover jobs I've ever seen.

1385
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,480
Sad little Stonehenge on top of. Yeah, that's a sad Stonehenge.

1386
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,840
Yes, like a spinal tap size stone.

1387
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,000
Yes. Yeah, they built it to the to the small proportions, not the big ones.

1388
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,920
Eleven inches. I yeah, God, really strange.

1389
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,080
So it doesn't I don't know that that was the biggest hit they ever had.

1390
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,960
Quest for Camelot. It's hopefully chicken chunks did OK.

1391
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,240
Since you're talking about licensed stuff and Mike, you know, they yeah,

1392
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,520
they may have, you know, had some generic rip offs of Disney stuff.

1393
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,520
But in the summer of 1994, they were going all in on a new attraction

1394
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,280
because as the commercial says, first there was Star Tours,

1395
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,720
then back to the future, the ride.

1396
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,520
Now there's the right stuff.

1397
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
Mach 1 adventure.

1398
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,440
You all remember the 1983 film The Right Stuff, right?

1399
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,320
About breaking the sound barrier. Chuck Yeager.

1400
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,480
Well, now it's a simulator ride, a simulator theater, in fact.

1401
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,440
Uh huh. And that's how they advertised it was that that is how they advertise

1402
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,280
the biggest, the biggest cockiest walking in the room swinging like

1403
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,560
fuck those rides.

1404
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,000
We've got the right stuff, folks.

1405
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,520
The mostly dramatic, like not exactly like you don't think of it

1406
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,560
as like the ultimate kids.

1407
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,560
Well, we remember kids kids when The Right Stuff came out,

1408
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,080
they were all on the front lawn playing the right stuff with each other.

1409
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,520
They all wanted to experience it.

1410
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,880
I want to be Sam Shepard.

1411
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,440
No, I'm going to be Sam Shepard.

1412
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,360
Yeah, they were all there doing it.

1413
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,520
And then finally Six Flags capitalized on that desire.

1414
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,480
It was pretty fun.

1415
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,600
I mean, it was just a theater.

1416
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,840
It's like a D box theater, essentially. Right.

1417
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:13,280
But we did. I did like I liked any anything movies, anything where it was like,

1418
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,720
this is a real movie and now it's a ride of it.

1419
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,240
I was like, good done.

1420
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,480
You know, we're an hour from home.

1421
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,080
You know, I know it's not going to be Disney World exactly,

1422
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,480
but I'm like, cool, they have a simulator ride now.

1423
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,040
Did you see the right Tutsi simulator?

1424
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,280
This is fine with me.

1425
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,040
This Tutsi's rushed journey to work at the soap opera station every day.

1426
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,400
Yeah. Now that I'm living Tutsi in a more interactive environment,

1427
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,000
I realize how intensely stalkerish it is.

1428
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,360
A man, a man deceiving a woman.

1429
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,320
It's just a man deceiving a woman.

1430
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,480
Oh, God. Get me off this ride.

1431
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,320
How can I follow this person around?

1432
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,720
That was a life lesson, right?

1433
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:56,680
It was like Mr.

1434
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,640
Toad where you would learn something by the end of it.

1435
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,080
What have we missed?

1436
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,480
Just to wind down here.

1437
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,400
What's the big...

1438
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,440
The guy who started the park is my is what I want to bring up.

1439
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,240
Oh, we haven't learned about this man.

1440
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:12,920
No, no, no.

1441
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,520
And and I believe his name is Warner Leroy.

1442
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,600
Scott, did you take a look at any of these photos?

1443
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:21,720
Anybody know?

1444
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,720
Not particularly. No.

1445
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,880
Show us Warner Leroy.

1446
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,160
All right. Here's Warner Leroy.

1447
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:29,080
I found an article where somebody referred to him as a Liberace type,

1448
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,120
which obviously we like that.

1449
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,440
Oh, cool. Like Elton John glasses.

1450
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,280
He's yeah, he obviously like dressed in fun ways.

1451
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,280
Jason, you have his interesting parentage.

1452
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,520
Yeah. Well, Warner Leroy,

1453
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,880
we should say first, he was an entrepreneur,

1454
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,240
I believe, was his company called Leroy's of Adventures.

1455
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,320
I think I saw that phrase in here somewhere. Yeah.

1456
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,040
And it it it had a lot of, you know, food and beverage establishments.

1457
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,480
Most noticeably, I thought it owned and operated both the Russian

1458
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,760
Tea Room and Tavern on the Green.

1459
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,320
Yeah. For a while, which are, you know, New Yorkers.

1460
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,720
You know, New York institutions.

1461
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:18,040
But Warner Leroy is the son of film director Mervyn Leroy, who

1462
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,800
when he worked for Warner Brothers, directed the classic films Little Caesar.

1463
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:28,480
I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and Gold Diggers of 1933,

1464
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,520
which is a big Busby Berkeley showstopper musical.

1465
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,480
And then he went to work for MGM, where he pitched them the idea that, hey,

1466
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,000
we should wake.

1467
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,560
We should make The Wizard of Oz a movie.

1468
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,600
Whoa. This guy's dad.

1469
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,240
Yeah, this guy's dad. Oh, my God.

1470
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,000
And it's it kind of came full circle, too, because a little known fact

1471
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,760
is that after the Wright Stuff Simulator ride struck out,

1472
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:57,320
they said, why don't we rebrand it as an I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang?

1473
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,600
The rush of becoming a fugitive running down the hill.

1474
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,040
Oh, my God. It was really it was really fucked up, it turns out.

1475
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,520
So they switched it back within weeks.

1476
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,480
People really jumped when they put chains around their legs.

1477
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,320
Oh, geez. It is really dark and racist and exposed to prison.

1478
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,680
Yeah. Complex.

1479
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,800
You can't you can't make a ride based on a movie that was pre-haze code.

1480
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,520
Are you crazy?

1481
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,600
This is well, this is this is some lineage.

1482
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,440
Yeah. Leroy. Wow.

1483
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,440
Leroy. Yeah.

1484
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,560
And I was trying to find there doesn't seem to be a good

1485
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,840
or like an easily accessible YouTube interview because I was like

1486
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,560
I was ready to be like, here's a new one of our favorite characters on the show.

1487
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,960
But I still I'm going to have to do some deeper digging to find

1488
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,920
some more Warner Leroy stuff is that I was not aware of him before this.

1489
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,200
Hmm.

1490
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,600
Hmm. I oh, you know what?

1491
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,960
I got I got one more thing.

1492
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:58,360
I forgot that with this with the the the haunts came up.

1493
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,000
And there is a thing that happens here that happens at

1494
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,560
as much as you guys know, at at Magic Mountain.

1495
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,960
We talked about it on the Fright Fest episode.

1496
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,200
And they do this tradition here to Chris.

1497
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,560
Are you aware of the 30 hour coffin challenge?

1498
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,320
Oh, I know about Fright Fest, but I don't know the 30 hour

1499
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,760
coffin challenge, though.

1500
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,880
Well, so so this is something I mean, Mike, you witnessed some of this in person.

1501
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,480
But they do it.

1502
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,800
They do it at the New Jersey one as well.

1503
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,840
That at least in this case,

1504
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,320
six contestants chosen from nearly six thousand applications

1505
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,800
are all all face off to spend 30 hours straight in a coffin.

1506
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,240
And on the grounds of the six flat.

1507
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,280
Just yes. Yeah, you stay.

1508
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,120
You stay in the Six Flags Park like you can kind of look up

1509
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,800
and wave at people because they can walk around the car,

1510
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,640
at least the way they had it set up out here was there was like six

1511
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,920
or eight coffins all just on the ground.

1512
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,520
And you could tour the coffins

1513
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,960
and see the people and they would maybe wave to you.

1514
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,200
And that would be the bizarreness.

1515
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,920
Now, I'm sure you've covered this on your prior discussions, but it's 30 hours.

1516
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,840
Where do you pee? Where do you poop?

1517
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,040
You are allowed to go to the bathroom.

1518
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,320
I believe that's it.

1519
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,040
And I don't know that they I don't think they check.

1520
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,760
I don't think they own breaks, too.

1521
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,360
I don't think they check to make sure you don't have like the bag of pee

1522
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,240
as if you were trying to fake a drug test or anything.

1523
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,040
I don't think they check that thoroughly, but I could be wrong.

1524
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,560
They dug a hole. It goes out of the coffin.

1525
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,640
What do you win if you stay all 30 hours?

1526
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,200
Well, the one out here, I don't know if I'm stepping on some of you,

1527
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,760
but say, Scott, I believe you win six hundred dollars.

1528
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,080
Is it six hundred sixty six? Was it? Yeah, yeah.

1529
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,360
Six hundred sixty six dollars. Thank you. Sorry.

1530
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,600
It was six hundred sixty six dollars.

1531
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,200
I don't know if that's worth it.

1532
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,320
I feel bad if you need the money, but I really wish Six Flags

1533
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,720
would give them, you know, something a little better.

1534
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,560
Yeah, that's not that much.

1535
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,560
Not a ton of money or just real like being in pain and like mental distress.

1536
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,520
It's not a life changing amount.

1537
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,880
I'm not even sure it's like a month changing amount.

1538
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,640
No, that's it's it's pretty it's pretty nothing.

1539
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,040
And I so but, you know, we talked about it a little on the previous episode,

1540
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,760
but I just ended up on a video where there's specific

1541
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,600
dictating of the rules of the great adventure one.

1542
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,000
And I was so charmed by this.

1543
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,360
And I'm just going to let this guy explain the rules.

1544
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,160
If anyone wants to stop and discuss any of the finer points, let me know.

1545
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,800
But here's here's a quick clip.

1546
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,440
The rules of the great adventure coffin challenge.

1547
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:47,280
They will face challenges with live bugs, unsavory food and green goo.

1548
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,000
They will be tormented by zombies, snakes, scums,

1549
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,120
yacht rock and baby shark.

1550
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,960
Just that, by the way, the switch from gross stuff to

1551
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,960
the threat is yacht rock.

1552
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,520
I think I'll be fine.

1553
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,240
Yeah, I think I will happily do the coffin challenge now.

1554
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,680
I have had baby shark stuck in my head, though, as the parent of a two year old,

1555
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,480
and it's not an enviable position.

1556
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,000
I will say, yeah, I'm really hoping I can write it out.

1557
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,480
By the time he like I got, you know, a couple more months

1558
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,760
before he really knows anything and maybe we just missed the whole thing.

1559
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,320
But is it just going to find him?

1560
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,560
Am I like it's in my school?

1561
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,840
It's inescapable. Yeah, yeah.

1562
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,040
I want to know more about the goo goo.

1563
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,400
Yeah. Did it just say green goo and what is that?

1564
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,720
It was very general about what type of goo it was.

1565
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,920
Is it dripped, dripped on you while you're sleeping?

1566
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,600
Is it something that you have to consume while you're there?

1567
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
The only thing you get to consume?

1568
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,480
Yeah, it's a good question.

1569
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,440
I really they should elaborate more.

1570
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,840
Yeah, yeah. But this is just, you know, they'll be 30 hours

1571
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,840
for everyone to learn all these announcements.

1572
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,880
I just now just pay attention to as this list wraps up

1573
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,760
the the the person who is saying all of the rules.

1574
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,480
Meals in the coffin, keep their body parts in the coffin at all times.

1575
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,840
And should they exit the coffin for any reason

1576
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,840
other than the allotted breaks and they will be disqualified.

1577
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,600
So we for the listener, we have just like like a ghoul

1578
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,080
in a long burgundy coat and a top hat.

1579
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,560
And like white face make up is kind of reading from a list

1580
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,880
with a microphone very, very long.

1581
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,600
It's well, it's that right there.

1582
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,000
He's in front of the old beat up hearse.

1583
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,800
He has this incredible outfit on the minutes.

1584
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,200
Like he's just holding the piece of paper and reading off of it.

1585
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,800
And it really it really undercuts the whole thing.

1586
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,680
Yeah, we put it on a tombstone like it's engraved.

1587
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,680
These are the rules that have existed for thousands of years.

1588
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,360
And we must obey them tonight.

1589
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,200
And some old dusty tome or something, right?

1590
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,280
Yeah, scroll. Yeah.

1591
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,840
Yeah. Roll a scroll of some kind or.

1592
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,240
Yeah, it would be.

1593
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,520
He looks like he's looking at like the schedule

1594
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,640
for whenever he was working at the park.

1595
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,200
It's also very bright.

1596
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,280
It's broad daylight.

1597
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,360
Like there are bucolic clouds and sky in the background behind it.

1598
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,280
It seems really nice.

1599
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,040
Yeah. And also what so what I was saying earlier about six flags, like

1600
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,880
you're not going to find a universal or Disney, a shot of inside the park

1601
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,360
where you can see the porta potties.

1602
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,280
You will not see porta potties on theme park grounds.

1603
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,520
Yeah, just a shitty tent.

1604
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,080
Yeah. And that's what's that's that.

1605
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,240
That is and I I'm not even saying that ironically,

1606
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:36,440
that is still the magic of six flags is that they like no one noticed

1607
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,000
that that looks like shit.

1608
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,360
That's what we love about it.

1609
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,800
It's so insane.

1610
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,160
The the the winner of the the winners are announced

1611
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,120
ultimately, at least this year, by Butch Patrick from the Munsters.

1612
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,640
Is that true? Yeah.

1613
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,640
Oh, he read the winner.

1614
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,840
Oh, I love it.

1615
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,360
Now, have you talked about entering?

1616
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,160
Let's be honest.

1617
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,000
Oh, that's a good.

1618
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,880
Could any of the three of us handle it?

1619
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:09,400
I have I would I first think for sure not me.

1620
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,600
Jason, perhaps the best sleeper.

1621
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,720
Jason is the most equipped because of his sleeping schedule to do well.

1622
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,880
He can sleep for 12 hours at a time.

1623
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,080
No problem.

1624
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,400
I didn't know that.

1625
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,160
I didn't know that there was a weird cage lid.

1626
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,400
I wasn't sure how open or closed it was, honestly, the way you talked about it.

1627
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,280
But I also didn't know they like bothered you.

1628
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,520
I was like, oh, you can.

1629
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,040
Can you just lie in there with an iPad like?

1630
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,680
No, I know there's a part where zombies walk up and get up.

1631
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,440
Wake up now.

1632
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,440
Oh, come on, man.

1633
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,440
The egg toss.

1634
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,640
Oh, no, really?

1635
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,680
I can raise.

1636
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,720
I don't care if it's for him.

1637
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,280
There's the rules from the piece of paper.

1638
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,320
But you can win six hundred dollars.

1639
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,520
Have you thought? I mean, yeah.

1640
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,480
The only thing that's out, that's like that.

1641
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,760
That's like the tax.

1642
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,360
Yeah, that's a little back.

1643
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,600
And, you know, that's a nice lunch at the best of the West.

1644
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,320
The famous, you know, Six Flags barbecue restaurants around a biolog.

1645
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,560
And now, yeah, maybe.

1646
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,680
But Mike, you love haunts.

1647
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,440
So are you the person to do it?

1648
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,640
Yeah, I love haunts now.

1649
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,560
That's true.

1650
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:23,920
But, you know, if I could negotiate sort of the terms of my of a victory

1651
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,080
with Six Flags with like I could get some sort of a lifetime

1652
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,000
annual pass or something or one of those food passes that they just give you three

1653
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:35,520
like three square meals for 80 dollars a year and I can get that for free.

1654
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,360
Like something.

1655
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,520
And those passes are real.

1656
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,680
Like there's these weird.

1657
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,960
It happens at Nats, too, where you can you can just tack on

1658
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,200
like an extra hundred dollars under your yearly pass and you can eat

1659
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,800
all your meals at the theme park for the whole year if you want.

1660
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,320
But if they could add something like that on, I don't know.

1661
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,960
I feel like if they could sweeten the pot somehow for me, not again.

1662
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,040
Yeah, I don't know. I'll think about it.

1663
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,040
I'll tell you on my end, I would consider entering this.

1664
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,720
Really? Yeah, because it looks.

1665
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,760
And I'll tell you exactly why.

1666
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,480
The image of that asshole.

1667
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,680
And I feel like you guys are and I'm potty mouth.

1668
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,000
But that guy, God bless him and not as a human, but like

1669
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,000
that's the foghorn leghorn of the of the Halloween season.

1670
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,840
He doesn't seem totally enthusiastic.

1671
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,720
He seems unfamiliar with the rules himself.

1672
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:29,320
That that feels to me like it's being run by someone who doesn't care all that much.

1673
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,960
Yeah. And those are usually situations that lend themselves to very good stories.

1674
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,640
Yeah. Do that at the age of 41.

1675
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:41,400
Yeah, that's I think I think maybe this year will be my year.

1676
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,040
I'd be willing to step up in the Jersey rendition if you guys want to do some

1677
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,960
follow up with this. We all do it.

1678
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,640
We all do. If we all do it.

1679
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:55,240
OK, if we all do it, I mean, I mean, I've either rule on this podcast is if everyone wants

1680
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,680
if two people want to do it, I mean, I won't.

1681
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,320
What if I get my cohost from my New Jersey is the World podcast?

1682
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,920
We all enter or elect a rep in Jersey.

1683
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,280
You guys do it out there and we have some sort of friendly standoff between the two

1684
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,520
clicks. Oh, East Coast, West Coast.

1685
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,640
Right. Right. Nobody's traveling even.

1686
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:18,000
Wow. We're just we just like, you know, like text like each other out.

1687
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:24,240
And we can we we can leave if you get like six hours in, if you like kind of go crazy,

1688
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:27,000
you can leave. You know, that's the challenge aspect of it.

1689
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,800
So it's not like we're really stuck there.

1690
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,960
Once the green goo hits your face, you can leave.

1691
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:36,560
If you're like if the green goo touches my face and on me like, fuck this, I'm a father

1692
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,880
and a husband. Yeah, you can.

1693
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,720
Like what am I getting out of this?

1694
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,880
Six hundred sixty six dollars in content for two podcasts.

1695
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,080
Not worth it. Yeah, I am.

1696
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,280
Yeah. If we could ensure if we could ensure, though, one of the cast members of the

1697
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,360
original Munster show will award us the victory.

1698
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:59,000
This is the problem getting like Butch Patrick to be by coastal to be able to give you

1699
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,800
that money.

1700
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:06,680
I would say that I am 100 percent down to enter either myself or someone from that

1701
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:10,200
podcast on the Jersey rendition if we can come up with a bit.

1702
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,040
I can say that we would be happy to do it because that's idiotic and ludicrous.

1703
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,880
All right. I will. If I have one of us has to do it, I'll do it.

1704
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,920
I will say that I will do it.

1705
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,120
I'm willing to do it. I'll let you do it.

1706
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,440
I will. I think all three of us.

1707
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:31,160
I think all three of us should do it, but I will do it if my two co-hosts will be

1708
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:35,600
cowards. No, I think I think you got it, brother.

1709
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,320
I think we'll just be dragging it down.

1710
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,200
I think that goo is your name.

1711
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,280
I'm ready. I'm ready to do it.

1712
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,040
I'm ready to get in that coffin and shit wherever they instruct me to.

1713
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:49,280
It feels like one of those things where at the end of the day, they're not allowed to

1714
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,520
hurt you. Right.

1715
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,600
Right. I don't think so.

1716
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,520
Some guy dressed as a zombie wants to let me not sleep.

1717
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,880
I have a two year old.

1718
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,480
I don't sleep anyway.

1719
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,960
That's true. Yeah.

1720
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,400
Years. Yes. You want to throw green goo on me?

1721
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,840
There's feces on my hands pretty much 24 hours a day

1722
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,080
all day. Very possibly green, depending on the diet.

1723
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,360
I have changed my son in the morning after he ate raisins.

1724
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,120
You think your green goo is going to scare me?

1725
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,480
I've seen substances more horrific than your green goo.

1726
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,120
There's nothing they can do.

1727
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,520
Baby shark, I've already been exposed to it.

1728
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,080
Yeah. You may sleep better, honestly, in the coffin challenge.

1729
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,040
Get away for a bit.

1730
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,200
But yes, I'm used to that.

1731
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,120
I am in. I'm ready. I'm ready to do it.

1732
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,360
I'll do it. Geez, geez.

1733
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,440
Well, you heard it. You heard it here first.

1734
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,640
This is all we'd look forward to.

1735
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,440
Any closing thoughts about this place?

1736
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,440
Did anything else you want to get off your chest about

1737
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,280
that great adventure and the great adventure spirit?

1738
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,760
I would just say that, first of all, if you've never been,

1739
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,240
there's a lot to love in both

1740
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,640
the fact that there's really good rides and it does have just a little bit

1741
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,840
of grittiness compared to a lot of corporate places.

1742
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,480
I would say absolutely 100 percent.

1743
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,360
If you want the full experience, the Safari Park is extremely underrated.

1744
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,440
It is a well-known source of ludicrous joy in New Jersey.

1745
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,040
And I would also just say that

1746
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,280
I was, you know, pretty major part of that Action Park documentary.

1747
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,080
And Action Park deservedly has its insane reputation.

1748
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,760
But I think that it has maybe swallowed up

1749
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,920
a lot of the insanity that was talked about with Great Adventure.

1750
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,240
And Action Park was certainly crazier significantly.

1751
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:43,120
But Great Adventure is a piece of New Jersey lore in its own right.

1752
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,680
A lot of stories, a lot of formative memories for a lot of people.

1753
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,400
So I do just want to, as a Jersey guy say,

1754
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:54,920
let's not let Action Park sort of suck up all the air in the room

1755
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,680
because there's a there's a lot of other places around here that are

1756
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,200
insane in their own right.

1757
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,880
And this is a big piece of that puzzle.

1758
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,640
Also, the Tower of Terror is fake.

1759
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,400
I like the Tower of Terror, truth or kind of movement here.

1760
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,880
Yeah, we've got started here.

1761
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,280
Pretty innocent truth or ism, all things told.

1762
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,760
So I think pretty harmless for sure. Yeah.

1763
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,440
Yeah. No storms happening over that one.

1764
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,280
Well, yeah. Well, thank you for shining a light.

1765
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,520
And for sharing the New Jersey theme,

1766
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,040
dangerous theme park insanity spotlight with Great Adventure.

1767
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,240
Chris Gathered, you survived podcast, The Ride,

1768
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,600
easier than a coffin challenge, I would say.

1769
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,120
And let's exit to the gift shop.

1770
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,880
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1771
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,600
Yeah, you know, I got a new special. It's called Half My Life.

1772
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,440
You can download it streaming a lot of places, iTunes, Amazon, Vimeo.

1773
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,000
And and I hope people like it. Check it out.

1774
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,240
It's a little tour documentary stand up special.

1775
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,600
And just because it came up enough times on this, I would say I do have a

1776
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,800
another podcast called New Jersey is the World

1777
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,680
that explores all different Jersey topics.

1778
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,680
And Episode One was actually about New Jersey amusement parks.

1779
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:05,120
So there might be some people who are interested in that.

1780
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,480
Absolutely. Cool. Cool. Well, thank you.

1781
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,440
Oh, wait a minute now. And Gatorland is some Gatorland presence,

1782
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,760
which is sort of in the theme park.

1783
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,880
I can't believe I forgot that. Yeah. Right. Right.

1784
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,600
Probably the major crux of my special revolves around a joke

1785
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,520
about Gatorland and then spoiler.

1786
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,600
It ends with me performing at Gatorland for the Alligators.

1787
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,240
So you want to talk about like and the whole theme of that joke is, hey,

1788
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,160
Disney World's the corporate option.

1789
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:37,840
Gatorland's right down the road and it has rejected all corporate feeling to it.

1790
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:44,720
So I do have a true love for Gatorland and and even just in Florida.

1791
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,280
I mean, like the Wiki Watchy Mermaid Park, not a theme park, but just an insane place.

1792
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,920
Insane roadside places. I love them to death.

1793
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,880
So, yeah, Gatorland majorly featured in a huge way in half my life.

1794
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,720
Geez. Cool. All right.

1795
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,200
So theme park content, very funny, special New Jersey podcast.

1796
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,400

01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:26,560
And I guess if everybody out there just make it a make it a quest for Camelot night

1803
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,280
worthy of worthy of your chicken.

1804
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,560
Yeah. Cut your chicken into chunks tonight in honor of that show.

1805
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1806
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,000
Mm hmm. It'll be a great one.

1807
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,560
Great quest and a great adventure.
