1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm rapping Jason and I'm here to say,

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,020
I love to rap in a second gateway.

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,540
You think this is cringe?

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,680
Wait and see.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,140
We're talking Mickey on rap to thee.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,100
Hi, I'm Jason Chardon.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,240
This is the Mickey on rap episode of Fuck SRI, the second gate.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,880
And that's what it is.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,100
That's what this is today.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,800
Mike Carlson, Scott Garand, both also here.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,020
Yeah, we are here too also.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,340
No, nevermind.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,040
Here we go.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,540
I'm feeling the flow.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,920
Those are low impact rhymes I know.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,340
That's good.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,720
That is good.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,620
Glad you liked it because that's the end.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,020
That was kind of where I was too.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,180
I was so excited earlier when I came up with a second line

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,080
and I was like, I feel like one of us is going to probably do,

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,040
this will inevitably get said, this kind of like,

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,500
I'm here to say.

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm here to say rap, which is where our parents,

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,420
at least my parents got stuck.

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,860
Rap is just this.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,260
So and so my name is, I feel like I remember my dad going,

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,980
my name is Joe and don't you know?

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,140
What did you hear that makes you think rap is this?

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,360
The best, my friend's dad, my friend's dad once,

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,900
I think he was having a huge argument about Jay-Z with him.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,860
Like I could do this.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,960
And like we were hoping, because we left to go like lunch

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,500
and we were hoping this didn't happen,

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,760
but we were hoping we would come back and there would be like a notebook

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,320
on the table that his dad, and we were like,

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,440
so like, please let your dad try to write a rap song.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,640
Please make good on this promise.

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,680
It's been very fun for me.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Like everybody who I liked, like Jay-Z or people I argued with my dad

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,700
about in high school or middle school, like watching them all become like

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,340
humanitarians, like people who do like a bunch of good.

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,880
And like there's really, you just like have no leg to stand on.

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,440
I feel like it's also, yeah.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,140
It's also like, at this point, hip hop has been around for a long time.

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,540
And it's like, you know, you, you remember when you were young

49
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,020
and people were like, this isn't music.

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,560
Do you remember like there, there's parodies of it back then.

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
There's people like parodying the, I think like Alan Sherman has like Beach Boy

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,960
parody songs, which are valid and it's fine to parody things.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,040
Oh, it's the, well, yeah.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,480
I mean, Eva's big on all this is the, the like,

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,480
what's the, it's pop goes the weasel with I hate the Beatles.

56
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,780
Or pop hates the Beatles, something in there.

57
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,680
Maybe it's a bad thing when you're my parents, because they love Alan Sherman.

58
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,060
Sure.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,520
They're fine with being Alan Sherman.

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,860
He's got some fun stuff.

61
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,620
I'm just saying if you look at the cyclical nature of, of entertainment

62
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,600
and pop culture, I mean, come on, look what's happening now.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,180
Yeah, I love, there is a recording from like a TV variety show of Tennessee

64
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,020
Ernie Ford, famous for singing the song 16 tons.

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,160
And he's like, well, music's a little different recently.

66
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,740
And I thought we'd get a little bit of swing on one of my hits.

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,240
And it's like a swinging like go-go cover of six.

68
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,000
He sings 16 tons while go-go dancers dance around him.

69
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,540
Wow.

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,480
Wow.

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,680
Tennessee Ernie Ford, of course, also on a very famous episode of I Love Lucy

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,320
that I love.

73
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,600
Well, tread lightly.

74
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Don't start saying stuff you need to take back.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,980
I'm going to have to take this back.

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,140
There's going to be a gripe.

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,600
I believe he's on one episode.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,600
Maybe he's on more than one.

79
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,280
I apologize.

80
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,920
I say I didn't know, so I'm not saying definitively, but Ricky's, Ricky's got to

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,300
get his band out of some trouble.

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,020
And they put, Lucy, I believe puts cheese in the instruments and clogs them up.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,260
And that's the end of the episode.

84
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,480
It's a big reveal at the end of the episode.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm sure I butchered that.

86
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,540
I apologize.

87
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,440
I will say this type of cheese.

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
I don't remember.

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
It's important to know that it's monster.

90
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,260
I'm so sorry.

91
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,300
Don't don't yell at me.

92
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,920
I will say my mom, all of a sudden, and I, whatever that came out in 1999, I think

93
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,400
is when the song came out.

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,720
Also, my mom was like, you know, this Nelly song hot in here.

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,320
Whoa.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,360
This is a good song.

97
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,740
Wow.

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,600
Wow.

99
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,340
That's a funny one for you.

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:40,880
Like mom.

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,920
She's like, but I guess she was like singing it.

102
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,100
They sort of self sensor in a way, a little bit of and a little bit of like, so maybe

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,920
that helps it along that it's not those aren't suggestive words.

104
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,580
Yeah, it wasn't tip drill.

105
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
It was not.

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't even want to get into that.

107
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,520
It's tip drill.

108
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,060
I don't think I know.

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,700
Oh, I don't want to.

110
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,680
We don't need to.

111
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,520
I think we could draw conclusions from those two words put together to a little Google

112
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,880
search.

113
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,640
The second gate.

114
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
But still, I don't know.

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,040
Well, there's going to be nothing.

116
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,820
There's going to be nothing too filthy today because we're talking about Mickey Mouse's

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,300
rap career in the mid nineties.

118
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,020
Disney put out an album called Mickey Unwrapped.

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,900
And this was a listener suggestion.

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,640
I feel like this came up on Twitter.

121
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,980
So, so thank you for it.

122
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,400
Maybe we'll see how we feel at the end.

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,060
But definitely worth talking about.

124
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,780
I was a little bit aware of it.

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,840
Aware of the cover, certainly.

126
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
That's what jumps out at me.

127
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,760
Which is maybe the most regrettable thing about it, I would say.

128
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,540
Maybe we should describe that or hopefully you're looking at it in the in our episode

129
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:57,940
art.

130
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:06,420
But Mickey in a backwards red cap, some jeans slung down.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,780
The curse of the nineties.

132
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,620
Before America's greatest enemy was international terrorism, we were plagued by the scourge

133
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,920
of saggy jeans.

134
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,720
He's in sunglasses.

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,100
The cover is kind of in front of a sort of brick-esque pattern.

136
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,180
The shoes, it's like a bit like a boots or something.

137
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,620
The cover is just one of the most regrettable things I think they've ever had to do.

138
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,900
This is shameful.

139
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,260
Yeah, well, because he's wearing the saggy jeans with his little red shorts.

140
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,820
And I know that was a look where people would wear it like, you know, basketball shorts

141
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,960
or jeans would just sag down if they were wearing boxers.

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,620
But it's confusing.

143
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,200
Here's a plus up real quick for this image.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,060
I don't think he should be wearing big pants.

145
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,700
I think he should be sagging his little Mickey shorts.

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,200
And he should have some sort of undergarment under it that he's showing off in that manner.

147
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,220
Because this makes it look like Mickey's wearing underwear always.

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,940
That's what the shorts are, is underwear and always has been.

149
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,760
Exactly.

150
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,880
So I think, and maybe there was a discussion with the graphic artist who did this,

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,140
that Mickey should be sagging his red shorts, his little red shorts.

152
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,660
That's a plus up.

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,320
If we were doing this again tomorrow, that's what I would say.

154
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,120
But would it not just seem like he's taking them off?

155
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,940
You know, because he's wearing jeans with a belt,

156
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,700
and the belt kind of cinches it so that it doesn't fall all the way down to the knees or below.

157
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,720
But you know, it would be weird if there was a belt on the red shorts.

158
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,740
We know there's no loops on his shorts.

159
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,520
So if it was just his famous little red shorts falling down,

160
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,760
wouldn't it seem like he was removing his pants?

161
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,600
Okay, I have another plus up to that.

162
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,440
Make his little red shorts a little bit more loose.

163
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,920
Make it the same design.

164
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
Make them a little bit bigger and have them sagging, as opposed to this,

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,320
which makes it look like he's just wearing two complete pairs of pants.

166
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,440
That's what's happening, which is maybe what they thought.

167
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
You know, you've got things like crisscross wearing backwards pants.

168
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,720
That's the kind of thing rappers do, right?

169
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,780
Wear two pants?

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,780
Sounds good to me.

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah, two pants.

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,060
Two pants.

173
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,860
Put Mickey in Tim's.

174
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,640
Done and done.

175
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,660
Michael, I mean, did this go across Michael Eisner's desk?

176
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,660
Did he have to approve all this art?

177
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
Did he have to approve the project?

178
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
I'd like to think he did.

179
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,500
And he's like, yeah, put him in two pants.

180
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,160
Two pants.

181
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,360
He has to be wearing two pants.

182
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,840
That's all I know about hip-hop and rap.

183
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,000
Maybe he must have been on his radar to some extent.

184
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,380
Take his shirt off.

185
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,960
Mickey's got to have no shirt.

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm sick of those overalls.

187
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,640
Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, he had to approve the outfit.

188
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,780
I'd like to think every dumb thing Disney did while he was a CEO

189
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,120
was something he had to actually read and approve, which I think is possible.

190
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,580
Maybe.

191
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,100
It seems kind of likely.

192
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,060
We'll ask him when we have him on.

193
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,020
We can't end the podcast until we have him.

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,860
So if it takes us 34 years.

195
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,260
He's born on my birthday, too.

196
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,000
That should be enough.

197
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,620
We just learned this the other day.

198
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,220
Just figured that out.

199
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,880
I know.

200
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,180
Thank you to the listener who pointed out.

201
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,720
Boy, Michael's, Carlson and Eisner share a birthday.

202
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,160
Crazy.

203
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,560
Man.

204
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
And I also presented it the way that he was born on my birthday.

205
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,480
It's yours now.

207
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,660
You're the new kid on the scene.

208
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,060
Do you feel more cosmically connected to him or do you feel like there is any sort of like astrological?

209
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,740
Oh, I've always now I know what I connect to about Michael Eisner.

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,280
Yeah, well, now that we share a sign, I feel like I know him better.

211
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:01,460
I feel like I know I know where he's maybe coming from, you know, because as Jane pointed out,

212
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,940
there's spicy.

213
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,200
Pisces are very sensitive.

214
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,140
Yes.

215
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,680
OK, so I kind of understand.

216
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,900
And I can imagine now, you know, sort of when he was getting a backlash at the later part of the 90s and he was in his mind,

217
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,700
he was trying to keep Disney afloat by cutting budgets on things.

218
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,820
He wasn't trying to deliver a bad California adventure to us.

219
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
But I feel bad now.

220
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,560
I feel like he was getting heat and he was like, I'm trying.

221
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm just trying to help.

222
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
I'm just doing my best.

223
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,040
And, you know, I have sympathy for him now.

224
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,740
Trying his best, like so many of the characters that thrived under his watch.

225
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Exactly.

226
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,600
And he had a watch that looked like him or Mickey.

227
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,200
Now, that's Mickey fashion that I can get behind.

228
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,320
Is Michael Eisner watch in that one thing?

229
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
I thought I was going to talk about, but I feel like we could just dive in.

230
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,360
I mean, we're so we're deep into the into Mickey's rap game now.

231
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,140
Do we do we establish this?

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,880
Ninety three.

233
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,560
Ninety three is the year on this.

234
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:06,720
So you're in a very particular strain of rap, obviously, you know, sort of West Coast G funk is happening, but we're not really going there.

235
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,500
It's kind of more in the zone of the pop rap of the time.

236
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,160
These I just started to correct you.

237
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm seeing 94.

238
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,240
September 94 is when this came out.

239
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,900
Who knows?

240
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:26,120
But it seems like any time a corporation does something that's trying to capitalize on something that's cool or popular, they're, you know, five to ten years behind.

241
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,060
That's just about often.

242
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,780
I mean, I guess they're actually a little bit.

243
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,800
It's not even five years maybe here, but they're a little behind on the actual trends.

244
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:43,140
You know, what's you know, to that end, I think that the out of date nature is maybe not what's annoying about this.

245
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,880
It almost isn't in that they are parodying or tributing songs that are like from the last two years.

246
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,140
I guess I will give that to Mickey unwrapped.

247
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,240
I feel like what is bad about it is how do I finish the sentence that it is bad?

248
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,820
It's bad because it's bad.

249
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,380
It's the the.

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,900
Or is it maybe it's not bad.

251
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,680
I don't know.

252
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,940
Do you guys have an overall from what you listen to?

253
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,760
Because we kind of divided and conquered here.

254
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,720
We each took four songs and then we're going to put all our thoughts together.

255
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:25,320
If it's if I'm putting on my irony, fun, find hat, it's not great.

256
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,380
Yeah, there's some corny bullshit in here for sure.

257
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, there's fun stuff.

258
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,460
There's.

259
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,300
But it's it's not like is anything better than another Chuckie Day?

260
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,720
The Chuck E.

261
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,180
Cheese parody.

262
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,360
I don't think so.

263
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,220
Not from what I know.

264
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,680
No, that's what's a legitimate song.

265
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,240
And they went in the direction, which maybe is key.

266
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,680
They were maybe afraid of doing that.

267
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,140
That was a dicier area at the time.

268
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,100
But yeah, now Mickey could do some G funk.

269
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,820
No problem.

270
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,540
Right.

271
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,960
So I one of my songs is just like a straight kind of like nice sounding

272
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,760
gospel song with no Disney characters.

273
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,700
And I'm like, what?

274
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,280
OK.

275
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,860
And then that if I'm just listening to it as a as a music fan, I go,

276
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,560
this sounds nice.

277
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,340
I like this.

278
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,520
There's a little bit of that.

279
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,540
So I don't know.

280
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,540
I think this maybe doesn't succeed in most directions.

281
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,080
If it's like, is it a hilarious thing to make fun of?

282
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,620
It is.

283
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,140
It is fun to make fun of it, but it is not.

284
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,960
It is not near like a McGruff level of, oh, my God, this was this was

285
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,180
obviously supposed to be like a weird type of tool to keep kids away from

286
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,400
drugs, but ended up being this like little masterpiece accidentally or on purpose.

287
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,140
This is like intended to be novelty.

288
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,840
You've got to view it as either a kid's album or a or a comedy album.

289
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm not sure quite works as that.

290
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,380
Yeah, it's not.

291
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,840
It's not so funny.

292
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,400
I wasn't doubling over laughing while I was listening to it either.

293
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,180
So, yeah, I feel like what's notable about it almost is just hearing these

294
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,440
these voice actors because it is definitely, you know, there's no off brand in here.

295
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,340
It's definitely Wayne Allwine and Russie, Russie Taylor.

296
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,040
It is like Bill Farmer.

297
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,860
It's the guys, right?

298
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,680
Yeah, it sounds like it.

299
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,480
But wait, wait, Jason, what are you?

300
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,520
Did you have something that contradicts this?

301
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,780
I got a track that sounds a little off.

302
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,620
Well, it's later in the album.

303
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,320
So are you saying Bill Farmer doesn't know how to drop bars, Jason?

304
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
No, no, I'm not talking quality.

305
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm talking like that hits my ear weird scenes or it's just the performance.

306
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,180
That's just rubbing me the wrong way.

307
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Could it be the Mickey from that one?

308
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,520
The den use the den Mickey.

309
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,560
It's not Mickey.

310
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,520
It's not a Mickey.

311
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,200
We'll see.

312
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,880
We'll get there.

313
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,500
We'll get it out when we get there.

314
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:54,820
Sure.

315
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah, I think for at least my my tracks, my hot tracks are seemingly the real people.

316
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,380
And I'm mainly just like amused by that they they had to do this and gave it their all.

317
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,920
But to with results, sometimes they're like, what?

318
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,340
Oh, these poor, these poor people,

319
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,180
these people like in their 50s and above, in most cases, probably already.

320
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,380
And now having to get funky.

321
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,560
Yes, it's I would love to see.

322
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,140
Yeah, I don't think this was a big hit also.

323
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,880
So I don't think there was like making of specials or anything or documentation of this.

324
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,860
This felt like I mean, I guess one of my point is I'd love to see this happening.

325
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,680
I'd love to see Bill Farmer in the boot.

326
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,660
Being taught how to rap because they do they don't get it wrong.

328
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,560
It's not as if I feel like they capably figured out the tempo of current rap.

329
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,960
And it is not yo, yo, I got the flow.

330
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,160
Right.

331
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,300
Sometimes.

332
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:02,720
Right.

333
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,540
Yeah.

334
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:03,900
Yeah.

335
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,140
So we'll see.

336
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,460
I don't know.

337
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,180
Do these people still have the skill like this?

338
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,980
So could Bill Farmer do an episode of off book and with a sort of rap song?

339
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,640
I don't know, but I'd like to see it.

340
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,440
I want to see if he still has it in him.

341
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,200
He might get a practice.

342
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,500
Keep the tools sharp.

343
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,960
Yeah.

344
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
Telling if he did or not.

345
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,580
Should I dive in to my first four?

346
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:35,060
We all kind of we split up the assignment so that nobody was too burdened with the entire runtime of Mickey unwrapped.

347
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,460
But I'm excited about my four.

348
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,640
I think some of the I think some of the singles literally the single is in the first four.

349
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,220
But where do we start?

350
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:54,040
Well, you kick it off with one that sounds familiar from title, but it doesn't really go where you think it might go.

351
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,940
And maybe I'll just have you play as much of it until we feel like talking.

352
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,900
And that is a song called Ice Ice Mickey.

353
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,240
Now sing it.

354
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,680
Ooh baby.

355
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,340
Ice Ice Mickey.

356
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,560
Get down.

357
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,240
Everybody.

358
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,040
Ice Ice Mickey.

359
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,060
Now get back up.

360
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,220
Sing it with us.

361
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,900
Ice Ice Mickey.

362
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,040
Oh oh oh.

363
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:29,540
With a mission, a fine musician, fun and dancing are the first requisition music in the key of peace and harmony.

364
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,620
The world altogether.

365
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,220
That's the way it has to be.

366
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,060
Yellow shoes on his.

367
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,960
There we go.

368
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,860
Get you off your seat.

369
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

370
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,560
Seat.

371
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,180
Whoa.

372
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,220
Minnie just said, get you off your seat.

373
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,800
That was the context that we use seed in.

374
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes.

375
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:46,840
Yeah.

376
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,140
Kind of pioneered here.

377
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,240
Wow.

378
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,240
Did you notice that the first time or did you just catch it here?

379
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,380
I maybe wasn't paying attention that hard.

380
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,020
How could that be possible?

381
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,200
To think about it.

382
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,460
I.

383
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,280
Go ahead.

384
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,900
I was just gonna keep playing it if there's more.

385
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,940
I'll tell you a point to jump ahead to, but yeah, that's some of the hijinks that go on.

386
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,580
Like they do seed some of the rapping to anonymous rappers.

387
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,480
They have some some ringers, I suppose.

388
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,880
But where the money really is is hearing the characters.

389
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,360
I was almost going to tell you to shut it off until many came in.

390
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:25,900
That's what you want.

391
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,060
You really want a full.

392
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,460
I would almost take just many rap.

393
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,620
I think that's always pretty good.

394
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,140
That's you want more of that.

395
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,700
Yeah.

396
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,520
Yeah.

397
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,920
The word there is.

398
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,540
There's a lot.

399
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,240
There's maybe there's a ton of many.

400
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,220
They really gave her the ball here.

401
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:58,240
Mickey in this song kind of factors in with these little sides that sort of deconstruct the kinds of things you would say in a rap song, especially in a hype manner.

402
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,560
And maybe could you take it to around one twenty three?

403
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,920
And there's some good examples of that.

404
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,260
Mickey.

405
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Now I'm looking to do the left thing.

406
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,580
Everybody ice ice.

407
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm so cool.

408
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,520
I make polar bear shit.

409
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,180
What?

410
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,340
Disney is coming at you.

411
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,880
That voice getting a little weird there.

412
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,360
Yeah.

413
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,140
I don't know.

414
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,720
I don't think he knows how to say.

415
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,780
Like, that's a tough ask of Mickey to like sell, hit him off at the past.

416
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,480
Homies and the purposefully mispronounced homies.

417
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,540
Yeah, it's it's yeah, maybe it's just yeah, there's only so many things you usually say is Mickey the voice of Mickey.

418
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,640
And now here he goes.

419
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,780
Obviously, ice ice Mickey is a parody of ice ice baby in name only.

420
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,020
It is not ice ice baby.

421
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,840
Which it would be a better beat to go with the ripped off under pressure.

422
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,000
I would love a video of Mickey explaining, you know, no, no, mine goes like this.

423
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,640
Like that would be really great.

424
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,400
It's a tick.

425
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,400
See, we put that in.

426
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,560
So totally different.

427
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,360
Totally.

428
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,740
It's not a queen or vanilla ice.

429
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
But I guess they wanted to avoid that.

430
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,240
So they went with this sort of generic ice ice Mickey.

431
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,660
You also wonder if they like approached so because there are some like some ringers and like name ringers.

432
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,720
There's celebrities threats.

433
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,740
Well, sort of questionably throughout this thing, but not vanilla ice.

434
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:51,840
You you think maybe you have to wonder if they threw it to more of these people because there's one a few tracks away from me that is a literal parody.

435
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,800
But the actual artist didn't get involved.

436
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,640
But then there are some real artists.

437
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,860
So did they try?

438
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,380
Did they try to build ice?

439
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,260
And did he have to say, guys, I'm not cool anymore.

440
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,660
Nobody likes me anymore.

441
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,840
It's 1994.

442
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,980
This seems like something though.

443
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,880
How could vanilla ice have turned down if he was offered it?

444
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,720
You know, like I don't know.

445
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,480
Already.

446
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,900
So he's down to clown with cartoon characters.

447
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,420
Right.

448
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,360
So it seems odd that he wouldn't.

449
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:26,600
I mean, is it a weird Al thing where, you know, famously weird Al had asked certain people to parody songs and they said, no, Prince never allowed him to parody a song of his.

450
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
All right.

451
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:38,620
I kind of think is it the guy there's the controversy gangsters, gangsters paradise where he he did it, but he didn't officially get word and he thought he had word.

452
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,080
So maybe it's a situation where Mickey reached out to vanilla ice and there was some confusion about it.

453
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,840
Maybe so.

454
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,820
Is it possible vanilla ice was just it?

455
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,320
When did shook night threaten him on a balcony?

456
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,840
Before this, I think.

457
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,120
Yeah.

458
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,060
Was he still just like, no, I'm not.

459
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,940
I don't want doing that one right now.

460
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,180
I don't like laying low, lay low.

461
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,380
Rob's laying low right now.

462
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,800
Or did shook night dangle Mickey Mouse over the bat?

463
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,040
Like you parody this.

464
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,960
You are a dead man.

465
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,140
I won't do any death row.

466
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,040
I won't parody.

467
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,480
Murder was the case.

468
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,440
I swear.

469
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,300
Oh, don't pull my hand.

470
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,720
My shorts off, please.

471
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,940
I'm going to need those for the cover.

472
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,360
That's that's kind of what I wanted to play of ice ice Mickey.

473
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm being a little sparing in mind.

474
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,660
Could we listen to full tracks potentially?

475
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,660
But when I hear Disney Posse, I'm like, I think I'm good on that one.

476
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,560
I think I get the gist of ice ice Mickey.

477
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,100
Here's I mean, this is going to be a common refrain.

478
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,460
I feel like the people involved were lazy doing this.

479
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,860
I feel like this is one of the laziest sounding cash grabs that I've heard.

480
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:51,860
Yeah.

481
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,580
Yeah.

482
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:58,760
Give me some more effort, at least like like give me some like take some time to write these things.

483
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm like, OK.

484
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:09,120
Well, I was going to say if just on the behind the scenes front, I did learn a little bit about some of the people involved in the in the record.

485
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,980
If this is a good time to talk about it.

486
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,780
Yeah.

487
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,760
The because they're people who are clearly capable of being not lazy, I think.

488
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,680
They all have like this legitimate roots, I feel like.

489
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,940
Some of these folks.

490
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,200
The album was mastered by Bruce Botnick, which is a name that sounded familiar to me.

491
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,860
And when I looked it up, he is the producer of Loves Forever Changes.

492
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,980
He produced the Doors, L.

493
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,160
A.

494
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,460
Woman.

495
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,460
He produced the MC5's Kick Out the Jams.

496
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,720
This is like a guy who did fundamental, cool, great, revolutionary music.

497
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,860
He engineered good vibrations.

498
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,340
He was part of Pet Sounds.

499
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,560
This is a luminary who then is just like, yeah, I'll get the bass higher on Ice Ice Mickey.

500
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,300
Why not?

501
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
How long will it take?

502
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,900
Can this be an afternoon?

503
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,620
If so, sure.

504
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,500
Well, he's an accomplice of Jim Morrison.

505
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:10,100
So already that suspect is one of the most annoying men of the 20th century.

506
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,120
Jim Morrison.

507
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,100
He would have been part of this album.

508
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,960
Oh, Jim Morrison lived.

509
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,860
Oh, man, he would have been.

510
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,940
I was such an insufferable.

511
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,140
He would have been like the worst Johnny Rotten.

512
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,820
Johnny Rotten's really cheese.

513
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,780
Oh, yeah, that's Morrison.

514
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,300
He would have been.

515
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,280
He would have been on that single with Clapton and what's his name?

516
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,980
Van Morrison.

517
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,340
More lockdowns.

518
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:34,940
Yeah.

519
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,620
Yeah.

520
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,960
Did you come across Bruce Botnick's theme car connection?

521
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:39,960
No.

522
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:48,070
So he has a very long list of credits on IMDB because he has worked on a lot of scores for movies.

523
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:58,100
It was like on the sound mix for like Larry Crown and Jack Reacher, which I just think it's funny to back to back to full name movies.

524
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,200
But for theme parks, he is credited on the sound mix for Soren.

525
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,080
Wow.

526
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:06,960
Wow.

527
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,500
That's cool.

528
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,500
That's a good one.

529
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,740
That's a powerful boy.

530
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,620
I'd love to hear that in the room as soon as possible.

531
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,180
Sure.

532
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,920
I would love to hear that chopped up as a sample and then have Bill Farmer rap over it.

533
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,020
That's the thing I would like to hear.

534
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,220
But like an aggressive, goofy, like run the jewels style rap would just be terrific.

535
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,220
Yeah.

536
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,780
Oh, sure.

537
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,720
Yeah.

538
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,340
Can I say one more person who is involved in this?

539
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,020
And I may be opening up a can of worms by bringing this up.

540
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,860
The album was produced by somebody named Robin Frederick.

541
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,600
That's a female Robin.

542
00:25:45,180 --> 00:26:05,460
And she was involved in her Wikipedia says that she was like in co wrote did work with Nick Drake and also John Martin, who's a similar just like, you know, I don't know a lot of his work, but like it seems like pretty lush, stirring English folk.

543
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:20,640
And she wrote songs with them and then became started doing children's albums where she did many years later where she did not only this, not only this Mickey Mouse rap album, but an album that have you guys ever come across this or did you weirdly have this as kids?

544
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,120
Something called Bugs and Friends Sing the Beatles.

545
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,900
I don't think so.

546
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,420
Then, sorry to take us into a different kids novelty.

547
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,140
We're crossing the moat from Mickey to Bugs.

548
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:44,060
And I didn't time this out, but let me see if I can grab just a good random sample of Bugs and Friends Sing the Beatles.

549
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
Stop and say hello.

550
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,860
The nasal Beatles.

551
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,040
It's the it's the Beatles see doesn't even feel like books to me.

552
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
No, it doesn't.

553
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,700
Yeah, it's a really grating very grating.

554
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,880
So they have Hello Goodbye I see up there.

555
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,980
Yeah, it's a there's one.

556
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,700
I think they am I making this up.

557
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:35,160
It's like one of the artier ones they do like day and day in a life entirely with Road Runner and Wiley Coyote sounds.

558
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,560
Wow.

559
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,260
I didn't listen to the whole thing.

560
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,080
That's what I believe I heard.

561
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,580
Can we cancel this one and do that?

562
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,340
No, it might be.

563
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Maybe we have to visit this one down the road.

564
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,020
I don't know.

565
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,040
Bugs and Friends Beatles.

566
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,660
It's deeply more apparently in the liner notes.

567
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,140
They're referred to as the fabloonies.

568
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,240
Come on.

569
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,080
That's lazier than any of the other.

570
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,660
This is a warm guy.

571
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,860
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shoot, shoot.

572
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,060
Happiness.

573
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,720
I won Langhorn.

574
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,160
Why don't we do it in the road?

575
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,980
I say I say why don't we do it in the road?

576
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,900
Let's go forth.

577
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,400
I feel like I really wouldn't go on with that for a while.

578
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,220
Well, she was just a little girl.

579
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,740
You know what I mean?

580
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,340
Oh, no.

581
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,880
Oh, Pepe.

582
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,040
No, no.

583
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,760
Michelle, my Bella.

584
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,680
No, cancel.

585
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,860
You are not in Space Jam 2, Pepe.

586
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,340
I was surprised twice on that reveal because when you said bugs,

587
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,620
it's called Bugs do the Beatles.

588
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,440
What is it?

589
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
Bugs and Friends Sing the Beatles.

590
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,200
I thought it was like Beatles and caterpillars like singing Beatles.

591
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,520
Like I thought it was like the sounds of insects.

592
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,520
I also thought that's what it was.

593
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,040
Oh, oh, I mean.

594
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,040
I didn't realize it was Bugs Bunny.

595
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,860
Bugs Bunny.

596
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,740
Okay, so you had a kind of a delayed reaction.

597
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,740
Once you saw the mop-topped Bugs.

598
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,460
The mop-topped.

599
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,540
I've seen that.

600
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,140
I don't know what, wait, Taz ends up in Penny Lane and Birthday, apparently.

601
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,340
Taz all over it.

602
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,720
Taz does not.

603
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,120
Taz can't have a very good voice, can he?

604
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,860
It looks like Jim Cummings does it in it.

605
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,320
I mean, they probably play it for laughs.

606
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,120
And I was wrong.

607
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,560
I mean, it's even a crazier one that is done entirely by Roadrunner,

608
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,320
the long and winding road.

609
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,500
What?

610
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,220
Maybe this is good.

611
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,280
Maybe I like it.

612
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,680
I get it from a thematic sense because he runs on a long and winding road.

613
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,860
Oh, yeah, yeah.

614
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,000
That's always where you meet him at the beginning for the genus classifications.

615
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,280
Wow.

616
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,280
Well, I guess that's.

617
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,060
Just shift over.

618
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,660
We just ignore the rest of Mickey.

619
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,100
How mad, like listeners, how mad would you be if we did that?

620
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,040
Right now?

621
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,640
How mad if we had been in that this episode?

622
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,440
I feel like a couple of people, maybe, but I don't think everybody I don't know.

623
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,640
Boy, we'll finish it out.

624
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,940
We'll keep our way.

625
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,780
We'll keep going.

626
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,100
We'll hang with Bugs and Friends later.

627
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,440
Yeah, I am, however, plowing through it.

628
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,200
Let me see.

629
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,120
Can you just go 10 seconds into the next track?

630
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,660
And just to get a taste, I don't got a lot to say here.

631
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,340
This is in that genre of the characters aren't really involved.

632
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,860
And it's in a song called Minnie Mouse in the House.

633
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,420
Okay.

634
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
Get into the chorus here, mainly.

635
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,700
We're talking, talking, talking about it.

636
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,780
I wish you'd hurry up.

637
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,120
It's no fun without her.

638
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,460
Have you heard, have you heard?

639
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,220
It's a song about waiting for Minnie to get here.

640
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,600
The waiting for Godot, the song.

641
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,800
Yeah, who is the one we're waiting for?

642
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,420
To soar through the door and score.

643
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,580
So we're waiting for her.

644
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,460
To recap, we're waiting for her.

645
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,820
They've been waiting for her for a minute.

646
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,080
Minnie Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Minnie Mouse is in the house.

647
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,060
Minnie Mouse.

648
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,020
Okay, that'll do it.

649
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,260
For efficient storytelling, write 15 pages.

650
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,280
Don't throw out the first 10.

651
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,220
Keep the first 10 and write an additional 10 before those first 10.

652
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,080
A lot of time before the character shows up.

653
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,600
That's a good storytelling.

654
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:35,920
Yeah.

655
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,220
I mean, there's a very like a very Shoop, Salt and Pepper vibe to that going on,

656
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,900
which I like that part of it.

657
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,560
I like that like tea kettle, that the sample of the tea boiling.

658
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,520
I feel like multiple songs did that.

659
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:56,360
There's an MMC kind of R&B song that does that that I genuinely like called Real Talk.

660
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
I wish we were listening to that.

661
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,080
The Real Talk is I think a sleeper hit, like it should have been a bigger hit at the time.

662
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,500
Well, that's still that has to come on the music and a future episode as well.

663
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,720
We've been kind of talking about that forever.

664
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah, MMC's music.

665
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,800
Mickey Mouse Club, for those of you who don't know.

666
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,480
When they got cool and shortened it to pure MMC.

667
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,620
Yeah, this is not the end of Fudinchella, which is also a music episode in the future.

668
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,000
And who Bruce Botnick, this guy also cut his teeth on a bunch of Annette albums.

669
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,860
Wow.

670
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,600
Yeah, produced him, ran the sessions.

671
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,480
And he described, he said like a typical day for him might be,

672
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
I'm in the studio all day.

673
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,880
It's Annette most of the day.

674
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,720
And then at night, I'm going to sneak Jim Morrison in here and we're going to cut door stuff.

675
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,900
So, wow.

676
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,860
Yeah, he'd like do little handoffs between Annette and the doors.

677
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,260
So in the morning or at night, he's recording like, yeah, LA Woman or whatever.

678
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:02,360
And then in the morning, he's recording Annette's Italianette, Italian themed album where she sings about pizza pie and stuff.

679
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,540
Full album with the premise, Italianette.

680
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,320
Italianette.

681
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,020
There's Dancinette, Italianette.

682
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,460
There's Beach Party Records.

683
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,020
Yeah, it's Hawaii.

684
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:18,260
There's Hawaiianette, which is a Hawaiian themed album that's in the lobby of the Polynesian and Disney World.

685
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,200
These are all, you must like it kind of on an action figure level and that you have like the different modes of the turtles and then the different modes of Annette.

686
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,860
Yeah, it's like, yeah, she has something like a fireproof Annette suit.

687
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,080
Like it's Annette, but she has like a fire suit.

688
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:40,960
Like a Batman figure who would have like an orange suit and then you'd go into Toys R Us and you'd be like, I've never seen Batman wear this suit, but I should buy it.

689
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,140
I should buy this toy because he's going to need to be protected if I'm playing and he has a fire happen.

690
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,920
Obviously, I was always worried about fire because my mom put that into my head.

691
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,000
Everything's flammable.

692
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,600
Yeah, spontaneous fire.

693
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,880
Really hard collectible to track down, mech suit Annette.

694
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:11,060
Okay, so I'm going to take it here to the let's get to the single and I remember this very strongly.

695
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,660
I remember that there was a music video.

696
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,140
They probably showed it on the Disney Channel.

697
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:20,760
There was like a separate kind of more live performance music video that was shown on the show Walt Disney World Inside Out.

698
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,440
And that is a song called Womp There It Went.

699
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,720
Now, this is one where the actual artists got involved.

700
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,500
Tag team actually got there.

701
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:41,480
Tag team continues to make ironic appearances and things purely for money as they currently are in a Geico ad that you see a lot.

702
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,260
What are they telling you to soup?

703
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,540
There it is, right?

704
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,040
Yeah, right, right.

705
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,920
I think.

706
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,320
But this they maintained the Womp.

707
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,600
It's still Womp.

708
00:34:52,600 --> 00:35:01,800
But they make it this new story that involves a party happening in which people are dancing and trying to bring cakes out.

709
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,780
But through various mishaps, they keep falling.

710
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,920
And that causes everyone to say Womp There It Went.

711
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,240
And that is the setup here for.

712
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,740
And this, I think this is the one I probably want to hear the most of.

713
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,300
I think you can tell why it's the single.

714
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,020
All right, here we go.

715
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,280
Party people!

716
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,420
Here's squeaky clean music with full effect.

717
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,020
Squeaky clean.

718
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,460
I don't care for that.

719
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,520
The first thing I did on my main duck, Donald.

720
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,460
We're kicking the flow and we're going to do it something like this.

721
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,120
Donald Duck, back again.

722
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,820
Turn up the music, let's begin.

723
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,820
Party on party people, let me hear some noise.

724
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,600
Party with Donald, Daisy and the boys.

725
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,600
There's a party over here, a party over there.

726
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,240
Tossing Donald up in the air.

727
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,400
And now trying to catch him, he falls down.

728
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,160
Womp There It Went hit ground.

729
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,440
Womp There It Went.

730
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,300
Womp There It Went.

731
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,300
Womp There It Went.

732
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,080
Womp There It Went.

733
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,780
Womp There It Went.

734
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,640
Womp There It Went.

735
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,540
Womp There It Went.

736
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,940
Let me hear ya.

737
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,840
Get dizzy.

738
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,200
Whoa, whoa.

739
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,340
Yeah, I like that better.

740
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,140
That's more, the artists are involved.

741
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,560
They get a payday out of it.

742
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,460
They at least get some money.

743
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,120
It's not just the Disney corporation profiting off of a cool new form of music.

744
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:23,980
Yeah.

745
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,560
In reading a little bit about Tag Team, I was especially happy that they got this Disney money.

746
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,820
Because Womp There It Is came from one of the guys in the group was the main DJ at Magic City, the Gentleman's Club in Atlanta.

747
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:46,020
Where I don't pretend to know everything about this, but I think a lot of music was broken there.

748
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:54,980
A lot of singles were debuted, and if you could make it at Magic City when the dancers are out, then it might go wide.

749
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,140
I think this was the first big Southern bass song in a way, the first mainstream-y Southern bass song.

750
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:11,680
Knowing that these guys were like Gentleman's Club DJs, and then before too long, they're hanging out with Mickey Mouse and that's great, making a Disney book.

751
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,200
Not only with that, but Womp There It Is featured very heavily in D2, The Mighty Ducks.

752
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,840
It's such an unlikely pairing.

753
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,580
In 92, they're DJs at a classy strip club, but a strip club, I think.

754
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,620
And then not too long after, important pieces of the Disney empire.

755
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,960
What a journey.

756
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,600
I loved, I remember we would jog around in gym class.

757
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,900
We would have to jog for 10 minutes or 5 minutes or whatever.

758
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,680
We would jog to Womp There It Is, and I was so excited when they would play it.

759
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
I was like, this is great.

760
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,600
I love this.

761
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,720
This version, not ideal for Donald, doesn't sound like a great birthday for him.

762
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,540
They're tossing him around.

763
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
Tossing and throwing him.

764
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,380
Yeah.

765
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,920
It's like when you're like, I don't want a whole thing for my birthday, and then someone does a whole thing.

766
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,120
And it's like, well, this is for you.

767
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
This is not for, I told you not to do this.

768
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:19,580
You come into my house, you come in my house, you bake a cake in my kitchen and then spill it on the floor, and then spill me on the floor in front of Tag Team.

769
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,700
Tag Team though got the game.

770
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,000
They knew that you always have to harass Donald, and that's what's funny about it.

771
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,100
They knew, they understood the game of Donald.

772
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,660
Tag Team infiltrate me again.

773
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:41,480
I think if you synthesize a monster from R3 Donald's, maybe you get one passable.

774
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,560
You just, you have to take like slim pickings from all of them.

775
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,160
Yeah.

776
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,660
If you want to skip ahead to, now as much as I like this, I think it's the most successful thing on the album.

777
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:01,040
If you go to around, let's say 110, this part's rough to me, I have to admit.

778
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,760
Okay.

779
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,040
Well, here we go.

780
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,040
Daisy is falling by now.

781
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,980
This is…

782
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,140
Down the duck.

783
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,000
She's got the…

784
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:52,580
So just to pause it for a second, that, I think I've said on the show before, if there's something that's extremely corny musically, I get embarrassment goosebumps really bad.

785
00:39:52,580 --> 00:40:04,460
All the hairs on my arms stand up and the, when the characters all say boom, do boom, shock, a locker together in mass, you could see these goosebumps from space.

786
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,260
There, it just real, a shiver goes through me.

787
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,640
It is the corniest thing I have ever heard.

788
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:21,380
It has a very like vibe of a wedding DJ, like holding a mic out to the audience and like the seniors in the front, like during like say, whoop, there it is, whatever.

789
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:29,840
Like now you guys, shock, a locker, shock, a locker, like, yeah, like clapping on the one and the three, trying to do what the DJ has said.

790
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,260
They sort of heard this song 25 years ago.

791
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,680
It's that vibe of like, oh God, they're, they're, they're participating.

792
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,780
That's the main thing.

793
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,560
Sure.

794
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,800
Whoop, there it went.

795
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,600
Whoop, there it went.

796
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,420
Whoop, there it went.

797
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,760
Whoop, there it went.

798
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,140
Whoop, there it went.

799
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,580
Hey!

800
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,680
Cool, the Tellio disco sample.

801
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,800
He's in there.

802
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,940
W-H-O-O-M-P, it was time to eat the birthday treat.

803
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,060
Everybody lined up for the 10 layer cake.

804
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,640
It took Daisy all day to bake.

805
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,840
Who will bring it in?

806
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,400
Goofy will, but he tripped on his feet and he took a spill.

807
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Out of his hands the whole cake flew.

808
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,400
Whoop, there it went.

809
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,300
Goofy too.

810
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Can you dig it?

811
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,580
We can dig it.

812
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,200
Can y'all dig it?

813
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,360
Ooh, that again.

814
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,280
We can dig it.

815
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,540
Can y'all dig it?

816
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,040
Can you dig it?

817
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,960
We can dig it.

818
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,240
Can y'all dig it?

819
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,420
Can you dig it?

820
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,860
Maybe we're almost to the announcement.

821
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,760
I might have made a mistake playing all this.

822
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,900
Squeaky clean music coming straight at ya.

823
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,680
That's me.

824
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,720
I can be a mouse for fame.

825
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,280
Turn it all over to my pals, tag team.

826
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,760
Turn it all over to my pals.

827
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,020
Bring it back y'all, bring it back.

828
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,140
Here we go.

829
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,460
What's, Mike, what's your problem with squeaky clean music?

830
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,420
Because it's trying to be like, don't worry, it's not the bad kind of rap.

831
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,920
It's definitely trying to be like, don't worry white people.

832
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,520
Everything's fine here.

833
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,660
Not gonna hear anything bad on this.

834
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,240
He keeps saying it.

835
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,080
There was like a note where like somebody was like very worried.

836
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,540
So like, well, we have Mickey announced that it's squeaky clean music.

837
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,220
Yeah, no, that's a description of actual murders on this.

838
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,060
Right.

839
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,260
So yeah, that's my objection.

840
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,240
Not that I'm, of course, I'm always against clean, clean entertainment.

841
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,040
No, that I'm just saying the context for this.

842
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
I don't care for music being squeaky clean.

843
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,100
You're fine with I imagine the Annette albums you would describe as squeaky clean.

844
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,260
Yes, except for the album Murder Annette.

845
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,980
Just all murder ballads.

846
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,380
So that's that's whoop there.

847
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:53,700
It went.

848
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:07,420
I also I in terms of these guys getting getting money, I like that they not only did this, then they hopped across town and they went to Paramount and they did a version of whoop.

849
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,300
There it is very cleverly reframed to be whoop.

850
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,240
Adam's family.

851
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,680
There it is.

852
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,280
Yes, yes, yes.

853
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,660
Change the song, just kind of inserted it.

854
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:18,860
Whoop.

855
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Adam's family.

856
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,120
There it is.

857
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,560
They kind of sample the theme.

858
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,020
That's how they customize it.

859
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,420
But I was revisiting this song.

860
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,860
It is a delight because I mean, I feel like there's such a generational bug at this point.

861
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,540
Adam's family values is just like a tent pole classic and rightfully so.

862
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,400
What a great movie.

863
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:51,520
And it's fun to listen to their version of it because they describe the story for a while and you know, which involves Joan Cusack as this nanny trying to take the Adam's fortune.

864
00:43:51,520 --> 00:44:02,100
And they I just really love the nitty gritty they get into with the plot where they say makes Fester fall for her thing gets wise and spreads the word.

865
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,840
The family comes to Fester's aid.

866
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,140
Dry line.

867
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,900
A conclusion is soon reached.

868
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,820
I haven't heard that one in a while.

869
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,140
Is it better than this?

870
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,580
I like it more because there's not cartoon characters bothering you.

871
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:24,240
Yeah.

872
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:24,580
Yuck.

873
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,440
I like Goofy and I like Tag Team evidently.

874
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,340
But the mix.

875
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,880
I guess the one poisons the other.

876
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,900
I'm not sure.

877
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,140
Adam's family.

878
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:36,980
It's pretty good.

879
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,480
And then, you know, you watch the video, you get to see Pugsley and Wednesday hanging out with Tag Team.

880
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,740
They made so many music videos in this era.

881
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,120
And then there's the Hammer song too.

882
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,300
Of course.

883
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:49,760
Yeah.

884
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,340
Yeah.

885
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,580
Another custom.

886
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:59,000
What franchise got two custom like Men in Black, obviously, what with your black suits coming and the original.

887
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,600
But that's the star of the movie.

888
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:10,720
How do you get two custom rap songs from artists who are relevant only in that month and then faded immediately, perhaps because of the Adam's family song?

889
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,680
It's possible.

890
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,160
Yes.

891
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,960
No, I can't think of another example of that.

892
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,460
But because you bring up like a very like kind of Keystone 90s comedy we watched.

893
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,840
So I married an axe murder the other night.

894
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,160
And you want to talk about a big musical choice.

895
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,620
That movie plays.

896
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,100
There she goes.

897
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,160
So many times like we just started laughing.

898
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,300
By the last time it came out, it's like, are they fucking with us?

899
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,140
Like, what is this cute like three or four times in one movie?

900
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,660
And it's always just Mike Myers driving around San Francisco.

901
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,980
There's some perplexing stuff in that movie.

902
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:58,320
You forget like it's got a little bit of sketch comedy logic, but otherwise is very grounded.

903
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,200
So then it just makes the weird choices seem that much weirder.

904
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,300
Because there's like really normie romcom stuff.

905
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,240
That is very like normal editing.

906
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,500
They don't make a joke of how many times they play it.

907
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,340
But then they'll do.

908
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,920
There is some like crazy absurd Austin Powers style comedy in it, but not fully.

909
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,140
Phil Hartman as the prison.

910
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,820
Like that Al Khajraj poor guy is very weird and funny.

911
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,620
Of course, Mike Myers playing his character's father too.

912
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,800
He essentially does like the fat bastard, the Shrek and the Dr.

913
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,800
Evil voice at different points throughout this movie.

914
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:43,720
I love when like a more absurd sensibility has to be as to like slide into the like comedy plot box.

915
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:50,720
Like you got to save grandma's house or like like a love interest that the movie itself doesn't care about.

916
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,840
Like dirty work is one of those.

917
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,800
Norm is not thinking remotely about like chemistry with this actress.

918
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,380
He doesn't care about the stove saving the grandpa's house or paying for his surgery.

919
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,540
Like he was just told they put a plot in there.

920
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,240
All right, whatever.

921
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,840
And then I'll do a bunch of jokes about whores.

922
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,560
Yes, that is absolutely what his main concern was.

923
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,460
That was her number one with that movie.

924
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,320
Anyway, the I'll end my run.

925
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,480
I mean, now I'm like, this is one maybe we have to hear a lot of.

926
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,940
And I don't there's not a lot of intro I can do.

927
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,420
I think we just have to play.

928
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,380
What a mouse.

929
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,660
All right, so we know what this is.

930
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,420
But yes, no salt and pepper.

931
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,620
Right.

932
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,200
So it's a parody without the actual artists.

933
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,720
Yes.

934
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,100
It's strange because Coming to America just came out and that is what a king in it with real salt and pepper.

935
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,700
We get all right.

936
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,980
A lot of chorus to get through.

937
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,420
Well, it's so compelling, though.

938
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,240
But here we go.

939
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,980
Because you never hear about him with another girl.

940
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,180
I don't sweat it.

941
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,340
He's always sympathetic.

942
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,160
I get it.

943
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,840
Get around it.

944
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,600
He's a number one mouse for me.

945
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,200
I know that no mouse is perfect.

946
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,300
I give props to those who deserve it.

947
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,440
And believe me now, he's worth it.

948
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,060
So here's to the because we've had a great path.

949
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,460
No mouse is worth it.

950
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,980
Could make me laugh.

951
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,640
I get a kick.

952
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,340
He's my Mickey.

953
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,160
So feelings, thoughts so far?

954
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,060
Okay.

955
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,360
No offense to what's her name.

956
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,920
Who did Mickey Minnie's voice?

957
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,600
Lucy Taylor, Russie Taylor.

958
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,340
I don't think I know the yeah, I don't know that she's really like spitting here.

959
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,340
I wouldn't say it's very quiet.

960
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,200
It's very timid.

961
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,280
Maybe not though, you know, it is.

962
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,540
But totally many was a little bit more like, you know, big bombastic.

963
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:18,400
You know, she was a little more out there versus this where it feels like this woman is like trying to like just hold on tight while she has to do this.

964
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:26,100
She's just like holding the holding the clipboard, holding the music stand in front of her while she's like white knuckling it, trying to go like I got a rap.

965
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,800
What is this?

966
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,880
I don't know how to.

967
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,960
And this woman like looks like she seems like the sweetest woman.

968
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,580
She looks like a, you know, a teacher librarian of yours.

969
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,820
Like, yeah, this woman having to do with salt and pepper.

970
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,040
It feels like they turn their head, their turn or volume way up because they're like, excuse me.

971
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,700
You're not.

972
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,080
You're just whispering this.

973
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,440
I'm not confident in what I'm doing.

974
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:55,160
But then if she goes too loud, is she like now is she like trying to sound like salt and pepper, which has its own problems.

975
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,880
It's essentially got it's a Kobayashi Maru, which is a Star Trek reference to the no win scenario here.

976
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,020
There's no winning for this poor woman having to do this.

977
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,100
It's a very sexy song.

978
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,600
So you got to be careful.

979
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,440
It's a very sexually charged song.

980
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,840
And there's one this is where OK, you're right that she's very quiet and muted.

981
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:22,480
But there's this one part and maybe just try to get past the chorus if you can, because I don't hear that chorus anymore.

982
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,660
But the next verse is this part where she's full on trying to do what they did.

983
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,220
And I commend her for it.

984
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,800
He isn't fast like Speedy doesn't have a deep voice.

985
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,260
But if I was that a reference to Speedy Gonzalez, she isn't fast like Speedy.

986
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,140
There's no space or a Disney.

987
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,900
It's weird.

988
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,660
I know of it's weird.

989
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:52,980
They would acknowledge the other set of characters and almost like a diss a little.

990
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,500
Someone have written this not knowing that Speedy wasn't a Disney character.

991
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,500
Oh, that's very possible.

992
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,220
I feel like whoever was shitting this out was just like fast like Speedy, right?

993
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,980
Speedy's in the Disney.

994
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,980
He's a Disney character.

995
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:13,000
The way we watched Adam West in a thing improvising about like my buddies, Superman and Spider-Man.

996
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:13,980
Spidey, baby.

997
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:20,340
I love that he doesn't know that's a different like that's so much better.

998
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,380
I feel like than an actor knowing every little bit about the mythology.

999
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,280
I'm like, oh, yeah, I yes, I I some people get, I think, upset when actors are like,

1000
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,820
I don't know, Scarlett Johansson's on like a talk show and she's like, I don't know.

1001
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,520
I just show up.

1002
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,060
I don't know what movie it is.

1003
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,980
I just I did two weeks.

1004
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,780
I don't know.

1005
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,580
Like some people, I think, get mad about that.

1006
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,400
I don't give a shit.

1007
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,120
It's really funny to me.

1008
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,460
Better.

1009
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,000
When it's cool.

1010
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,300
Didn't know she was in a movie.

1011
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,940
A couple of weeks ago, they were like trying to remind her like you were in that movie.

1012
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,060
You're in Spider-Man.

1013
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,960
I was.

1014
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,020
Remember we were at the end.

1015
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,080
Billy D.

1016
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,080
Not knowing what the hell Donald Glover is talking about about playing Lando.

1017
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,320
That's the funniest story.

1018
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,260
I love that.

1019
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,500
They had a meeting about like, how do I play Lando?

1020
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,320
And right.

1021
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,320
I was asking a lot of questions and he's like, I don't know.

1022
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,240
Just be charming.

1023
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,620
Yeah, right.

1024
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,120
It's as much as Billy D.

1025
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,920
No, it's about it's great.

1026
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,660
It's great.

1027
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,980
All right.

1028
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,220
Back to back to Minnie Mouse.

1029
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:17,860
Okay.

1030
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,740
He knows just what to do.

1031
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,260
I don't have to say please.

1032
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,140
In my life.

1033
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1034
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,140
He knows which is what to do.

1035
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,760
I don't have to say please.

1036
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,060
What is she talking about?

1037
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,640
Nice.

1038
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:39,420
I said on the Mickey's house episode that Mickey and Minnie's love is, I believe, sexual in some way.

1039
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,120
Hey, you didn't just say that kind of dry stating a fact.

1040
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:43,700
Yes.

1041
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,680
I did say that.

1042
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,680
I remember I saw some people point that out that I said that.

1043
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,000
Minnie and Mickey's love is sexual in a way.

1044
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,500
It's in a court document.

1045
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,160
It'll be in a future court document.

1046
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,920
But this is what is she talking?

1047
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,680
She didn't.

1048
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,680
This line about baking cookies didn't precede this, right?

1049
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,520
I didn't miss something.

1050
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,580
Not sure.

1051
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,720
Let me go back.

1052
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,700
I just want to make sure.

1053
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,340
I mean, some of these lines are probably just from the real one.

1054
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,680
He doesn't have a deep voice, but if I had to pick, he'd be my choice.

1055
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,100
He knows just what to do.

1056
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,660
I don't have to say please.

1057
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,460
In my life.

1058
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,260
He's number one.

1059
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,340
The really big cheese.

1060
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:18,700
I go.

1061
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,940
Yeah, no way.

1062
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,420
As far as I'm concerned, she's talking.

1063
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,220
First of all, she's talking about how fast he is with his, I guess, his sexual prowess

1064
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:25,780
earlier.

1065
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,960
He's not fast like speedy.

1066
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,180
You think that's what it is?

1067
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,280
I view that is that he is not as fast at running.

1068
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,840
You think it's literally just running?

1069
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,100
That's what I think.

1070
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,680
She's saying.

1071
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,840
You're seeing the sex in it.

1072
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,180
You're saying the stamina.

1073
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,860
I'm seeing sexual stamina.

1074
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,280
You can't.

1075
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,360
You all you gravitate towards the sexual nature of Minnie.

1076
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,880
Isn't this the isn't that what happens when the most repressed person hears anything?

1077
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,920
That's all they can see.

1078
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,480
You know, that's all they're obsessed with.

1079
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,020
But I think that one the mid that one line, I'm not that's not much of a reach.

1080
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,820
I don't think so.

1081
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,060
What did he knows just what to do about what?

1082
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,440
What would he know just what to do about in regards to many?

1083
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,040
I don't like what to get at the grocery store.

1084
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,500
What did you get for birthday?

1085
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:25,600
I this to me is like you're getting offended in that way, like to bring the doors up or like the with the kind of like relatively tame lines they would have to censor on the Ed Sullivan show.

1086
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,240
Yeah, I didn't get much higher.

1087
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,160
I couldn't get much higher.

1088
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,440
They're talking about drugs.

1089
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,680
Let's spend the night together rolling stones on the end.

1090
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,600
Sullivan, they had to say, let's spend some time together.

1091
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,820
This is a lude song I've ever heard.

1092
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:42,000
I think that line is more dirty, though, than let's spend the night together.

1093
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,100
But you don't wait, wait, say it again, though.

1094
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,260
Say it again.

1095
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,720
Now the she knows just what to do.

1096
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,860
I don't have to say, please.

1097
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:59,440
Yeah, on its own is like filthy, filthy, filthy line, filthy lyric.

1098
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,960
Many think about like cleaning the dishes.

1099
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:02,980
Well, let's see.

1100
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,340
Is there any other here?

1101
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,500
I'm happy to be wrong.

1102
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,200
But is there any more after this that would give a little more contact?

1103
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,420
Let's hear it.

1104
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,400
Every time I see a lot of other mice try, but they couldn't be him.

1105
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,220
He never let me down in a cartoon yet.

1106
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,760
Once you get to know him, he's the kind of mouse that you never forget.

1107
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,720
Well, OK, listen to the way she says that last line.

1108
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,420
He's the kind of mouse you'll never forget.

1109
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:27,380
You'll never forget.

1110
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,040
That's lust.

1111
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,440
Yeah.

1112
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,120
Yeah.

1113
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,360
I mean, it is a look.

1114
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,180
It is based on a horny song.

1115
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,140
The song is very old.

1116
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,720
The original song, very horny.

1117
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,100
But they didn't take the they really needed to get to take all of that out.

1118
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,360
And they did not do a good job.

1119
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,480
That was left over in here.

1120
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,580
And I'm not look, I'm many as feel as free to express herself in any way she'd like.

1121
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,880
I'm just saying I'm a little surprised by it on this album.

1122
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,640
That's all.

1123
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,380
Well, it's very, I guess, very forward, but very pioneering in a way.

1124
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,780
And that's right to the upfront with sexuality.

1125
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,620
And there's nothing wrong with it.

1126
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,160
Exactly.

1127
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,600
Yeah.

1128
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,920
So I'm just surprised.

1129
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,060
That's all.

1130
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,660
Can we hear chorus?

1131
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,120
Can we skip the chorus if we can try?

1132
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,000
I can try to do that.

1133
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,420
Let's see here.

1134
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,960
Because there's one more, I think that's a good.

1135
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,380
Okay.

1136
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,820
If you're if you're.

1137
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,500
He's got a sense of humor and it's taken him far.

1138
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,200
He's not a fake wannabe trying to be a star.

1139
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,820
He's got his own style no matter what the scene.

1140
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,300
Makes a cool fashion statement.

1141
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,700
He's the mouse of my dreams.

1142
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,420
Yeah, my mouse says he loves me.

1143
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,560
Never says he loves me.

1144
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,400
Now he takes me out for cheesecake.

1145
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,720
And all the right spots, other guys that I met, they don't impress me a bit.

1146
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,880
And every time they try, I say that's not it.

1147
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,280
Nikki loves that cheese.

1148
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,560
She's buddy loves that nut.

1149
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,680
T whiz.

1150
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,660
I say that's not it.

1151
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,100
Is many talking about me there?

1152
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,680
I mean, she's not about my but is she is she throwing shade at me?

1153
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,860
Now the guys show up at Park photo ops.

1154
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,360
Older men with no one around.

1155
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,120
If they do have a girlfriend, she's nowhere to be found.

1156
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,180
I make a smooch and say, go away.

1157
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,860
I hope that man's locked up one day.

1158
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,760
I'm pretty good.

1159
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,200
I'm pretty good at this rap game.

1160
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,100
Come on.

1161
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,800
When it's the character you understand.

1162
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:39,420
Yeah.

1163
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:39,800
Yeah.

1164
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,160
Yeah.

1165
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,380
Okay.

1166
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,840
So let's let's see what else we got here.

1167
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,100
He better know.

1168
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,680
Yeah, she knows.

1169
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,300
Good mice are hard to find.

1170
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,180
Wow.

1171
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,300
Well, that's the winner so far.

1172
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,320
Yeah.

1173
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:03,620
Yeah.

1174
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,820
I think that's I mean, that's a that's a really solid.

1175
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:11,960
If you had questions about the quality of the album and tracks one and two, three and four, that's a real good stretch.

1176
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,080
But does it maintain in track five?

1177
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,960
I don't know the answer.

1178
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,740
I don't even remember which of you covered this one.

1179
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,320
I know that's me.

1180
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:25,980
And all right, everyone buckle up for Bow Wow to the Beat featuring Whoopi Goldberg.

1181
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,400
Oh, Mike.

1182
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,920
Yeah.

1183
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:29,900
Hit it.

1184
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,200
Hit that beat.

1185
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,060
Here I said there was no G funk on it.

1186
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:11,520
Yeah.

1187
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,760
All right.

1188
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,200
Cut it.

1189
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:25,540
Cut it.

1190
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,120
Okay.

1191
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:26,460
Okay.

1192
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:32,160
So this song should just be called Whoopi Goldberg's explains dogs to you.

1193
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,180
She first of all, it's not featuring what we go.

1194
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,700
It is starring what we go.

1195
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,260
What we go.

1196
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:41,800
Berg is the main star of the song.

1197
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,340
Yeah.

1198
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:47,420
And if I heard Whoopi Goldberg rap, I don't think I had I kind of wasn't prepared for that.

1199
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,080
Interesting.

1200
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,700
So but is she talking about Pluto or goofy or great question.

1201
00:59:52,700 --> 01:00:00,560
So about a minute in, there's still no mention of Pluto about two minutes and three seconds and you finally get the Pluto.

1202
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,320
But can you jump to like one forty five real quick?

1203
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,240
Yes.

1204
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,980
Because then something else happens before.

1205
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,720
Stop that.

1206
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,740
Come over here and behave.

1207
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,100
Now, come on and let me think.

1208
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:16,720
Stop biting me.

1209
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,100
Let me see this song.

1210
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,720
Okay.

1211
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,680
Cut it.

1212
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,140
Cut it.

1213
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,740
So in the middle of the song, she just yells at a dog for some reason.

1214
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,420
And you're saying up until this point, there's still no mention of any Disney dog or.

1215
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,640
No, still still no mention.

1216
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,460
If you hit play from this point on, we start to get to him.

1217
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:35,880
Okay.

1218
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,400
All right.

1219
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,000
Okay.

1220
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:03,400
So just to repeat that line is on a scale of eight, he's a big K9.

1221
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,520
And then she goes, I like that.

1222
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,800
Scale of eight.

1223
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,340
I guess that ever used.

1224
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,560
Let's think about this.

1225
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:15,500
If you went on a scale of scale of ten, he's a big K9.

1226
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,300
It makes it seem like he's not the best.

1227
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,140
You have to make him sound the best, but you can't rhyme nine with K9.

1228
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,720
So they have that.

1229
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,820
They decided on eight.

1230
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,300
I get the conundrum they were in.

1231
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Yeah.

1232
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,600
The scale of eight is strange.

1233
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:29,980
Hmm.

1234
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,760
Interesting one.

1235
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,700
I mean, good for her for being being game.

1236
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,160
Yeah.

1237
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,580
So the song ends.

1238
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:42,600
And at some point she says the dog's got a brand new bag and a scooper, too.

1239
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:49,400
If you recall the 1990s, Pooper Scooper was the big comedy reference de jour of the time.

1240
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,700
We had one sold on TV product.

1241
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,220
Sure.

1242
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:59,660
And then a thing that happens like on most tracks on this album is they all kind of fade out in the same way.

1243
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:07,840
And when this one fades out, you can hear what the Goldberg very quietly saying, what did you put on the side of my pant leg?

1244
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,380
So like Pluto Pete on her.

1245
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,140
Like one of the dogs defecated on her in some way.

1246
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:20,740
So Pluto made we think it was Pluto or do you think it was just because there's a lot of dogs in this?

1247
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,420
It's hard to say.

1248
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,940
Yeah, there's like a wrecking crew of singers and a wrecking crew of dogs in this track.

1249
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,440
So could be any number of dogs.

1250
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,860
Any number is possible.

1251
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,800
Could have been Beethoven, Lassie, Renton, also referenced.

1252
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,300
That's true.

1253
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:34,600
Yeah.

1254
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,140
He doesn't own as well.

1255
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,540
Speedy was referenced earlier.

1256
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,200
Get some shade thrown at them, too.

1257
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,900
Yeah, Beethoven was not Disney.

1258
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:47,980
So they're referencing more like it's open season apparently with different characters not owned by the Disney company.

1259
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,400
Well, they got this right about rap of the time.

1260
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,620
This feuds.

1261
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,340
They're like they're calling out other companies IP.

1262
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,420
Yeah, I think it's great.

1263
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,680
Yeah, but they should take it a step further and say we're going to shoot Beethoven.

1264
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,620
Pluto is going to shoot Beethoven.

1265
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,660
Put him down in the middle of a field.

1266
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,040
Pop pop.

1267
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,060
His misery.

1268
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,380
Uh huh.

1269
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,840
All right, Jason, you want to go to the next one here?

1270
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,320
Yeah.

1271
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,600
So track number six, DJ goof.

1272
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,040
Oh, no.

1273
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,000
Uh huh.

1274
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,300
All right.

1275
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,060
Here we go.

1276
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,380
Here we go.

1277
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,140
Graduation theme.

1278
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:24,980
Break.

1279
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,320
Very loud.

1280
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:32,780
Mr.

1281
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,880
DJ goof.

1282
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:34,660
Hit it.

1283
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:42,780
Now he's a DJ and he's gone to school to learn the golden rule about scratching in fashion spinning records on the school.

1284
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,440
He's going to do his best and put it to the test and the rest is up to the beat.

1285
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:48,460
OK.

1286
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:50,520
All right.

1287
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,920
The premise of this.

1288
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:52,940
Yeah.

1289
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,520
Yeah.

1290
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:04,160
Is that goofy is going to a higher an Institute of Higher Learning for rapping and DJ for scratching for scratching for scratching.

1291
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:04,820
Yeah, sorry.

1292
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,100
And and they say he graduated summa cum laude.

1293
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,380
Very loud.

1294
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,300
Which I think is meant to be goofy makes a lot of noise.

1295
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,820
But I like to think it works in that goofy is smoking that loud.

1296
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:23,260
He is smoking the loud loud as a sign term for very potent marijuana.

1297
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,560
Well, Jason, you've enlightened me yet again on this podcast.

1298
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:27,640
I did not know that.

1299
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:27,960
Yeah.

1300
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,400
Yeah.

1301
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,560
Puts it over our heads.

1302
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,060
Yeah.

1303
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,420
So are you Jason?

1304
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,380
Are you getting loud?

1305
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:33,860
Are you?

1306
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:34,820
Are you?

1307
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,080
Would you say never before I record Michael?

1308
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,480
Never.

1309
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,880
No, I like to be sharp.

1310
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,380
You're too sluggish.

1311
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:46,180
But they do really dig in their heels on the higher education thing.

1312
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,460
Later on, he says rap alumni.

1313
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,600
That's me.

1314
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,320
But you can call me goof.

1315
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:52,840
J.

1316
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,600
D.

1317
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,300
J.

1318
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:54,460
D.

1319
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,100
is a law degree.

1320
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,180
What?

1321
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:03,880
But also in this song, he seems very confused by the trappings of DJ.

1322
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,080
Like he doesn't know.

1323
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,920
He says, where is the base?

1324
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,280
Guess I left it in the backbeat.

1325
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,080
So he kind of knows everything.

1326
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,440
But if he had graduated summa cum laude, pretty good in terms of graduating honors.

1327
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:27,180
But goofy, he's going to school to learn the golden rule about scratching.

1328
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:36,540
There's a thing on this record where they do very rudimentary rhymes and then seem very pleased with themselves at what they've accomplished.

1329
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,160
Mickey congratulates himself.

1330
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:39,620
Whoopies.

1331
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,680
That's good.

1332
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:41,860
Yeah.

1333
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,400
There's a lot of two acknowledging wordplay.

1334
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:52,120
Like the other guy says, give me a beat and goofy goes, wouldn't you rather have an apple?

1335
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,120
Like, come on, man.

1336
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,940
Fuck off with that shit.

1337
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,600
Get out of here.

1338
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,080
So is there any other part of this song we need to hear?

1339
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,400
No, not really.

1340
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:03,940
I think you got the gist of it.

1341
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:04,420
All right.

1342
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,080
I'm so relieved every time.

1343
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,940
That's the answer.

1344
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:07,600
Yeah.

1345
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,100
OK.

1346
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:08,880
Ducks in the Hood.

1347
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,000
Ducks in the Hood.

1348
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:10,820
Yeah.

1349
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,040
We have seen very little of Ducks in the Hood.

1350
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:14,200
Uh oh.

1351
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:14,520
All right.

1352
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:14,880
Here we go.

1353
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,300
Get it.

1354
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:40,380
Yeah.

1355
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,360
We're all just eerily silent here.

1356
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:46,860
No, it's creepy.

1357
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,840
Oh, them.

1358
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,780
OK, you can cut it there.

1359
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:58,660
Oh, are you sure?

1360
01:06:59,200 --> 01:06:59,440
Yeah.

1361
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,600
So there's a few things going on.

1362
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:06,240
One, this song appears to be about the school to prison pipeline.

1363
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,600
Maximum security kindergarten in Anaheim.

1364
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:12,500
Right.

1365
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,640
Huey, Dewy and Louie are going to kindergarten in Anaheim.

1366
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,180
Yeah.

1367
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,220
I guess in Toontown.

1368
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,380
Is it Toontown?

1369
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,180
Well, at some point they say, like, crowds of children have gathered in front of the

1370
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:29,320
Magic Kingdom castle as if there's about to be a riot.

1371
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,220
But this is what I was talking about.

1372
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,320
This sounds like the B team of Huey, Dewy and Louie.

1373
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,700
I don't know, though, because I was thinking who was their voice?

1374
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,580
And I just checked and it is Rue C.

1375
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,040
Taylor.

1376
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,020
So they had her.

1377
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:47,760
I will say that.

1378
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:53,200
I think maybe it's just maybe what you're hearing is that she is, again, not at ease

1379
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:53,840
with rapping.

1380
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,880
Humiliated, you could say.

1381
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,640
She's feeling humiliated.

1382
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:04,880
She was, according to Wiki, 50 years old when doing this.

1383
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,320
So tough age to be rapping.

1384
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,200
Well, then maybe.

1385
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,320
Now there's plenty of north of 50 rappers.

1386
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:20,580
And plus, if you look through the glass in the studio and you're looking right in the

1387
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,560
eyes of Phil Spector, I'd like you to not sound nervous either.

1388
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,820
Oh, Phil produced this track?

1389
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,320
Phil Spector produced this track.

1390
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,980
Phil Spector and Rick Rubin.

1391
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,020
They did not decide.

1392
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:35,260
OK, so this is another one where they went with a parody title yet did not parody the

1393
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:35,640
actual song.

1394
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,440
This is not a parody of Boys in the Hood by EZ.

1395
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:46,040
No, but it's like imply it's confusing because it's like it's like that Aerosmith video

1396
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,940
game where it's like music has been outlawed.

1397
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,260
This is dangerous.

1398
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,300
Right.

1399
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:51,940
Yes.

1400
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,680
Revolution X.

1401
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:53,540
I think you're talking about.

1402
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,940
I'm talking about Revolution X.

1403
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:55,280
Yes.

1404
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,460
Because I don't know why Huey and Dewey and Louie are a problem.

1405
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,500
They there is an exchange where one of them says we throw down the rhyme and then another

1406
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
one says, yeah, then we pick it up again.

1407
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,000
And one of them says, hey, Louie, get a clue.

1408
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:14,820
That's right.

1409
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,640
Bold stuff.

1410
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,700
Yeah, this is yeah, they're paired.

1411
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,220
They're saying, oh, wow, they're so scary, these ducks.

1412
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,740
But of course, they're just loose on the streets of Anaheim.

1413
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,860
After being locked up in an elementary prison.

1414
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,720
At kindergarten, were they that young?

1415
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,280
Are the nephews that young?

1416
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,040
They're in kindergarten.

1417
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,720
I always thought of them as a little older.

1418
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,580
I thought elementary school maybe.

1419
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,360
Yeah, I felt like fifth grade, fourth, fifth grade.

1420
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,060
That's how they seemed to me.

1421
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:43,600
I don't want to go on a tangent, but like what was going on with that thing where Danny

1422
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,680
Pooty said, I don't have a lot of money.

1423
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,660
I make DuckTales money to Larry King.

1424
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,120
And people are like, hell yeah.

1425
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,240
You show.

1426
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,240
Yeah.

1427
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,260
Put Larry in his place and then Larry died.

1428
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,800
Like, what was all that?

1429
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,060
Why would why are we?

1430
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:00,860
Oh, is it funny?

1431
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:01,900
Did you watch the little clip?

1432
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,300
I yeah.

1433
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,160
Larry, they haven't.

1434
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,060
I feel like people were celebrating it like, oh, I don't know.

1435
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,300
In an annoying Twitter way.

1436
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,600
Like, I mean, that's just Twitter.

1437
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,360
You put Larry in your place, Danny.

1438
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:18,800
The context was funny because Larry said, what are your guilty pleasures?

1439
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:19,980
Your indulgences.

1440
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,740
And he said, like, oh, I like coffee and socks.

1441
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,420
And Larry goes, socks.

1442
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,600
No, I'm talking about what he's like.

1443
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,280
Well, what do you mean there?

1444
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:32,780
And he goes, I don't know, private plane or and Daniel goes, Larry, I'm a DuckTales.

1445
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:34,600
Not a really care.

1446
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,560
That is funny.

1447
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,980
I think it was like in an annoying way.

1448
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:38,760
Am I crazy?

1449
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,020
Every I mean, I see that, but that's everything on Twitter.

1450
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,040
There's trending and you're like, what?

1451
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,320
Why is this an issue now?

1452
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,340
Is this like a do I have to be?

1453
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,580
Do I have to sign a petition?

1454
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,580
DuckTales and Larry King?

1455
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,680
I mean, yeah, probably.

1456
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,980
It's probably a petition out there.

1457
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,740
But yeah, look, I don't know.

1458
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,560
The Twitter can ruin anything.

1459
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,000
Really can't.

1460
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,380
Yes.

1461
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:02,880
Yeah.

1462
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,440
Yeah.

1463
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,620
Things I love.

1464
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,800
Then I see tweets about it.

1465
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,380
I'm like, I don't like this anymore.

1466
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:08,340
Yeah.

1467
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,080
You like it.

1468
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,240
It's an annoying way.

1469
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,800
It's too much information.

1470
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,640
As I've said before, it's like Professor X and Cerebro.

1471
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,980
He's getting all the information from everyone's head at once in like on Earth and it's too

1472
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,600
much for him sometimes and he flips out and passes out.

1473
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,180
That's exactly what Twitter is.

1474
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,900
We shouldn't be getting too much that much information at once.

1475
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,440
Yeah.

1476
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,840
That's like the most beautiful way to put it.

1477
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:35,300
That being said, stay tuned to podcast the rights Twitter for updates about the only

1478
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,480
follow us.

1479
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,740
That's what my wife does.

1480
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,820
And she's right.

1481
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:39,880
Yeah.

1482
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,980
And like the 2000s design accounts that post like, oh man, look at this cool plastic watch

1483
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:45,880
that's real blobby.

1484
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:46,760
Yeah.

1485
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,960
And non-standard McDonald's.

1486
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,380
And non-standard McDonald's.

1487
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:50,580
Yeah.

1488
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,660
All those guys.

1489
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,840
The account that's just like weird Japanese mascots too.

1490
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:55,500
Oh yeah.

1491
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,120
Mondo Mascots.

1492
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:56,280
Yeah.

1493
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,380
Mondo Mascots is a mascot.

1494
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:57,860
Yeah.

1495
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:58,080
Definitely.

1496
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,040
All right.

1497
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,620
But we're going to stay.

1498
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,780
Now it's just going to keep growing.

1499
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,540
And then like this other guy, Tim Poole and this other guy.

1500
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,420
No.

1501
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,580
Oh no.

1502
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,080
You know about him.

1503
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:12,900
Okay.

1504
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:13,720
Anyways.

1505
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,140
Go to.

1506
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:15,600
Okay.

1507
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,460
And in the duck song, go to like 227.

1508
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,960
Here's an example of one of the fade out gags that are in this album.

1509
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,360
What did he say?

1510
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,420
He says, I'm so thirsty.

1511
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,640
My grape juice went everywhere.

1512
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,820
And then another one says, Hey, how come we're fading?

1513
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,080
We're not done yet.

1514
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:48,580
And then the third one says, I am.

1515
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:56,860
So that's kind of funny that they acknowledge that like someone should acknowledge that

1516
01:12:56,860 --> 01:13:00,600
like, yeah, every track on this album fades out the same way.

1517
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:01,760
Strange.

1518
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:07,540
Well, I mean, I would, I would like to think that the album was actually like double the,

1519
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,760
like double the length.

1520
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,160
And then somebody listened to it and went, Oh, God damn it.

1521
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:11,400
All right.

1522
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:16,900
Just fade out halfway through each song, just to make it shorter.

1523
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,400
We got to do something here.

1524
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,760
They didn't want to release like an all things must pass double album.

1525
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,080
Oh yeah.

1526
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,480
It was a double album.

1527
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,340
All the songs double the length.

1528
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,140
Yeah.

1529
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,800
Ice ice Mickey was 30 minutes long.

1530
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,100
You got to let it play out.

1531
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,380
It's an Odyssey.

1532
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,160
I'm doing work.

1533
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,880
I'm making art here.

1534
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:41,800
Okay.

1535
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,180
Yeah.

1536
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,580
We can go on to track eight MC Mickey.

1537
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,280
So finally the mouse is back.

1538
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,460
Right, right, right.

1539
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,620
As a long break on the talk about him.

1540
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,520
Yeah.

1541
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,480
So, okay.

1542
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:02,840
Okay.

1543
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,320
MC Mickey, he's the mouse that rocks.

1544
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,700
He turns up the boom in the bus.

1545
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,960
Going to send it out.

1546
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,160
Going to take it to the house.

1547
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,400
He's a rapper who's dapper.

1548
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,440
Yeah, he's the mouse who could do it.

1549
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:28,100
Got a positive message and you know he's into it.

1550
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,440
Talk about is.

1551
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,560
Oh, the better to hear the mouse continue saying.

1552
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,600
All right.

1553
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,880
Got it.

1554
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,740
Oh, oh, I see what that is.

1555
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,060
Yeah.

1556
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,360
That's a sample from the original from the 50s opening.

1557
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,300
Right.

1558
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:45,620
Yeah.

1559
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,720
They also yay Mickey.

1560
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:47,680
Yeah.

1561
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:52,220
They kind of remix the Mickey Mouse Club theme a little at parts.

1562
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:52,800
Yeah.

1563
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,740
And there's a little later.

1564
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,300
There's a little more of that coming of course in the album as well.

1565
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,020
Yeah.

1566
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:57,940
Oh yeah.

1567
01:14:58,940 --> 01:14:59,740
What else?

1568
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,340
Mine all got worse as they went on.

1569
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,300
Like it's hard to top the Whoopi Goldberg song and then MC Goof is pretty.

1570
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,300
DJ Goof.

1571
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,520
DJ Goof, sorry.

1572
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,520
Mickey is an MC.

1573
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,360
Yeah.

1574
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:20,260
And this is just, this sounds like a guy that got like an assignment to like put over Mickey

1575
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:20,880
as an MC.

1576
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,040
It's like, Hey, you know, make Mickey look good.

1577
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,580
He's not actually that good of an MC.

1578
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,560
If you could get on this track though, people might believe you.

1579
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,080
And he's like, all right, I'll do my best.

1580
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,500
And this is his effort to like make us confuse us maybe into thinking, Oh yeah, Mickey is

1581
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,120
a good MC.

1582
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,360
He really knows how to rhyme, but it's that's bullshit.

1583
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,140
Mickey's not a good, he's not a good MC.

1584
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:40,940
No offense, Mickey.

1585
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:41,300
Sorry.

1586
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,920
He's good at plenty of other things.

1587
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,080
You almost everything else he's tried.

1588
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,300
He's pretty good at.

1589
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,940
Not this.

1590
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,140
Let's be honest.

1591
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,080
He says at some point, guess I'm a wannabe.

1592
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,040
I just want to be me.

1593
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,820
These are not the rhymes are not clever.

1594
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,000
They're not, you know, he's not spitting them with fire.

1595
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,420
There's no fire.

1596
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,080
It's a lot.

1597
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:10,140
A lot of these songs sound like if you take an improv class and they're like, okay, this

1598
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,640
warmup is called build a rap.

1599
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:15,900
And everyone tries to like rap together and it, it kills a couple.

1600
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:20,420
It makes you be spontaneous in the moment and it gets you used to looking foolish and

1601
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,500
trusting your classmates.

1602
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,560
But it is often excruciating to do and see.

1603
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:37,400
We humiliate ourselves in empty theaters down on Santa Monica.

1604
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,360
The chains I forged in life to podcast.

1605
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,840
What else?

1606
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,960
Oh, jump to two minutes, 40 seconds.

1607
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,260
All right.

1608
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:48,600
Two minutes.

1609
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:55,980
No.

1610
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,080
All right.

1611
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:00,300
WALT.

1612
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,620
WALT.

1613
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:02,140
Yeah.

1614
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:10,920
The DJ goof at some point says like brought to you by WD and it's like, I don't know that

1615
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,240
Walt would sanction this buffoonery.

1616
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,600
I don't know that it is brought to you by WD.

1617
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,900
WALT now it carries Glenn Beck's show and Sean Hannity's show.

1618
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:27,240
It's really the format has changed a lot since the nineties.

1619
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,560
It's changed a lot.

1620
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,960
Not any longer.

1621
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,900
R&P Rush.

1622
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,280
Yeah.

1623
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,220
So WALT.

1624
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,660
I like that bit of.

1625
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,440
I like that bit of canon.

1626
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,580
I don't know if that's anywhere else.

1627
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,240
They use that in ToonTown.

1628
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,860
I go like, that's clever.

1629
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,360
But it being a hip hop radio station.

1630
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,820
I don't know.

1631
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:51,540
Yeah.

1632
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:51,880
Walt.

1633
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:52,740
Yeah.

1634
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,200
OK.

1635
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,140
Yeah, that's bad.

1636
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,200
Yikes.

1637
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,240
Oh boy.

1638
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:00,260
Well, Mike, do you have anything that will change our mind about.

1639
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,560
Take it away, Michael.

1640
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,740
I don't have anything to change your mind.

1641
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,780
Here's a song called You Can't Botch This.

1642
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:10,000
Oh.

1643
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,080
Can't botch this.

1644
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,520
Can't botch this.

1645
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,140
Can't botch this.

1646
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,180
Can't botch this.

1647
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,900
My, my, my.

1648
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,200
I turned on the hose to water my lawn.

1649
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,900
I went inside and left it on.

1650
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,900
Now my yard is a great big lake.

1651
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,520
It did my garden wavering.

1652
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,320
It all got all covered in mud.

1653
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,180
So I gave him a bath in the tub.

1654
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,920
He farted out and shook his coat.

1655
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,900
Now I'm the one who got all soaked.

1656
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,600
The senseless things turn into a mess just when you're sure you can't botch this.

1657
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,260
Can't botch this.

1658
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,360
All right.

1659
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,020
I've heard.

1660
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,900
OK, now having heard all of your songs, the ones you guys have previewed, this is a lot

1661
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,380
better than some of them.

1662
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,020
Yeah.

1663
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:52,660
Sure.

1664
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:58,060
Interesting that all these songs are like a picture of domestic life, a birthday party

1665
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,580
chores around the house.

1666
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:00,780
You know?

1667
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,260
Yeah.

1668
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:05,000
You can't botch this, but it's goofy's botching everything.

1669
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,600
Yeah.

1670
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,340
At least.

1671
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,640
Botching is a funny word for it, too.

1672
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,200
I don't know why that makes me laugh.

1673
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:10,960
It's weird.

1674
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:14,260
You can't touch this and to botch this.

1675
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:15,200
Yeah.

1676
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,520
You botch is a word that I always associate with professional wrestling.

1677
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,000
If some move goes awry, people say it was a botch.

1678
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,640
But I don't think about it when goofy's doing housework until now.

1679
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:26,500
So.

1680
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,360
But yeah, it's obviously you can't touch this parody, which believe me goes farther on this

1681
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,420
album if it's a parody of a real song that's actually using the music, because we do have

1682
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,860
affection for the song itself.

1683
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,360
But yeah, that's basically I mean, there's.

1684
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,000
Can't botch this.

1685
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,220
There's like a little bit of business with like Pluto being feral.

1686
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,040
Cooking is simple.

1687
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,780
Easy as pie.

1688
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,440
Who needs to be?

1689
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,460
I'll just try.

1690
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,700
Cooking is simple.

1691
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,000
I went to a store and bought a bike.

1692
01:19:59,140 --> 01:19:59,680
Put it together.

1693
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,060
But it didn't look like there's handlebars in the back.

1694
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,420
You see, in an extra wheel where the seat should be.

1695
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,240
One or two shirts.

1696
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,060
I took a guess it's set on the box.

1697
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,680
You can't watch this.

1698
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,440
It's set on the box.

1699
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,560
It's like they're close to like having a premise that makes sense.

1700
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,620
But it's like it says on the box, you can't botch this.

1701
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,040
That type.

1702
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,160
It's like things for dummies.

1703
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:21,840
Yeah.

1704
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,240
So I get where they're going, but this feels like a bit of a first draft, though I do like it.

1705
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:30,540
The Disney characters, they're all they're all bad, I guess, at everything as well.

1706
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:35,100
So this is this implied this is this like folksiness that runs through this.

1707
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,440
And maybe I say that because of Goofy's accent.

1708
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:45,600
But like in general, yeah, the bacon, the cake, it's like they're all is the comedy of the Disney characters that they're like

1709
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,820
They're like so they're this folksy down home.

1710
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:57,400
And yeah, we get ourselves in a fix and the dog ends up running through the laundry line and gets messed everywhere.

1711
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,900
But then we break bread and we are thankful for our day together as a family.

1712
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,620
I think that this is I think this is very mama's family.

1713
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,500
I think that's correct.

1714
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,500
I assume you watched a lot of mama's family growing up as well.

1715
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:15,780
I don't mama's family is one of those things that like as soon as it came on out, out, hate, hate this.

1716
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:16,560
Yeah, I like it.

1717
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:24,700
I like I said that's why I don't what I just said is not an accurate reflection of what mama's family is because I've run for the hills every time it's appeared.

1718
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,160
I don't know either.

1719
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,680
It sounds like you're describing the Waltons.

1720
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:37,280
Yeah, it's that this is like 70s television, like wholesome.

1721
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:38,220
Yeah.

1722
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:41,460
I believe we have a little fun, but not too much.

1723
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:41,880
Right.

1724
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,580
It just feels like this is probably a TV that you were raised on.

1725
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,160
That's all I'm that's all I was saying.

1726
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:46,640
Oh, yeah.

1727
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,640
Well, I watched the 90s version of it.

1728
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,480
Seventh heaven.

1729
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,080
Right.

1730
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:55,140
There's so much seventh heaven in my house, which boy was it hilarious.

1731
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,900
Then when the star of the show turned out to be the biggest creep in the universe.

1732
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:05,300
Yes, I call this like my family truly did not know what to do.

1733
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:11,060
It's just like, well, slide the DVDs to the back of the shelf.

1734
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,260
I suppose.

1735
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,520
What a day that must have been.

1736
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,500
I wasn't actually there.

1737
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,060
I've never talked about it.

1738
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,600
And if I did this, it would change the subject.

1739
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,220
Right.

1740
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,380
Let's talk about politics instead.

1741
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,780
So, yeah.

1742
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,080
OK, so you can't watch this.

1743
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:29,600
I don't know.

1744
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,400
There's nothing too much more exciting.

1745
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,260
Like, that's my thing.

1746
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,060
I bought a guitar and I started to sing.

1747
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,680
But every time that I begin, the neighborhood dogs, they all join in.

1748
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,360
I went outside in my underwear.

1749
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,440
The door blew shut.

1750
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,420
I stuck out there.

1751
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,100
Pulling a bus full of kids.

1752
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,060
You know what they said?

1753
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,360
I can't watch this.

1754
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,180
Why?

1755
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:46,480
OK.

1756
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:46,840
What?

1757
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,040
Yeah.

1758
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,480
First of all, Mickey's playing guitar.

1759
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,060
He's bad at it.

1760
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:51,520
Dogs holler.

1761
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:51,960
All right.

1762
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:52,120
Fine.

1763
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,560
He botched playing the guitar for the first time.

1764
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,160
Whatever.

1765
01:22:55,540 --> 01:23:01,380
Goofy went outside, got locked out because he was in his underwear and a bus of kids

1766
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,220
drove by and yelled, You can't botch this, Adam.

1767
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,480
What?

1768
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:06,860
Why would that happen?

1769
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,040
What is this first draft?

1770
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:08,360
This isn't…

1771
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,020
It should be like, You screwed up.

1772
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,020
It should be something that said like, Oh, you screwed up.

1773
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,940
But like, You can't botch this.

1774
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,220
You can't botch going out of your house?

1775
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,280
I don't know.

1776
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,080
Yeah.

1777
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,140
Hey, mama's family update.

1778
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,180
There's a divorce involved behind the scenes.

1779
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:31,220
Carol Burnett is pissed because someone else took over a role.

1780
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,800
This is a spinoff of the Carol Burnett show.

1781
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,540
Yeah, it was a character from Carol.

1782
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,620
It's why it looks like a broad sketch character.

1783
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,220
Yeah.

1784
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:43,800
And, you know, for the most part, some of these characters look like they were storming

1785
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,580
the Capitol.

1786
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,340
Does this picture, just these vibes, these folks are giving off.

1787
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,520
Mama wanted to be there, but mama's in such poor health.

1788
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,220
Yeah.

1789
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,820
She sent the boys instead.

1790
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,520
Not during a pandemic.

1791
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,580
Which is fake, by the way.

1792
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:05,860
Even though mama…

1793
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,080
They won't admit that mama got COVID.

1794
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,220
Yeah, half of mama's family.

1795
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,600
Mama's family got cut in half by COVID, but they still won't acknowledge it.

1796
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,640
Still don't believe it.

1797
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,160
Flu was really bad this year.

1798
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,140
Moving on.

1799
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,300
This next one's called Little Red Rapping Hood.

1800
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,720
Oh, come on.

1801
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:32,280
This is another one where it's like, what are we doing here?

1802
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:32,680
What is…

1803
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:37,100
I know there's like a red riding hood in the Big Bad Wolf.

1804
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:50,260
I will say, because the Disney characters aren't on it, there is some more legit stuff in here.

1805
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:56,780
Like that eye level bass that walks down, if you hear that again, I think that's a pretty good bass line.

1806
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,960
And it's got some energy to it.

1807
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:25,000
This woman is one of the more talented performers.

1808
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,920
I mean, I said what are we doing here?

1809
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,820
Because I don't know what this is doing on here, but it is better than most of the other stuff.

1810
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,200
Yeah.

1811
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,700
And yet, don't you like…

1812
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:40,020
You almost want it to be worse in order to be something.

1813
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,680
I mean, you do get…

1814
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,040
You finally get some characters.

1815
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,880
So like Minnie is like Little Red Riding Hood now.

1816
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,620
And then she's talking to a wolf who's not one of the Disney characters, who's just the Big Bad Wolf.

1817
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,040
No, the Big Bad Wolf from the three…

1818
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,680
Oh, you're saying that's probably…

1819
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,340
They're trying to do his voice from the thing.

1820
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:21,620
I don't know.

1821
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:21,900
It doesn't sound…

1822
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:25,440
Yeah.

1823
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,880
The guy goes, oh yeah, or something.

1824
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,140
Does the Big Bad Wolf go, oh yeah, or anything in those old cartoons?

1825
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:31,840
I don't remember.

1826
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,380
I don't recall.

1827
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,720
Yeah, I don't know what's going on here.

1828
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,620
This maybe could have been a trim.

1829
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,720
Just got like off the game, I think.

1830
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,220
Right.

1831
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,920
But again, yeah, save the bass line for something.

1832
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:51,700
It's like…

1833
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,940
I mean, you are like, oh, thank God that woman came in to stop Minnie from having to rap.

1834
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:56,640
Oh God.

1835
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,440
More, please.

1836
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:58,560
Put this…

1837
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,520
Let this poor woman go home.

1838
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,620
Anyway, that's Little Red Riding Hood.

1839
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,540
Let's get to Mickey Mouse Club Mix.

1840
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,340
Oh, oh, this is the theme?

1841
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:12,660
It's going to be like the Bat Dance.

1842
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,420
So you got a sample there.

1843
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,640
Is this going to do a record scratch?

1844
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,470
Oh no, it's just at up tempo.

1845
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,900
Maybe this is my favorite one, weirdly.

1846
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,460
Well, as far as the genre, I have a lot of affection for this.

1847
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,560
Kind of jock jammy.

1848
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,460
Yes.

1849
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,300
This has energy.

1850
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,720
Come on, come on.

1851
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,260
Get it, get it.

1852
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,340
No, no, no.

1853
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,960
Yeah, that Mickey comes in and he kind of ruins it.

1854
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:58,540
Yeah, exactly.

1855
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,240
Stay out of the music, Mickey.

1856
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:01,600
Yeah, yeah.

1857
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,020
They kept playing that original sample where he says a lot going on today, you would have heard.

1858
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,600
America has invaded the Korean Peninsula.

1859
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:17,000
If you play, yeah, if you continue that, it was on the original track.

1860
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,040
Yeah, these are all these.

1861
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,440
There's a lot of great like old early 90s, like club mixes like this.

1862
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,640
And I'm trying to think of the names of some of the best ones.

1863
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,360
That's worthy of, you know, it's adjacent to Quad City DJs.

1864
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1865
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:37,800
Yeah, on the pre-proto Quad City DJ.

1866
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,620
So yeah, then Mickey comes in and he ruins it.

1867
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,620
But that's the I mean, that's the gist of it.

1868
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:50,260
You know, there's still a little more of the samples to be had, which is not so great.

1869
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,140
Get right to the get to the beat.

1870
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,880
Get to something we can dance to here.

1871
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:56,940
I kind of like this.

1872
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,640
Yeah, there's a nice little guitar in there.

1873
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,980
Crystal Waters.

1874
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:03,680
100 percent.

1875
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,480
And then like the sample.

1876
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,240
No, get the fuck out of here with that sample.

1877
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,480
Yeah, I don't.

1878
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,740
OK, boo boo.

1879
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,100
Oh, yeah.

1880
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,380
All right.

1881
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:16,900
Back to OK.

1882
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,400
OK, yeah, here we go.

1883
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,160
Yeah, I'm a dancer, man.

1884
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,620
Mickey, like a lot of that pronunciation or enunciation.

1885
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:29,760
Yeah.

1886
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:30,980
So so that's good.

1887
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:36,220
I mean, I would put a chop out those bad samples and you could put that on a CD.

1888
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:37,000
You could put that on.

1889
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,300
You could DJ a party with that.

1890
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,560
I don't think there would be a problem there.

1891
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:45,100
But you've already got a cool Mickey Mouse Club, you know, in Orlando.

1892
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,120
They're covering that with who some of who become the dominant pop stars in the world.

1893
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,820
So let these future pros handle it.

1894
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:53,520
Yeah, exactly.

1895
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,960
Why are why are these?

1896
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,120
Why is this anonymous club mix here?

1897
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:00,600
I mean, it says it's the tired old refrain of this episode.

1898
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,780
What are we doing here?

1899
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:08,700
I did want to say in that in the one track earlier, MC Mickey, that saxophone solo

1900
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:13,700
sounds like something from, I think, a current song.

1901
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,080
And it was driving me crazy.

1902
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,220
Like, and I could not figure out what it was.

1903
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,980
I think it's a newish song or it's a song that is new to me.

1904
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,800
And I still have not found the answer of what that sax sounds like.

1905
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,380
But I swear there is a hit song that just ends with a saxophone recently.

1906
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:32,940
I don't know.

1907
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,120
Well, we'll have to ask the listeners.

1908
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:34,760
I know.

1909
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,580
I think there is one.

1910
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,960
I don't know what it is.

1911
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,880
Yeah.

1912
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,200
Hmm.

1913
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,680
Not that with it.

1914
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,600
Where does where where does this go?

1915
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,300
Where do we go?

1916
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:47,980
Well, we go to the color of music, which is a song featuring color me bad.

1917
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,680
Uh huh.

1918
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:54,640
Star power at the end is yes, star power at the end, which of course color me bad does

1919
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,000
the song I want to sex you up.

1920
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:57,960
Mm hmm.

1921
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,980
And they sure do.

1922
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:00,660
Yeah.

1923
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:05,900
They are fairly embarrassing to look at if you look at photos of them.

1924
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:14,320
They probably wish that they didn't exist to be to be got that there's some funny

1925
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:14,840
recent.

1926
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,460
You talk about recent photos.

1927
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:17,720
No, I just know.

1928
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,920
Look at them at the time.

1929
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,260
They look so insane.

1930
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:21,620
Oh, oh, I see.

1931
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:24,800
Weird laptops and Bell mustaches and George.

1932
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,140
Oh, as far as the look dies.

1933
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1934
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:29,900
The head, the pants, they all have like these like poofy leather pants.

1935
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:30,660
Mm hmm.

1936
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:35,380
I've there's some recent photos too that are a little so I'll say they're kind of like

1937
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,640
fedora guys now seem right.

1938
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,320
Yeah.

1939
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:43,980
There's a profile of them on a color me bad want to prove it.

1940
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,680
They're in it for the long haul.

1941
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:50,440
A feature on entertainer mag dot com.

1942
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,560
If they can get there.

1943
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,320
Make it anywhere.

1944
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:01,500
They're playing at the Casinos Ovation's live showroom on with the Brian Adams.

1945
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,240
All right.

1946
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:03,760
Parentheses maskless.

1947
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,020
Yeah, that's this week.

1948
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,750
These maskless audience.

1949
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:13,790
Call me bad singer arrested after pushing band member on stage.

1950
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:15,010
You hate to see it.

1951
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,870
You never want to see that Joe.

1952
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:20,950
Joe Perry showed Steven Tyler off the stage and he didn't get arrested.

1953
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:22,750
There's a video.

1954
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,270
Look at look up Google on YouTube search.

1955
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:28,090
Joe Perry kicks Steven Tyler off the stage.

1956
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:33,550
Joe Perry very clearly runs into Steven Tyler and knocks him off the stage into the audience.

1957
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:35,310
Probably out of anger.

1958
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:41,310
There's clips of Steven Tyler like messing with Joe Perry during concerts.

1959
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:48,170
He's clearly mad at the illusion of my two best friends jamming together.

1960
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:49,290
I'm sorry.

1961
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:49,630
I'm sorry.

1962
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,290
There's a bit of animosity over the years.

1963
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:54,630
So color me bad.

1964
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:57,470
That's going to happen to Jason and I at a live show one of these days.

1965
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:05,290
We're going to be happy to see each other again in person once and then it's all going to rain.

1966
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:06,410
I'm going to ramp the fuck up.

1967
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:08,230
This is going to kick me off stage.

1968
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:09,050
Yeah.

1969
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:10,370
And I'll deserve it.

1970
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:10,830
All right.

1971
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,250
The color of music.

1972
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:14,270
This is featuring color be bad.

1973
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,530
And this one I'm just like, what is this doing here?

1974
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:24,790
Well, we are all the same in the same.

1975
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:29,070
It was like a harmony song.

1976
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:51,290
They're just the Disney characters are all just sitting and nodding like they're in the front row of a president's funeral of a color me bad concert.

1977
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:53,170
That's also a president's funeral.

1978
01:33:56,330 --> 01:34:00,330
Nixon has died and color me bad will be here to tribute.

1979
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,590
But it's just I'm zooming through here.

1980
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:05,570
There's no Disney characters.

1981
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:07,290
Just color me bad harmonizing.

1982
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:09,070
And that's the end of the album.

1983
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:10,490
That's how it goes out.

1984
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:11,850
That's how it goes out.

1985
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:12,510
It's pleasant.

1986
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:13,590
I like the sound of it.

1987
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:14,250
It's very pleasant.

1988
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:15,230
Very nice.

1989
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,930
I don't know why that's at the end of the album.

1990
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:19,430
So there you go.

1991
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:21,530
That ends on a strange note.

1992
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:26,430
That's strange as yeah, as it causes us to do to.

1993
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:26,830
It's funny.

1994
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:35,110
I just watched an old Grammy Awards as I want to do where they do an acapella harmony thing, but kind of back to back to them.

1995
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:42,290
And then boys to men do the same thing and boys to men blow them out of the water like the audience does not respond at all.

1996
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:43,410
The color me bad and boys to men.

1997
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:46,730
Everyone like gets up and cheers and loses their mind.

1998
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,650
So it's not like this.

1999
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:52,390
The color me bad is that compelling doing what they're doing here.

2000
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:53,210
Right.

2001
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:55,210
But yeah, it's pleasant.

2002
01:34:55,330 --> 01:35:01,170
I just you're listening to a bunch of like cartoon characters try to do popular music.

2003
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:11,050
And then all of a sudden the album ends with like a nice little minute and a half from color me bad doing it like a sincere, like gospely kind of song.

2004
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:12,970
And that's it.

2005
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:14,590
It's the kiss.

2006
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:15,170
Good night.

2007
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,710
Yeah, that's true.

2008
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:17,630
That's true.

2009
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:19,910
It's a nice soft little kiss.

2010
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:21,250
Good night from color me bad.

2011
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:23,910
Everyone's every lady's dream.

2012
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:25,410
I want to kiss you.

2013
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:25,650
Good.

2014
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,650
I want to kiss you up.

2015
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:27,270
I want to kiss you.

2016
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:27,810
Good night.

2017
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:33,390
Out your hat fell in my eye poking me with your fedora.

2018
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:35,390
Strange.

2019
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:38,190
Well, they brought him in to do something not Disney ish.

2020
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:40,530
Maybe they just bought a color me bad track.

2021
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:42,090
Very possible sale.

2022
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:43,510
Yeah.

2023
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:44,490
Weird.

2024
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:46,810
Well, I don't know.

2025
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:48,250
Boy, that makes me feel uneasy.

2026
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:50,470
We didn't even get to go out on like a crazy.

2027
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,170
Well, I have something to say at the end of the episode.

2028
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:55,130
No, perfect.

2029
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:55,850
We could.

2030
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:57,930
It took into rescue us at this point.

2031
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:58,710
Yeah, yeah.

2032
01:35:58,990 --> 01:35:59,130
Save it.

2033
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:00,090
But now I have to rescue.

2034
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:06,590
I mean, to sum up, to sum up, I mean, you know, the album is like not particularly good in any of the directions.

2035
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:10,650
Like, it's not so horrible.

2036
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:12,130
That funky.

2037
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:12,750
It's not.

2038
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:13,330
It's not.

2039
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:15,610
Yeah, there's there's good parts, stuff we like.

2040
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:17,790
The comedy is not on a high level.

2041
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:18,470
I'll say that.

2042
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:20,170
I wouldn't say so.

2043
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:26,510
I didn't laugh at the things that are said, but the it's better than the cover.

2044
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:30,490
The cover is the most damning part of it.

2045
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:35,670
It almost like makes you wonder if this is like offensive, what we're going to experience.

2046
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:36,450
And then it wasn't.

2047
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:38,030
I wasn't offended other than that.

2048
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,790
I was not.

2049
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:40,910
I was not a fan of some of a little bit of it.

2050
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,310
But yes, this is this raunch coming out.

2051
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:45,850
This is coming from Minnie Mouse who needs to clean up her act.

2052
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:46,390
That's true.

2053
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:46,630
Yeah.

2054
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:48,770
Well, no, maybe I secretly like Minnie Raunch.

2055
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:52,470
I'm just talking about Mickey trying to make the white people feel OK.

2056
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:53,630
That's my problem.

2057
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:54,690
Squeaky clean.

2058
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,130
Yeah, sure.

2059
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,670
But yeah, I don't know.

2060
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:58,970
I mean, worth a trip.

2061
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:02,370
Thank you, listeners, for directing it.

2062
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:11,030
But I will I might have to say burn it to the ground for insurance money and not burn it like a like a CD would be burned.

2063
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:17,590
Yeah, I mean, I would say that's probably the closest I would rescue some of the baselines and maybe the club mix.

2064
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:22,490
I'll rescue that from the fire, but burn most of the rest of it down.

2065
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,910
Goofy smoking weed.

2066
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,570
This is a real good one.

2067
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:38,930
I've seen this this single still from an animated and he looks a little out of it.

2068
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:40,150
Oh, baby.

2069
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:41,110
Yeah.

2070
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:41,790
Yeah.

2071
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:42,230
Wow.

2072
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:48,110
I saw somebody I saw a picture of somebody who got vaccinated and they were wearing a Donald Duck smoking weed shirt.

2073
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:51,110
Well, so only the only the best.

2074
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:52,450
Well, sure.

2075
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:54,070
You got to relax.

2076
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:59,810
Well, I know no one's worn a pot tannic shirt yet while getting vaccinated.

2077
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:01,490
But I would really maybe I will.

2078
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,110
That's a great idea.

2079
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:11,090
If everybody who's getting vaccinated where they're puttanna kush pot tanna kush shirt, excuse me.

2080
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:26,770
Like, what a what a beautiful time capsule that would be.

2081
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:27,090
That's true.

2082
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:27,990
Yeah.

2083
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:29,710
We'll throw that out there.

2084
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:40,530
Pot tanna kush loves loves that loud and he loves those heroes and pot tanna kush.

2085
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,510
That's how to push.

2086
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:43,930
Let's get loud.

2087
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:46,610
Can we get a let's get loud shirt with pot tanna kush?

2088
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:48,210
It's here.

2089
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:49,190
Teakley scream.

2090
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,990
Let's get loud.

2091
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:52,750
Magdahl.

2092
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:55,210
The flop gloppel.

2093
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:56,130
Yeah.

2094
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:00,450
I'm sure there's a pot we could get pot.

2095
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:03,590
We'll come up with pot characters for all the other Green Planet friends.

2096
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:04,550
Oh, that's yeah.

2097
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:05,430
You should have buddies.

2098
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:06,250
That's true.

2099
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:07,010
Oh, yeah.

2100
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:08,450
Aaron might enjoy that assignment.

2101
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,950
The Brodo is Zoggy friends.

2102
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,390
That's ET's home planet.

2103
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:13,090
It's REC.

2104
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:14,030
ET's real name.

2105
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:18,230
Teakleaf is pretty good.

2106
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:18,550
Yeah.

2107
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:19,930
That is pretty good.

2108
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:24,950
And it's all yeah all weed leaves exploding out of their head.

2109
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:26,630
Okay.

2110
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:30,610
So here's what I want to you guys will help me workshop how we're going to do this.

2111
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,190
Okay.

2112
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:41,790
I have found something in my archives that I believe the listeners might be interested in hearing, but it is so humiliating to me.

2113
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:46,050
I would prefer that we give a goal of some kind on the Patreon.

2114
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:46,770
Whoa.

2115
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:49,990
I have found a full album of mine that I made.

2116
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:51,050
Excuse me.

2117
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,030
Oh, boy.

2118
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:53,310
Oh, my gosh.

2119
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:56,630
I have found a full album of music from when I was 20 years old.

2120
01:39:56,790 --> 01:40:00,690
I actually didn't realize I had even full like made this much.

2121
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:01,970
And I remember all of it now.

2122
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:03,590
But I went, oh, my God, you put it all.

2123
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:03,830
Yeah.

2124
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,510
And an album.

2125
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:06,210
And these are all songs.

2126
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:10,170
None of them meant to be ironic, all sincere.

2127
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:10,770
Oh, boy.

2128
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:11,450
Oh, boy.

2129
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:16,050
Really just the dumbest, most sincere, humiliating lyrics.

2130
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:17,170
Wow.

2131
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,250
Right after you've been saved.

2132
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:24,050
You know, some of them do.

2133
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:28,370
I was never religious, but some of them do sound vaguely religious if you listen to them.

2134
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:31,430
There was a lot of that in like rock music.

2135
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:31,990
Yeah.

2136
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:33,510
So here's the thing.

2137
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,790
This ain't coming cheap is what I'm going to say here.

2138
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:36,390
Yeah.

2139
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,510
This has to come at a price for patrons.

2140
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:42,930
We need to get to some astronomically high patron.

2141
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:47,490
That's the way I'm thinking of it is if we can hit a certain amount of patrons or something,

2142
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:53,830
we will unlock my music album from and we will dissect it on this spot on the Patreon.

2143
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:55,170
It has to be.

2144
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:56,530
Well, we get to hear it.

2145
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:57,690
It's not just you bring it out.

2146
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:58,410
No, no, no.

2147
01:40:58,430 --> 01:40:59,210
It'll be you guys.

2148
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:01,150
You can humiliate me with it.

2149
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:02,410
Like you can make fun of it.

2150
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:05,870
We can do a full analysis of it on the Patreon.

2151
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:09,630
But I'm this has we have to get so many more patrons.

2152
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:11,390
I don't know what the number is.

2153
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:13,310
Is it five thousand for that?

2154
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:14,950
Maybe it's four thousand.

2155
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:23,070
This has to be like a goal we're working towards for a while because I implore I'm telling you this is so embarrassing.

2156
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:25,510
I don't want to do this.

2157
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,490
So you're singing.

2158
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:28,650
You're like and playing everything.

2159
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:29,470
I'm playing.

2160
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:33,130
My friend John at the time is playing guitar and might do a little singing on it.

2161
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:37,370
But most of the songs are mine, my creation, my writing.

2162
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:42,010
And yeah, and it's just like the lyrics.

2163
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:46,110
I can't every cliche you'd ever have ever heard.

2164
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:49,030
It's all Matchbox 20 inspired.

2165
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:50,350
It's all boy.

2166
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:51,090
Oh, boy.

2167
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:56,750
There's one like there's one rock in the song on it that's like I guess we just heard the hives or something.

2168
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,710
And we're like, yeah, let's do that.

2169
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:01,630
And there's a bad drum machine on it.

2170
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:02,790
And oh, goodness.

2171
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:03,870
Oh, shit.

2172
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:10,650
Well, you know, I do commend you because I'm not sure I've ever made anything that's intended to be sincere,

2173
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:19,050
which is kind of like a like even in high school, I'm trying to do like it's like my I'm trying to be like a little Austin Powers or something.

2174
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,110
I was never willing.

2175
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:21,870
I'm too scared in a way.

2176
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:27,970
I like I I commend you for being fearless at that time to put your heart on the line.

2177
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:37,710
I think it was more stupidity because I was my trajectory as a human being was like, oh, I'm going to like do fun like movie acting stuff.

2178
01:42:37,710 --> 01:42:41,090
And we made videos at 14, 15, 16, 17.

2179
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,690
And then I started listening to music and I was like, music is serious.

2180
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:48,130
That's what you do when you're writing songs.

2181
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:50,310
Ah, maybe I will write songs as well.

2182
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,810
So I started writing songs and I'm like this.

2183
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:53,570
I'm trying to feel something.

2184
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:56,030
I am writing about important things like I don't know anything.

2185
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,810
I'm an idiot.

2186
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:04,710
I'm just mimicking Stephen Jenkins or I'm mimicking Adam Derwitt.

2187
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:09,870
I don't know what exactly you felt a feeling since you were 20, not as long as I've known.

2188
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:12,310
It's a very good.

2189
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:13,130
It was a very good chance.

2190
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:17,950
I really in hindsight, I was like, you know, you could have like, you know, you like to be funny and like movies or whatever.

2191
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:20,130
You could have tried to be funny in one of these songs.

2192
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:26,950
Crazy if you if you went back to your album and it was bizarrely like like and you had no idea.

2193
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:31,990
You didn't even remember you blocked it out in the album is just like, yeah, I want to lick that pussy and fuck.

2194
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:40,230
You're like, whoa, Mike loves cheese, likes cheese, but he loves that nut.

2195
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:46,810
I will still I have more seed.

2196
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:47,670
I'm going through CDs.

2197
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,690
This is how I found this.

2198
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:54,390
And I will let you know if I say anything about liking that nut in any of those.

2199
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:56,710
I don't think that exists, though.

2200
01:43:56,710 --> 01:44:00,970
I'm hoping you find like a bare naked ladies.

2201
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:03,670
They might be giants more like goofball.

2202
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:05,750
Well, I have I do you know what?

2203
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:12,570
In the band I was in, I do have some songs that are slightly comedic, but this is more of my solo work.

2204
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:19,590
This is not necessarily the work of second level, which I guess we could put some of second level stuff on there.

2205
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,690
This is more of my work.

2206
01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:23,050
That was the band I joined.

2207
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,150
It was already in progress.

2208
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:24,690
Yeah.

2209
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:28,690
And our friend Milos quit and then I joined the band as the singer.

2210
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:32,450
So that was your alter bridge.

2211
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:35,010
But your solo stuff is more like Scott Stapp solo.

2212
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:36,190
Yeah, that's true.

2213
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:40,730
But imagine you have Van Halen and David Lee Roth left and then Sammy Hagar joined, which is me.

2214
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:43,690
But then David Lee Roth came back as well.

2215
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:47,070
And we were both David Lee Roth and Sammy were in the band at the same time.

2216
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:50,310
That's what really, really was happening with second level.

2217
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:57,650
Well, what do we you know, one thing is that the second gate could get you might call a second level.

2218
01:44:58,110 --> 01:44:59,550
And that's possible.

2219
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,590
A reason to go there.

2220
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:04,710
The next tier of the picture is only you get this album.

2221
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:07,450
You get Mike's high school album and that's it.

2222
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:11,130
Well, and maybe my middle school performance.

2223
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:14,430
That was a 2020 project I was going to do.

2224
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,010
It's like, OK, I'll get together.

2225
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:18,710
We'll watch the entirety of my middle school play.

2226
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:22,150
We'll cut up what I should what we should put out.

2227
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:27,550
And then a pandemic happened and it took a back seat.

2228
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,590
Well, you don't have tapes.

2229
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:29,510
They're probably back at home.

2230
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:30,650
You know, I have it.

2231
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:30,990
You do.

2232
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:33,910
You were sitting on your this is revelatory.

2233
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:36,130
You're sitting on your high school, your middle school plays.

2234
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:37,550
I we talked about this.

2235
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:39,070
I have it.

2236
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:47,550
Yeah, I have a DVD, but we got to cut it up a little because I don't want to put on blast a whole two hour.

2237
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:48,310
Oh, yeah.

2238
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:57,750
All all the cast of thousands like 50 people or whatever those middle school where they just try to shove every kid who wants to do it in.

2239
01:45:57,930 --> 01:45:58,110
Right.

2240
01:45:58,210 --> 01:45:58,730
Well, you know what?

2241
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:59,290
Let's say that.

2242
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:05,290
Let's just let's let's stop it here because obviously we're going to have to announce this on the main show as far as because everybody is on the Patreon already.

2243
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,090
You know, they're in.

2244
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,030
So we're teasing this.

2245
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:09,050
This is going to be coming soon.

2246
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:18,090
There's going to be some sort of either a T another tier or a stretch goal to get to these treasures, these childhood treasures.

2247
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:19,730
You want to dig in the archive?

2248
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:20,590
You can find anything.

2249
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:21,850
I'm sure you've got something.

2250
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:27,670
The one that comes to mind and I cannot I don't want to tease this and say that it does not and then find out that it doesn't exist.

2251
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:40,090
But I think that there might be video of me dancing at a nine years old dancing at a Beach Boys concert after a baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium.

2252
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:48,890
They would like package it like see the full Padres game and then then a Beach Boys concert and the Stamos was there.

2253
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:52,470
I don't remember, but I think my dad may have taken video.

2254
01:46:53,410 --> 01:47:01,690
And if not that, then there also may be a video of my Boy Scout troop doing a lip sync to Little Deuce Coop.

2255
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:03,310
You mentioned this before.

2256
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:09,690
Now we're getting now we're getting maybe video of that one, maybe even more likely video of that one.

2257
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:21,010
Okay, so so we'll be announcing soon some kind of tier or stretch goal on the Patreon for all of you to enjoy some humiliation on our behalf.

2258
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:31,550
I don't know exactly what form it'll be in, but it's coming in some form because I was just listening to this and going, oh my God, I believe this exists.

2259
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:35,970
You're going to pay money for our humiliation.

2260
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:39,290
And that's totally that's fine and normal and good.

2261
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:40,570
That's like OnlyFans.

2262
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:42,650
That's how people are making money these days.

2263
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:43,310
That's a good point.

2264
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:44,450
Yes, that's a good point.

2265
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:46,770
Instead of like, yeah, I'm shirtless.

2266
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:55,230
You're paying to hear the sincere like crooning of a 20 year old who's trying to get in touch with any kind of emotion possible.

2267
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:56,830
Let's make this clear.

2268
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:59,170
This is much less dignified than only fans.

2269
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:00,750
That's a good point.

2270
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:03,150
It's good.

2271
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:04,710
You know, people can make money.

2272
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,690
God speed.

2273
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,030
God bless.

2274
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:07,670
Yes, you're right.

2275
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:09,530
It's much crappier.

2276
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:22,870
No one would take the Boy Scout troop performing Little Deuce Coop is not a cool path to go to.

2277
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:31,250
But but paying for I mean, like staying tuned to the picture and telling your friends to do so to see this and to hear all these things.

2278
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:31,910
That's great.

2279
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:33,990
The the embarrassment here.

2280
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:34,830
That's right.

2281
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:35,950
The embarrassment here.

2282
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:36,710
Yeah.

2283
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:37,490
Yeah.

2284
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:39,410
It sounds good to me.

2285
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:41,190
I got no problem with it.

2286
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:48,990
And then appropriate to bring up in an album that I think is mildly embarrassing for the voice actors, for the characters.

2287
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:54,970
So every one of you for Whoopi Goldberg potentially, it's a lot of embarrassment.

2288
01:48:55,610 --> 01:48:56,590
She gets out OK.

2289
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:58,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so.

2290
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:00,790
And and we're getting out OK.

2291
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:02,710
You survived podcast through the second gate.

2292
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:11,270
Stay tuned here, obviously, obviously, because you're going to get there's some very good content deep, deep in the archives that will be coming your way soon.

2293
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,890
And we'll figure.

2294
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:17,970
Yeah, we'll figure out how to how to get people to what what what will make it worth.

2295
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:18,990
I don't know.

2296
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:22,090
We're at like we're getting close to twenty five hundred, which is very exciting.

2297
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:22,510
That's great.

2298
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:25,110
Do you is it is twenty five thousand.

2299
01:49:25,610 --> 01:49:26,030
OK.

2300
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:26,970
All right.

2301
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:35,350
So so all your friends and enemies get as many people as you can do subscribe and hear Mike's record.

2302
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:38,970
But for now, yeah.

2303
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:41,470
Peace to your posse.
