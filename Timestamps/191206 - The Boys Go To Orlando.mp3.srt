1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,520
Warning, the following podcast contains

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,840
an e-ticket Disney World ride share,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,040
thick, wonderful humidity,

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,640
sauced people in saucy T-shirts,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,920
and two new members join a sauce-based squad.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,480
We're back from vacation.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,440
It's podcast, The Ride.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,240
Welcome.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,840
the globe-trotting theme park podcast

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,200
that brings talks of hotdogs and shamans

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,120
of song across the globe.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,400
My name is Mike Carlson.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,360
Joining me is always Jason Sheridan.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,320
Yes, I'm here.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,240
And Scott Gardner here as well.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,520
We sure did.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,080
And, you know, I'm glad that we have.

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm glad that we have gone and explored other places

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,920
and gone to another coast,

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,400
because as people are hearing this, just due to our schedule,

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,720
we have just everyone has just survived the downtown Disney ordeal,

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,960
which makes me not want to cover anything in Anaheim ever again.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
So I'm really glad we've got a lot of Orlando to talk about now.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,760
Yeah. So, yeah, no.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
We'll talk a little bit about the mall, the downtown Disney Mall,

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,080
which is down to Disney Springs here.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,920
But for the most part, obviously, we've been sent on.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
So we have some marching orders that we have to decide

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
whether or not to engage with.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,320
Yeah. But if you if you're just joining us, you got to recap.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
That's all that's all last month.

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,320
That's all, you know, so we don't want to leaving it there.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah. In our November of sorrow.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,600
I didn't think of it as being sad, but now I guess it is sad that we did that.

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,040
Our October of triumph followed by our November of sorrow.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,000
And that's life. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. Yeah.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,960
But today, yeah, today we're just going to talk about our trip.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
It's trip report. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,880
Is it recording this a little more a little closer to our

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,200
to the October triumph? Yeah.

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,800
Yeah, boy, we all went to Disney World together.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,360
That's pretty nice.

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,920
I think we knew it would happen at some point in time and the results

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,280
didn't disappoint. That was a blast, y'all.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah, we did it very fun.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,640
It did. Yeah, we we were invited by a wonderful comedy theater.

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,480
The sack comedy is at the lab.

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,320
That's probably lab.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,160
As I for some reason, my brain was like worried that that was wrong.

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
I was worried it was a theater, not a lab, but it is a lab.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,320
It is a lab. OK.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,040
I was worried I called the Chicago theater the wrong thing in the show,

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,480
but I don't think I did. But I'm not going to try again now.

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,280
Oh, yeah. Don't do it.

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,160
Theater work. Yeah, it's theater works.

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
And it was Chicago podcast festival.

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Yes. OK. So I said all right.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,400
And I said, all right now, they were also fantastic.

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
We're in Chicago.

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,960
I thought it was Chicago theater lab.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,480
I thought they were a lab as well.

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,120
No, no, Orlando is lab. Chicago is work.

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
OK. Yeah.

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,240
So, yeah, either either Sparrow Ogden, Dr.

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,320
Augustine, Dr. Ogden, Dr.

69
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,520
Augustine, which I guess is our Oprah Uma.

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,840
Yes. Yes.

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,480
Hopefully doesn't derail her future hosting career.

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,560
Yeah. But that was the you know, that was the Orlando live show, you know.

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,200
So listen, go back and listen to that.

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
We're going to give you some some new stuff, stuff you haven't heard yet.

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh, yeah. We didn't have time to talk about too much of our show.

76
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
We certainly talked about highlights during the show, but there's

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,240
so much more to talk about.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,840
We covered a lot of ground.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,640
Here's here's here's what I this is a big overall view of

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,040
I had not done Disney World

81
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,000
in my 30s, and I was definitely feeling it.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,920
I feel how it is different in my 30s.

83
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,000
I was more tired.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,320
I was less able to put up with the weather despite having a very good time.

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,800
A lot of the time, so many nights were like sleep.

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,280
How about sleep? Maybe that's the plan.

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,320
Sleep. On the other hand, Jason Sheridan,

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,640
I feel like you in Orlando are a new man.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,480
I said like a pig and shit like time of my son.

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,280
Surging with energy.

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,960
No one is sleepier that I know.

92
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,320
Maybe Lindsay. But second, Jason Sheridan.

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,240
And there's certain times in our friendship

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
when you've come alive.

95
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
It's maybe two or three times total.

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,040
But one is like Del Close Marathon years ago, where you're up to like 6 a.m.

97
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,560
Yeah. And I was like, what?

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,640
What did this come from? Sure.

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,840
Like versus like love for Dell is the answer.

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Yeah. Of course.

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,120
Love and respect for the great.

102
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
For the purest art for long form improv.

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,600
Why do you have to die?

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,920
God, no. He was.

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,040
I don't understand.

106
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
Angel among us. They do it all.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,960
Topsy, he was so young.

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,440
What could have gone to this?

109
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,520
Have it. Yeah.

110
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,600
You were you were like, I was like, oh, my.

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Well, who's this guy?

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah. And then, of course, we come back here and it's like years and years of.

113
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,840
Oh, that's Jason Jason sleepy.

114
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,880
Doesn't want to do anything.

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,760
Can't do stuff because three days from now he's leaving town

116
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,680
and he has to pack tonight. Yeah.

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,760
Like that's a thing.

118
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,000
I think maybe it was two days.

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Maybe I'm exaggerating.

120
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,200
Is it too? I think I still don't like it.

121
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,360
I've gotten better at it. I still don't like it.

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Like like packing. Packing gives me anxiety.

123
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,680
But like days before, I think you were unavailable because of packing.

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,560
You've got a wig to buy on the weekends.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Yes.

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,080
Overwhelmed easily and need a lot of sleep.

127
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
How much sleep a day?

128
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,720
How much sleep a day do you get or night?

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,760
Excuse me. I know I'm down.

130
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm like eight, eight or nine.

131
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,680
I'm much more regimented.

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,760
OK, since Orlando, I've been nine to ten.

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,400
It's still we're like a week out.

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,680
I yeah, I'm sleeping so I've been doing so much ketchup.

135
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,240
I don't think I slept more than six hours a night in Orlando.

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,160
Yeah. Yeah, I can go pretty hard.

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,200
I think the Chicago show we did, so we did Chicago and that was there

138
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,600
for three nights before Orlando.

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
And I cannot sleep very well in the house.

140
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
And I slept like a baby.

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,520
Jason, in my childhood bed where Mike slept as a baby in my crib.

142
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,640
Jason sleeping in my childhood crib.

143
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,760
Loved it. So I already was down.

144
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,040
I was already getting like five, six hours of solid sleep at night

145
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,000
then to Orlando. So I was I was slowing down.

146
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,760
But man, you never slowed down. It's crazy.

147
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,880
No, I it's like a I crisscrossed that property so many times.

148
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,360
You you had more steps like twice this.

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,800
We made a joke in the opening about how many steps everybody had

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,320
and we had everybody count their steps and yours were like 40 percent more.

151
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, I have it by miles, too.

152
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,600
I mean, the day we went to Universal, I walked 14.4 miles.

153
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,320
The day before that, I walked 11 at at Disney Springs.

154
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
No, I think you're also you're so happy there.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,960
I think that may have contributed to our little snafu where you told

156
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,240
we were at Cabana Bay and I was going to city walk to meet.

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,920
I fucked that up and I still feel awful.

158
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,880
I oh, I'm not saying it because I'm mad about it.

159
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm just like, you know, I was doing the walk thing because you just said,

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,760
oh, Cabana Bay to City Walk.

161
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,600
That's a quick little that's a 15 minute jaunty.

162
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Yes. And I did it in 15 minutes because I also knew the pain.

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,480
OK, so there's this pathway that connects all the hotels

164
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,200
and the theme parks at Universal or Lando.

165
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,640
And from Cabana Bay to City Walk, I told Scott it was 15 minutes,

166
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,600
not factoring that you were also wearing long pants and had a laptop bag.

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,600
And also that I did it around the same time.

168
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,320
The next or two days later when you did, I was like, oh, it is much muggier

169
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,960
than it is at seven a.m.

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,160
It was a lot muggier.

171
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,080
But I also think you were doing it like skipping because you're going

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,960
to see all your buddies. Yes, that's going to see Botanicus and Vin Diesel.

173
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,120
Yes. And the Hulk.

174
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,960
You were like Captain America and Winter Soldier when he keeps lapping

175
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,920
the Falcon, when he's rowed, they're jogging around the lake in D.C.

176
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,600
He's just like not.

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
He's just a fast man and he's barely winded.

178
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,040
I would say when I was doing I would describe it as what you describe

179
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,560
as a 15 minute John as a half hour slog.

180
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,120
But I truly think it was because you're like you just aren't even notice it.

181
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,560
You're just like, no, I am so happy.

182
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,160
I also I find just by the nature of them,

183
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,880
I find Universal Orlando more relaxing to Disney World

184
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,840
because there are less choices.

185
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,080
You know, it's a tyranny choice choice sort of thing.

186
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,360
Disney World, it's like, oh, you could have like a year and still their stuff.

187
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,120
You might not get done like

188
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,520
Universal Orlando much more like, you know, the parks all closed at 8 p.m.

189
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
and there's only two of them and you can walk to pretty much everything.

190
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,720
Yeah, I also feel like I is it possible that there are as many rides

191
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,480
in the two Universal parks as there are in all of Disney World?

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,240
It seems like they are. But they are right next to each other.

193
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,880
They are jammed together as opposed to like many, many bus rides apart.

194
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
And yes, if it slows you down.

195
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,640
Well, I think I also too,

196
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,160
because I feel like you guys had a lot more friction with the transportation.

197
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,560
Yes. In in I

198
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,800
I kind of lucked out most of the time.

199
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,720
And then a couple of times I was seeing how far I could push the infrastructure.

200
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Like I got on the last.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,640
What? You're banging on monorail

202
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,600
like girders to see if they collapse.

203
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,840
Like I got on one of the last buses at Hollywood Studios

204
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,080
to have two hours after it closed.

205
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,880
And I had just gotten off a boat from the boardwalk.

206
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,240
Like I was at the boardwalk.

207
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Do you mean you were just pushing your luck when it comes to time frames?

208
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Things would leave. Yes.

209
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
Yeah, it really made it seem like you were like demanding of the bus driver,

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,080
like, well, I wanted to see like how like how is stuff where I actually found

211
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,560
like for the most part overall, like stuff is running pretty well at Disney

212
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,280
World and and Universal in terms of rides, in terms of transportation.

213
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,720
After some of the stories you guys told me and, you know,

214
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
I waited a little while for some buses and like the Skyliner hours

215
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,280
were kind of frustrating.

216
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,520
That was the big vibe I got from other guests.

217
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,240
But the Skyliner, OK, we got all down on the Skyliner

218
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,200
because of the accident before or before we left.

219
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,840
I got to say now, Skyliner thumbs way up.

220
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,520
That's the most efficient system anywhere in Disney World.

221
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,680
Easy 12. Like from Scott and I were both that we can stay it now.

222
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,600
We we we do.

223
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,880
I had to say it now.

224
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,760
We can now we can reverse ourselves.

225
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
We are at the century.

226
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
I had to try to find us.

227
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,440
How dare you? How dare you?

228
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,720
But you can't do it anymore.

229
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,480
They had a you guys had police outside your doors just in case.

230
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,680
Well, I almost made a joke about it at like the you had material

231
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,280
related to pop century, but we didn't want to say.

232
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,440
Yeah, I didn't want to say.

233
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,720
So, yes, Scott and I both stayed at pop century.

234
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,280
And that that is like the start or end of line of the Skyliner.

235
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,640
And that to Epcot or Hollywood Studios is so fast.

236
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,160
Yes. Like even getting off at Caribbean Beach to change to

237
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,520
which park you're going to so fast.

238
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,800
So extremely pleasant.

239
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
And you hear like, wait, so I have to get out at the next stop and change.

240
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
How am I going to understand what that is?

241
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,400
You do it immediately.

242
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,120
It's so fast. It's so pleasant.

243
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,520
Sometimes you get trapped with like an annoying person, maybe.

244
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,480
But also there's like fun bonding between sometimes I got off a Skyliner car.

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,520
I was like, hey, good. Share a ride with you.

246
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,920
Yeah. And the very first night,

247
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,960
fantastic Epcot fireworks, the whole way back from the International Gateway.

248
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,520
Great place to see fireworks.

249
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,800
Yeah. Magic.

250
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,720
It really like creepy and odd at night.

251
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,640
Then I ended up taking just a solo Skyliner to over to Disney Studios

252
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,080
and really weird at night, like especially if you're in one of the ones

253
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,920
with like character overlays because it's all fuzzy.

254
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,920
You can barely see any shapes or lights around you.

255
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
It's kind of neat. Yeah.

256
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,320
And as well as I don't want to get too ahead, there was a situation

257
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,520
we had with transportation later where we got to see them all shut off

258
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,600
in the dark. That was weird, too.

259
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
They just hang there, right? Yeah.

260
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
They just hang. They don't like all go into a station.

261
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,320
They don't go into a station at all.

262
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,640
They just hang there at night when they're not working.

263
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,160
I guess I didn't know what else it would be, but boy, it's weird.

264
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,320
Yeah. It makes you feel like you're in a post-apocalyptic Disney world

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,640
where everything just like drop everything, bail.

266
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,640
We're never saving it. Run.

267
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Yeah. And Disney World in itself shuts down early.

268
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,840
Down to Disney Springs, not as much, but like everything does.

269
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,080
Eleven o'clock is everything's like done,

270
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,640
except for like a few places in hotels for the most part.

271
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,720
It's fine with me because truly I kept like, I kept.

272
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Well, yeah, like, hey, how about I have like a OK beer at the bar?

273
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,760
Pedals at Pop Century.

274
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,360
Watch really heartbreaking Astros game.

275
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,120
Sorry, Nick Mundy and go to bed.

276
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,280
But I'm not here to talk about entirely travel issues and sleep.

277
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,400
I like let's what's what's like big stuff that we hadn't done

278
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,760
or that we like needed to need to revisit.

279
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,840
Or I mean, for me, there was a ton I'd never done before.

280
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,360
Yeah. Well, Skyline, this is going to say like, I agree with everything you're saying.

281
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,160
If you have sort of a lot like a little fear of heights like I do,

282
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,400
it is a little anxiety inducing, but it is so fast.

283
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
As long as it goes smooth, everything's fine.

284
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,680
I was stopped.

285
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,640
I was late meeting you guys one day because I was hanging over

286
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,800
an access road for about five minutes.

287
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
See, that would have had it.

288
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,960
I wouldn't have liked it dangles a little.

289
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,480
And also takeoff gets up to speed.

290
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,880
Takeoff is almost like a launch and landing swings you real close.

291
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,120
You are head.

292
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,200
I was never on a car with other people where we didn't all yell

293
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,160
because you are just like careening towards the Skyliner bucket in front of you.

294
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,920
It's really like the end of original Star Tours is what it's like.

295
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,080
The first time you have it, have the first ride where you go into the station,

296
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,880
I think we all thought, oh, we're going to it's going to happen again.

297
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
It's happening right now.

298
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
And like we all sort of like, you know, that's what that really bonded us

299
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,080
because we all look at each other like, oh, OK, OK.

300
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,240
Well, we're on the next one.

301
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,760
We're on the next accident.

302
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,800
Get that toilet out. So I also I wrote it about

303
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,120
I'd estimate like six times only once was I ever in it with other people.

304
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,800
Most of the time, I got my own.

305
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,880
You asked for your own.

306
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,440
One time I asked, but then the other times I really didn't have to

307
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,560
because the crowd was not bad. Really?

308
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,000
Now, also, I got turned away twice at 1031 at different stations.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
So they were shutting it down hard at 10.

310
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,080
I watched it. We wrote it because we went from

311
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
was it Epcot to Hollywood Studios?

312
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,840
I think we connected somewhere.

313
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,640
I think we wrote it together once. OK.

314
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,120
I can't remember.

315
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,720
I didn't write it.

316
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,880
You switch benches.

317
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
That is a very unnerving feeling.

318
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
Do not try to do that.

319
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,280
Yeah, because you can rock like you could rock it yourself.

320
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,080
You could rock it.

321
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,640
The thing is so wobbly.

322
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,760
But I would just I would just like it if it was a little bit more stable,

323
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,280
if it felt a little more like a stable ride, but it feels wobbly,

324
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,480
which is what makes me the fear of heights kick in.

325
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,880
That's my only but I understand that that's not the.

326
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,480
Do you think it would be better or worse if there was like an incline?

327
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,360
Like if you were in a contraption like that going up a mountain.

328
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,920
What do you mean?

329
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Well, this because this is all flat.

330
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,440
Oh, I see what you're saying.

331
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,040
If I was going in a skyway or skyliner bucket, but it was up a mountain.

332
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,840
Yeah, like it might psychologically help me.

333
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,760
OK, it might. Yeah.

334
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,480
I see what you're saying, because when it goes way up high,

335
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,200
there's like a couple of different levels of height.

336
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,720
And when it goes up to the highest, that's when my anxiety kicks in.

337
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,680
Yeah. Whatever reason, when it's lower, they both be disastrous if they fell.

338
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,400
Yes. Yeah.

339
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,800
But for for whatever the higher the higher one is when I like

340
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,400
for whatever reason, I know there's no danger of it falling.

341
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,000
I know what you're feeling psychologically.

342
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,800
No, I'm not saying what you would in a Ferris wheel.

343
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,640
But yes, but it's like it shakes a little bit.

344
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,160
It's a little wobbly and you just psychologically, you know, nothing's under you.

345
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,680
That's all I mean. That's really what it is.

346
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,760
I mean, I think big, big criticism is they've got to expand those hours.

347
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,960
It seems like they're working on it.

348
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,360
But like, yeah, that's a different one of the times I ended up on a boat

349
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,800
because the Skyliner had closed.

350
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,600
There was clearly a lot of irate people on that boat

351
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,160
that they could not get on the skyline.

352
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,880
And the captain of the boat was sort of like, and folks,

353
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,120
if you're upset about the Skyliner, please let Disney know

354
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,120
that's the only way things change around here.

355
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,440
So Disney employees telling guests like complain to corporate

356
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,960
because that's the only way to me.

357
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,760
And a boatman. Yeah.

358
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,280
Yeah. I'm going to help you to complain to an old boatman.

359
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,720
Because if the park closes at 10 and you're in a line for something

360
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,760
and you get off at 1015 and takes 1050 minutes to get out of the park

361
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,840
and they shut it down hard at 1030, you got to find something else. Sure.

362
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,720
But I'm assuming it's just maintenance and other things.

363
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,160
They're making sure. I'm sure it'll be up to.

364
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
I think they're going to add it from what the people are saying.

365
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
They're going to add a ton of these.

366
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,560
They're going to be able to go everywhere with these.

367
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,080
They got to do it everywhere.

368
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,960
I want them between crisscross and between every hotel.

369
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm so pro Skyliner.

370
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,440
Yeah, I mean, it's easily the fastest thing anywhere.

371
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,440
If there was one that took you to Disney Springs, that's a game changer.

372
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,880
That's what they're talking about.

373
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
Next, maybe you can call that'll quarantine

374
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,280
drunk boomers off the buses because, man, some of those later

375
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,840
buses back from Disney Springs, people were hammered. Sure.

376
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,520
So let's yeah, let's talk about just because we did it

377
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,280
to my trip report a while ago where I was there and Jason's been.

378
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,240
But you're what were your let's ask you, Scott, what were your feelings now?

379
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
You haven't been there for so many years.

380
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,680
Now we've been doing this this fun little podcast for a while.

381
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,080
Was it was there anything that was surprising?

382
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,080
Was the feel of it different?

383
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,280
Were you surprised?

384
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,760
You mentioned the low amount of rides, which is, I think,

385
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,600
what I noticed the first time because Disneyland and California

386
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
adventure have packed rides.

387
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
It's they're packed in there.

388
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,520
There's biggie tickets like in each park.

389
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,880
And I think when I got to Disney World, I was like, oh, yeah, there's not like a ton.

390
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
I mean, there's a ton of stuff to do, but there's not as much.

391
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,440
Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,280
Well, you feel it the most in any park that where it's like the things

393
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,960
that we have essentially in Disneyland to where I because we had pretty

394
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,000
ended up having a pretty limited time in Magic Kingdom.

395
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,040
So I'm not doing their big thunder there, even though there's differences.

396
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,160
But sure, all those rides and they're fun to do.

397
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
I don't think I did their space mountain and

398
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,280
big observations, though.

399
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,640
I don't. Well, I also I'll be the Tokyo snob and say, like,

400
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,720
I think Tokyo is a more pleasant resort to be around,

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,800
to be in for an extended amount of time. Yeah.

402
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,200
The ease of that monorail loop and everything so packed in both of those

403
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,920
parts of Seoul, I mean, especially more way more so Disney.

404
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
See, but like.

405
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, Tokyo is kind of the best of both Disneyland and Disney World

406
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,760
because the resort area itself and the hotels are there's more obviously hotels

407
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,280
and the scenery is much more beautiful because you're by the ocean.

408
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,440
Yeah. But general pleasant.

409
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,600
It's two packed parks.

410
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,880
And obviously one is the most beautiful park in the whole galaxy.

411
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,960
But yeah. So yeah, it's also clean.

412
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,000
And but I also I can't throw it under the bus.

413
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,160
And then there I mean, I had a great time.

414
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,880
Could you you know, one of our early episodes was debating with Mike Mitchell.

415
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,440
What was better? Disneyland or Disney World?

416
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,200
Did you have any difference of opinion now after being there and being

417
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,080
still Disneyland? Got to go, Disneyland.

418
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,400
Yeah, it is still Disney. Yeah. Wow. You too.

419
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, I will say that.

420
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,760
Let me let me also say in the post, and this is not a surprising opinion

421
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
and not an opinion anyone would ever negate.

422
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,280
Universal Orlando is 25 times better than Universal Hollywood.

423
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

424
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah. There's just no competition.

425
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,600
It's so it's great.

426
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,880
I mean, and part of that charm is the way it expanded

427
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,040
similar to the way Disneyland expanded.

428
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,080
Second part is right next door.

429
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,200
Like, I believe this is that was like their idea is like, well, we can't.

430
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,000
We're kind of in the middle of the city.

431
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,080
We're buying this piece of property to build Universal Florida.

432
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,000
Our eyes on expansion.

433
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,760
We can't expand the way Disney World did,

434
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,040
but we can expand like the way Disneyland is eyeing.

435
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,760
And it happened 1999 California Adventure happens.

436
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,680
2000 was similar, like, you know, shopping district hotels,

437
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,720
that sort of expansion.

438
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,160
But it does. It's much more manageable.

439
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,040
It's so nice. Just like I think just a key difference.

440
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,440
Is that like Disneyland versus the Magic Kingdom?

441
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
It's just there's so much more.

442
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,760
And even our even Disneyland's weird

443
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,600
like Ghost Town Tomorrowland is still almost better than their tomorrow

444
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,240
than Magic Kingdom Tomorrowland, even though I mean, Tron's going to change

445
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,040
all that. Tron's gonna be great.

446
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,160
But we I think we have a better space man.

447
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,360
I love the oddities that they have carousel progress.

448
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Yes. And the people mover.

449
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,160
But I still and I really enjoyed that it's

450
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,800
it made me so happy to be back in 94 Buck Rogers.

451
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,040
Yeah. Tomorrowland.

452
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,320
I love that as a change very much.

453
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,640
But I don't know.

454
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
It's a big bump for Disneyland that we have the better space.

455
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,360
We want. Yeah.

456
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
I think just the jam packed nature of Disneyland versus

457
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,720
Magic Kingdom or the or Tokyo Disneyland, I think, just gives everything a bump.

458
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,640
And these properties can't help that.

459
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,800
There's like there's a ton to do and all the parts.

460
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,880
I would also not to go into a tangent here, but like I'll give Haunted Mansion.

461
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,920
I think I mentioned Florida's better.

462
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,000
I would agree with that.

463
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,120
Jason. Yeah, I'm trying to think.

464
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,960
I mean, those extra scenes at the start.

465
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,480
Yeah, a lot of it's that.

466
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,280
Yeah. And the end.

467
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,200
Yeah, sure. The ending now.

468
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
Love the Escher room. Absolutely.

469
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
I sure am very cool.

470
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,280
The ending is cool.

471
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,600
And all of that stuff is not plus ups that doesn't obviously like it

472
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
perfectly fits into the classicness of the Haunted Mansion,

473
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
which is very cool.

474
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,880
So, yeah, I don't disagree with that.

475
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,560
I'm torn on the house itself, the exteriors, which I like better.

476
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,240
Yeah, that's a tough one. Yeah.

477
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,320
I guess that might be a tie and I might just be a draw.

478
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,880
Yeah, that's two different kinds of haunted houses.

479
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
And they have better audio in the stretching room in Florida.

480
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,960
They have that cool new.

481
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,720
Oh, more stereo going. Yeah.

482
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,800
A couple of years ago, they added it in where it's like it kind of floats

483
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,560
around the room, the voice, and it's really cool.

484
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,880
Yes. Yeah. And they have not done it out here, I don't think.

485
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,280
Unless I'm not remembering now why they haven't done it.

486
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,040
Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,880
I did. I, of course, did do one thing that's a little different in Disney World.

488
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,040
The Liberty Bell Riverboat.

489
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,960
Oh, we didn't put that in.

490
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,080
Oh, how was that?

491
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,480
OK, so it was well, first off, it was inconvenient

492
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,120
because it departs every hour and half an hour.

493
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,960
And at Disneyland, the Mark Twain just departs whenever it comes back.

494
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,360
It's just continuously running.

495
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,600
But the river's bigger there.

496
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,120
And so it's a lot more spread out.

497
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,080
And I forgot that, like, you see other stuff like the, you know, the old guy

498
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,200
in Pirates of the Caribbean and Disneyland sitting like by the restaurant.

499
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,360
He's like sitting in his rocking chair.

500
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,000
He is on the rivers of America in like a weird little shack. Interesting.

501
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,120
The other big takeaway is that the co-pilot of the Liberty Bell

502
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,560
narration is a young man named Samuel Clemens.

503
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,000
And he tells you a fact about the riverboat.

504
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,800
And then he tells you a very pithy quote.

505
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,840
And it is shoehorned in.

506
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,600
It is there like banging out Mark Twain quotes while while going like

507
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,920
and this part of the river that buoy means this sort of thing.

508
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,160
I was born humble, but I've grown out of it.

509
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,920
Like it's just they're just not related, not attached to the fact.

510
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,280
They kind of so such a leap in the book.

511
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
In Disneyland, the boat is the Mark Twain.

512
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,240
It is the mark. Why are we here in Mark Twain and not the Mark Twain?

513
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,400
Is that a nod to the other one?

514
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,440
I think so. I think well, because he was a riverboat captain.

515
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,600
So his name is still Tom Sawyer Island.

516
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
Right. In Disney World.

517
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,560
So do you so I guess we're doing a lot of comparisons.

518
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,240
That's I don't really it's not fair.

519
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,760
I we like them both.

520
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,720
It's different. Oh, yeah.

521
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,880
I had a great time also in answering this question.

522
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,400
I don't know if I maybe I still have L.A.

523
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,800
bias, but I was I wouldn't describe my state ever as relaxed in Disney.

524
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,320
Perhaps at the Boat House.

525
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
We were we went away. Oh, yeah.

526
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,920
The Boat House. That was wonderful.

527
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,440
There were or oh, my God, California Grill.

528
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,880
I got a California grill in there.

529
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,720
We ended up at California Grill one night, too, which is really great.

530
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,600
Oh, my God.

531
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,640
Getting fireworks out there and the audio pumped in and the

532
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,880
I got to have the the wine that Kurt Russell made that's named after Goldie Hawn,

533
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,720
which I also had at Club 33.

534
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,120
I think I think that's high up on my list now.

535
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,400
I think the nature of our trip, we all sort of were in the same spot a lot,

536
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,000
which I think psychologically, at least for me,

537
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,680
I think that tires me out a little more to sort of be on a schedule.

538
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
A little bit more, which is exhausting.

539
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,840
So I do think that's part of why I was feeling a little tired as well,

540
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,640
just because like we we all had to be somewhere to get into the park

541
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,680
at the same time for various reasons.

542
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,400
So, like, oh, yeah.

543
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,160
And then as we all like splintered off and did our own thing,

544
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,480
because like I was I was never more relaxed.

545
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,560
And as I mentioned in the live show, seeing the Bahama and at Epcot,

546
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,800
I was alone. I abandoned the group.

547
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,240
Your trip highlight was just you and the Bahama.

548
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,080
I would say maybe highlight, but I'd be like, I'm in general.

549
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,160
I've never been more relaxed than like because I went from like, OK, fine.

550
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,560
Like I didn't have any sleep. We're on the plane.

551
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,000
We all have to get here at one time. We're doing it.

552
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,520
And then I was like, I took the Skyliner.

553
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,960
I was very stressed the whole time on the Skyliner.

554
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,760
And then I got to Epcot. Oh, yeah. I'm at Epcot.

555
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,560
I went to like get a drink by the American Pavilion.

556
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,800
And I just sat down and watched the Bahama.

557
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,400
And I was like, OK, everything's the finest.

558
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,960
My new favorite band.

559
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,840
And then I was like, all right, here we go.

560
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,560
Did I meet up with you after that? Yeah, yeah.

561
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,160
I had a piece of bread for you to give me a piece of cheese bread as I.

562
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,240
And you did seem much more relaxed.

563
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,800
I had had a very relaxing solo meal at Mama Melrose.

564
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,600
I had, of course, demolished a full pepperoni pizza myself.

565
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,440
Flates like for one for it wasn't huge.

566
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,480
But that that was my describe it as demolished.

567
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,640
I because I was so hungry at that point, because like I also would.

568
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,200
So I might.

569
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,840
I have like tips for people, but I a lot of mornings

570
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,880
just had like a Clif Bar and coffee on the run.

571
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,560
And that was also like that was kind of that was reliable.

572
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,480
And it was also like, oh, this is saving a little money on a meal. Yeah.

573
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,840
And then I can splurge a little more throughout the day.

574
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,840
You know, yeah, we can show that a lot more once we had cereal and stuff.

575
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,360
Yes. Yeah.

576
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,280
So I was like one day going to try to do like a breakfast buffet

577
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,480
or like get breakfast somewhere, but I just couldn't get up that.

578
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,520
I never did a sit down breakfast anywhere.

579
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,120
You know, my tip would be make sure if you if you want, if you want like items

580
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,520
and if you want like cereal and bananas and not insanely expensive

581
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,560
and water insanely expensive things,

582
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,440
if you want things in your room that aren't insanely expensive,

583
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,360
you have to do it on the way into the property because you end up trapped.

584
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,840
There's no supermarket.

585
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,040
There's nowhere to because you'll be guzzling four dollar

586
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,160
waters all week if you don't like prep for that.

587
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,920
So if you're lifting or something from the airport on the way,

588
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,160
the stock like stop somewhere or pop out real quick before you head into a park.

589
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,440
Also, you can get groceries to live Amazon.

590
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,600
You can do Amazon Prime now, which is what we did.

591
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,480
And there's also a number of Orlando's besides I think it's green grocer.

592
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,280
There's a few Orlando specific will deliver groceries to your

593
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,040
apartment. She more a little more expensive than Publix,

594
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,840
but certainly cheaper than Disney prices.

595
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,640
Yes. We got like three giant things of water delivered.

596
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,920
Oh, OK. Well, that's a very good tip.

597
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,200
I've never done any delivery of food from anywhere.

598
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I must be so in the past.

599
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,280
I've never I've never done a Postmates in life in life.

600
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,520
Never done it. You never had a pizza delivered?

601
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,400
No, that's but OK, but not like those services.

602
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
Not not. Yeah, not.

603
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm not doing a lot of app food delivery.

604
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,680
I've never I don't think I've ever ordered food on an app that's going to my house.

605
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,640
I mean, really? Yeah.

606
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,000
Don't do Postmates, I would say.

607
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Almost every time I've ever done Postmates, not good.

608
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,680
But like if you do whatever is it eat 24, is that gone?

609
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,720
And it's it's you know, that might be help.

610
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,960
Whatever that is, like that's more official and like you get every your food

611
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,640
like packaged, which I like better because like Postmates,

612
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,000
they'll just literally hand you an open Taco Bell bag.

613
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,320
So you're like, but do you what?

614
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,960
It like feels really like a haphazard.

615
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,160
It seems like it stresses out restaurants a lot. Oh, yeah.

616
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,040
Oh, yeah. They should not be getting that kind of pressure.

617
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
I did the high.

618
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,600
I brought a metal water bottle.

619
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,640
I didn't pay for water all week.

620
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
I just kept filling up this water bottle.

621
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,280
I think you're going to say a high jump.

622
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,360
No, do they call is this a hydro flask?

623
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,080
It's not the VSCO girl one.

624
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
It's like the swell kind of one.

625
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,840
That's a good tip. Yeah.

626
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,320
And some of the places that you find that was easy to get

627
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,520
fill up your water everywhere.

628
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,680
Well, they're starting to add more water bottle fill up stations.

629
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,040
But there was enough restaurants.

630
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,680
There was enough restaurants where I could get water from like,

631
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,000
yeah, a machine or something.

632
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,280
Only once, I think, that I did I filled up at a drinking fountain.

633
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,640
Well, we're talking about sustaining ourselves.

634
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,920
I'd like to talk about one one specific memory, which is a moment

635
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,440
where there was a divide between the group and Mike and Jason

636
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,960
way insisted on going on Living with the Land.

637
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,120
Oh, yeah. And Aaron, Lindsay and I refused.

638
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Not happening.

639
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
We'd rather than going on Living with the Land.

640
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,640
We chose to watch Lindsay eat cereal,

641
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,080
which I maintain was the correct decision.

642
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,280
I don't know. Mike and I, we had a great ride on living with the land.

643
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,920
I had a very good time.

644
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,080
It was a very good time.

645
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,240
You know, they had lots of little I really like this.

646
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,480
They had lots of little signs that said like, oh, this kind of,

647
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,840
you know, herb is used in the food festival at this stall in this dish.

648
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,280
Yes, I'm just fondly recalling the cereal again.

649
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,600
So it's just great to see Lindsay like, you know, fueling herself up,

650
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,120
feeling, feeling better.

651
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,520
Well, we were you missed out on advances in hydroponics.

652
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,640
We saw a person in a white lab coat doing something.

653
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,160
There was a lot of them this time. Yeah, there was.

654
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,080
They were all doing something. They were all doing something.

655
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I don't know what, but they were doing something.

656
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,520
We saw them. Jason, I saw them.

657
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,880
Because they're in there and lays down the lawn.

658
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,920
So we dry ended up getting her.

659
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,920
She got dragged on to a lot of stuff that she said was off the list.

660
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,520
Living with the land was the point of no return.

661
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,880
She was not doing living in the land.

662
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,680
I was pleased that Lindsay was in the same.

663
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,760
There was no weight. We did all do

664
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,960
the abomination journey into abomination.

665
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,880
Yes, I'm not going for that either.

666
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,000
At least it's you know, it's fast and there was a lot to like do

667
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,960
and talk about in that after that image works area.

668
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
What a weird atrocity of a. Oh, yeah, I designed.

669
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,560
I don't know if that a ride like they're still very rudimentary.

670
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,680
Email yourself the figment you designed.

671
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,040
Build a figment. You built a big, big, big man.

672
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Hittiest like big, big, big like him.

673
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,360
Like like something like it wouldn't let me go back.

674
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,840
It was I believe it was named.

675
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,640
I just came across in my photos, I believe.

676
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Yeah, because you couldn't reverse your errors.

677
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,760
Work and end up being named Iraq with an A.

678
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,720
E. A. Like in an email.

679
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,560
R. O. K.

680
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,440
And it was a jacked figment, a jacked yellow figment named Iraq.

681
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,320
It was that's good.

682
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,520
I mean, they're like, you're out of Iraq.

683
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,320
I mean, yeah, I like Iraq.

684
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,400
Iraq was probably one of the best examples of like the aesthetics are so insane.

685
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,560
There's no aesthetics.

686
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,360
The worst being the grounds of pop century.

687
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,200
Like, yeah, yeah.

688
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,640
Aaron declared that the most unpleasant,

689
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,160
aesthetically most aesthetically most unpleasant hotel she's ever stayed at.

690
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,440
But inside freshly redone rooms.

691
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,640
Yes, very functional rooms, very space economic.

692
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,600
Yes. Every time we we were like ready at every turn to like,

693
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,520
oh, but I bet they don't have they do have that.

694
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,000
There's a surface for everything.

695
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
There's plugs everywhere.

696
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
I do really.

697
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,960
So I would recommend the hotel.

698
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,080
And as I said, I like pedals.

699
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,920
The bar. Yes.

700
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,000
But yeah, it was all very when we checked in, we were like,

701
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,360
oh, this is a cruise ship.

702
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,680
We're in a stationary cruise.

703
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,960
Yeah, I mean, it's for families, for families who are running and gunning

704
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
at the parks. Now, if you are a solo traveler or like a couple,

705
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,800
an adult childless couple running and gunning at the parks, pop century.

706
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,920
Very convenient with that skyliner.

707
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,440
Now there's that skyliner as reinvigorated,

708
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,440
though tells that you might call more on the outskirts. Yes.

709
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,680
And I'm really glad I switched purely for Skyliner.

710
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
Read all the fastest mutes I had.

711
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,960
Yeah, all due to the Skyliner.

712
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,840
And we're a nice station.

713
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,040
It's kind of the end of the line.

714
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,720
And like you're going over.

715
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,480
I'm going to be the most beautiful part of the whole thing.

716
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,520
The big lake that, you know, we're heading up century and art of animation.

717
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Our glass lake. Oh, yes.

718
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
You're now heading over our glass lake.

719
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,080
I like those. I like that narration.

720
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,160
I like those little sounds.

721
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,280
The little star tours.

722
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,800
Are we use them on the show sometimes?

723
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,440
The ambient noise is very pleasing.

724
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Like I had found like on white noise, like YouTube white noise stuff.

725
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,640
There's like a 12 hour loop of the no stromo from alien.

726
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,960
And it's just kind of the hum of the spaceship.

727
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,320
And the Skyliner kind of has a similar sort of like hum as it's chugging along.

728
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,360
I'm working with somebody right now who is pumping into his headphones at all times,

729
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,840
like Star Trek, Spaceship Ambience Sounds.

730
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,640
I don't think I knew this was a thing.

731
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,720
Yeah, it sounds great. I like. Yeah.

732
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,760
I'm not sure what my I mean, I listen to like, you know, early 80s

733
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,640
people, mover, esk music all day.

734
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,880
And that's my version of it.

735
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,440
But that's a good this is a good area.

736
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,040
Everybody should do stuff like this. Yeah.

737
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,920
The strong but Nostromo is kind of creepy.

738
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,960
It is. I am. I was a little I had it on for like 30 minutes and I was like,

739
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,320
is someone about to get attacked? Is this a trick?

740
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,640
No, it was just a hum.

741
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,360
They'll be a little jump scare. Yeah.

742
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,600
Well, I was going to ask what your rooms, what were they closest to

743
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,000
in regards to like giant gaudy thing like what giant Play-Doh?

744
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,680
Well, I was by a giant.

745
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
Yes. I was.

746
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,760
I knew I don't think I knew where you were, Jason.

747
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,320
Oh, I was in the 80.

748
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,480
OK, we talked about this a little.

749
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,560
The numbering system at Pop Century is insane

750
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,600
because I was in the 80s wing, but I was in building seven.

751
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,120
Now, the 90s wing is building

752
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
eight and ten, but the 70s wing is building eight.

753
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,000
Like the numbers don't quite add up in my room.

754
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,200
My room number was seven, four, five, five.

755
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,360
Four means fourth floor.

756
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,400
Like there's all it's very weird.

757
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,840
And I was waiting for anybody who doesn't know any of this.

758
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,200
This is Pop Century is a hotel that is themed after decades.

759
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,880
Yeah, it's kind of like 50s through 90s.

760
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,200
So there's a bold, big iconography of each decade,

761
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
depending on which wing you're staying in.

762
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,160
So what you're saying is, yeah, the 50s aren't labeled five.

763
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,600
I would be nine and then the 90s are seven.

764
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
And it doesn't make any sense.

765
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,000
So when I went around the corner, I could see a giant Walkman.

766
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,160
And then I could see the smaller, quiet, quieter pool.

767
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,120
That had a giant laptop opened up to ABC News dot com

768
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,360
circa the 1990s on it.

769
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
A massive laptop.

770
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,720
Oh, and then a massive idol like statue of Roger Rabbit.

771
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,040
Yeah, because I'm looking at this right now.

772
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
This is a nightmare.

773
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,880
Whoa. Yeah.

774
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,120
Yes. You ever seen it?

775
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,480
No, I never seen this.

776
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
Wait, wait. You're talking about the laptop. Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Have you seen the laptop?

778
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,880
No, I spin it around. It's crazy.

779
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,440
It's a laptop. Yeah.

780
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,840
You know, I never I didn't make it over to there.

781
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,240
I didn't want to walk those grounds.

782
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,640
Where were you at? I was in the 50s.

783
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,960
I was over.

784
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,840
We had to pass by both Lady and the Tramp,

785
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
but we were in a wing that was a big jukebox.

786
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,160
And I remember because every time leaving my floor, they they wrote,

787
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,000
which I do like that they wrote the names of every like song

788
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,800
that the jukebox could play.

789
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,720
So they made up a bunch of 50s sounding songs,

790
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,160
include the one that was the nearest to the elevator that I saw over and over

791
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,040
was she got a color TV.

792
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,120
Now she never talks to me.

793
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,560
I saw that joke over and over again. Pretty good.

794
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,200
I also had to keep checking the text they had sent me to like,

795
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,840
what building and room am I in?

796
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,600
I'm usually very good at remembering my hotel room, but I could not.

797
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,720
OK, building seven floor four.

798
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,240
What is the number? Right. Confusing.

799
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,920
I also the whole thing was making me think, oh, in the like,

800
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,560
thank God that they stopped at the 90s, because if you built a hotel

801
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,240
based on the 2010s, then like the iconography

802
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,520
and the like the catchphrases would all be horrifying.

803
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,200
Yeah. Hashtag me, too.

804
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,040
Well, hey, the art of animation,

805
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,480
they simplified and they fixed it where it's just like you're in the lady

806
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,160
in the tramp building, you're in the cars building,

807
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,520
you're in the little mermaid building.

808
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,080
Then that was the one that was supposed to be like the pre 1950s.

809
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,560
So like there would be a giant monopoly board

810
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
pre 1950s popular culture.

811
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
You know, it's the other fun we got to have.

812
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,640
They when you're on the Disney buses, they theme the music

813
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,200
to whatever hotel you're coming from or going to.

814
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,240
So we got to hear great songs from different eras

815
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,320
like the Seinfeld theme, something no human being would ever do.

816
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,800
Just be like, you got to mix your driving and you're cruising in the car

817
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,680
and like, this is just a bunch of random songs I like.

818
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,400
Nobody recreationally listens to or like the Brady Bunch cheers.

819
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,560
I heard we.

820
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
Cheers, I could see listening to recreationally. Yeah.

821
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
Yeah. There's some extra verses.

822
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,400
Cheers. Yeah. Cheers. Pretty good song. Yeah.

823
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,200
Yeah, I'll give you this guy.

824
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,040
We were on the same bus to Animal Kingdom that one morning.

825
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,320
Oh, I was writing down some of it because one bus ride

826
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,120
because that's the other thing.

827
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Pop pop century is more eastern part of the property

828
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,480
and animal kingdom is more western.

829
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,800
And so this kind of longer bus ride, we heard

830
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,480
Rolling Stone, the Bob Dylan Rolling Stone,

831
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,880
like a rolling stone, like a rolling stone.

832
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,560
Then the cheer speed song.

833
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,960
Then diamonds are a girl's best friend.

834
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,200
Brady Bunch theme.

835
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,320
And of course, the Macarena.

836
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,680
Oh, yeah, that's right.

837
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,320
We were we were doing a lot.

838
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,400
Yeah, we had the Macarena in our head for like up until getting into Pandora.

839
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Yeah. Oh, which that's right, because we got off the bus

840
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,840
and I still had Bob Dylan in my head and I was like, like a great crone.

841
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,600
I had the Godfather theme on my way to Hollywood.

842
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,680
I heard whatever it is.

843
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,720
I don't remember. Universal, too.

844
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,840
I heard the guy every theme park is licensing the Godfather theme.

845
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,200
Yeah, because he just screams movie.

846
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,480
I guess, yeah, I know you would think it would be more of like a soaring

847
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,600
like the soundtrack to Soren's Q is always like soaring movie soundtracks.

848
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,320
But like the Godfather theme is kind of a little.

849
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,280
Yeah, a little tad ominous. Yeah.

850
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,920
I, you know, while we had just like a,

851
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,480
you know, like a silly, you know, like

852
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,560
made in mass pina colada kind of bar at that hotel,

853
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,800
we did have to make special trips to go to.

854
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,240
And now I realize we hit a bar at every one of the Magic Kingdom loop hotels.

855
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,840
And these were the highlights for me, if you can imagine.

856
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,600
Oh, yeah. California Grill with fireworks.

857
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,240
Hell, yes. Nice Disney fish, as in

858
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,200
Carthay Circle or Napa Rose.

859
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,640
Same goes in California.

860
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,680
If you if I'm having a nice glass of wine and a like a good fancy Disney fish.

861
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,600
Fish dinner. Yeah.

862
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,360
The Disney, the fancy Disney restaurants do great fish.

863
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,880
I'll tell you that whatever their sustainable catch of the day is.

864
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,800
You're never more chill than having that.

865
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,840
We had. Yeah, we went to I think it was the same night we had a loop.

866
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,680
We did Sam Trader Sam's. Yes.

867
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,800
We'll cover Trader Sam's soon.

868
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,720
More in depth and I'm glad I've done the other one.

869
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,760
But hell, yeah, that was a blast.

870
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,080
Great food there, too.

871
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,280
And that electrical boat parade broke out while we're sitting out there.

872
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,000
That was there were like two things that were just totally

873
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,600
out of my mind that I totally blanked on.

874
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,320
It was the boat parade and then in Islands of Adventure,

875
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,560
the Poseidon show.

876
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,600
Oh, yeah. And I just totally forgot they were there.

877
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,720
And I went back to Universal a second day.

878
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,600
I could have squeezed it in, but I just it was just burned out.

879
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,560
That was the one thing.

880
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,120
My brain was a little fried from going so hard.

881
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,360
So every now and then. Absolutely.

882
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,120
We did the what's I from forgetting the name, the Beauty and the Beast

883
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
themed bar at Grand Floridian.

884
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,600
Enchanted Rose. That's right.

885
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,240
Pretty new lounge on the second floor of Grand Floridian.

886
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,200
Yeah, we hung out with

887
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,400
as me and Aaron and you and Lindsay.

888
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,320
That was fantastic.

889
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,960
Jason was sprinting around.

890
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,480
No, that was center.

891
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,360
He was trying to do three laps of the world.

892
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,280
Showcase center then took the skyliner back to the hotel and took a nap.

893
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,680
That was like Tuesday.

894
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,560
And I was starting to crash.

895
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,480
Highlights or naps.

896
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,480
A lot of our content has been getting water and cereal.

897
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,840
All right, let's let me get the 30s Disney.

898
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,280
Let me hit a hard let me hit a hard opinion here.

899
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,240
People I've seen a lot of people say

900
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,560
Galaxy's Edge is a better transition in Hollywood studios than Disneyland.

901
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,680
Bullshit. Absolutely. No.

902
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,320
Why? No transition.

903
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,840
There's barely a transition.

904
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,120
It's fine. I don't hate it, but it's like a jarring like transition from

905
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,360
Toy Story into there makes no sense.

906
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Yeah, that is not they ran out of money.

907
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,960
It feels like that from Grand Avenue into

908
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,200
where the rise of the resistance is, that's at least a tunnel.

909
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,960
You're kind of you can see the split from the one stonework to the other.

910
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,360
Nothing compares to that critter country, that long way in

911
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,800
no long way out in Disneyland. Love it.

912
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,800
It's just exactly the same.

913
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,880
We didn't really spend much time. We didn't know.

914
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah, because I've been there a lot.

915
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,440
There's different colors we've seen.

916
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,560
You can Google the differences in colors.

917
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,520
We could talk about that. But why would we?

918
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,800
It's a little it's an audio medium.

919
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,160
So to talk about the colors is odd.

920
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,720
I'll talk about these colors, blue and green, the milk.

921
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,360
I had alcoholic green milk, which I was looking forward to trying.

922
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,240
I've said before, I feel like the flavor of the milks while I like the first six

923
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,480
sips, I feel like it gets a little punishing.

924
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,880
And I'm like, why am I consuming this if not to get a buzz?

925
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,720
So here I got to do it with alcohol.

926
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,480
Little disappointing because I saw the little it's like not blended as one thing.

927
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,440
They pour a little like half shot of was it tequila in the green one?

928
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,280
Tequila green, I think bourbon and blue. Is that right?

929
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,720
It I get a nice smell out of it.

930
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,600
Like you get you get a like, you know, fragrant margarita smell.

931
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,400
But I didn't feel much and it just felt separate.

932
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,520
The blend wasn't I don't know.

933
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,160
I don't I don't know that the alcohol does anything for me with the milks.

934
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,000
The trick, OK, the alcohol trick as far as not really a trick,

935
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,840
but Disney World and Disneyland, it's like the place actually have us.

936
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,760
Like you have to find the right places to have a drink.

937
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,240
Yeah, because most of them, they is what you're saying.

938
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,040
They're going to give you like a little bit of a pour in a big sugar drink,

939
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,200
which I like, but they're not in Vegas.

940
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,240
At least they're giving you more alcohol in it.

941
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,400
They're not they're really skimping out.

942
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,160
It's really wimpy.

943
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,400
And this is one of my big bones to pick.

944
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,200
The pores at the Food and Wine Festival.

945
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,400
Are you kidding me?

946
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,520
Or get the fuck out of your symbols for ounce.

947
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,160
I stood in a really long line and then got to the front of it and said,

948
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,240
saw three ounce. Never mind.

949
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,920
So I got in a different one.

950
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,960
Probably should have checked the sign before I got in line.

951
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,680
Much longer line. Really hot. Really human.

952
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,720
Get to the oh, I get an extra. I get one extra ounce.

953
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,640
I get four ounces. Yeah.

954
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,640
What is I was I I will say this.

955
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,040
I was severely disappointed by the Food and Wine Festival.

956
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,440
California, but you're way, way, way, way better.

957
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,000
Way better. How are those words? I'm sorry.

958
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,080
But are the pores bigger in California?

959
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,360
You get an actual you full glasses.

960
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,640
Yes, I believe so, unless I'm I can't remember.

961
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,360
But like, you know, I think everywhere is just giving you full beers.

962
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,320
So that's not a problem.

963
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,600
But I was looking forward to my my wine at the World Showcase

964
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,560
Lago during Food and Wine Festival.

965
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,560
So looking forward to this.

966
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,480
And then I ended up with this wimpy thimble.

967
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,240
It wasn't good, was not good wine. Yeah.

968
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,720
And that might lead me into this thing.

969
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,160
I don't want to take up too much time with this. But so.

970
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,800
Well, I'll say one of the highlights of the

971
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,640
of the entire trip and of the Food and Wine Festival,

972
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,360
our friend Doug Jones was down there with his girlfriend, Jessica.

973
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,480
And we got to hang out.

974
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,440
And he I don't think without him, I would have I don't think I would have made

975
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,040
a point of going to see Sheila E in the Eat to the Beat concert series.

976
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,640
Sheila E was fantastic.

977
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,800
Prince World, you love you love Prince as much as I do.

978
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,880
It was great to hear some.

979
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,240
She did like she did America.

980
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh, great, like deeper Prince song.

981
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,720
And hearing that in front of the American Adventure.

982
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,600
Yeah, it was very, very exciting.

983
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,360
That's is that got both of the big hits in and a bunch of like Prince jams

984
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,320
in the first half hour set.

985
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,280
That was a blast. That was fantastic.

986
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,880
But while on the way to that with Doug, he pointed out something to me.

987
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,280
He said, you OK,

988
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:56,400
have you noticed the sheer preponderance of Disney drinking shirts?

989
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,080
That's been in. I don't know if this is all the time

990
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,320
or if it's just during the Food and Wine Festival.

991
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,960
But basically Doug said, like, OK, I'm going to open your eyes.

992
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,800
You've been blind until now.

993
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,840
And you once you once I've told you this, you can't unsee it.

994
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,680
And truly, it felt like I was putting on.

995
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,040
I put on the they live glasses and I was seeing the world in a different way.

996
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,920
Because from the time Doug Doug told me that onward,

997
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,200
every sixth shirt I saw was some Disney wine bullshit

998
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,720
all in the like worst, curliest fonts I've ever seen.

999
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:35,960
And typically a group of like nine people all wearing these same shirts.

1000
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,160
Let me get through this quickly.

1001
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,840
I wrote ice from from that point on, I started just recording

1002
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,280
into a voice memo on my phone what all of these shirts consisted of.

1003
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,640
Usually a typical thing, glass of wine,

1004
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,000
like a character wig or hair or something up top and the curliest, most unreadable.

1005
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,680
You had to like really stare at it to be able to read the shirt.

1006
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,360
But let me let me just jump to these.

1007
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,400
These are all I saw within like an hour's time.

1008
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,080
Bibbidi Bobbidi booze.

1009
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,600
A whole the wine glasses with the hocus pocus characters hair up top.

1010
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,560
And it says drink up witches shining, shimmering, shit faced.

1011
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,680
She's yeah, I know we're not the part

1012
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,600
in a theme park environment, drunkest of them all.

1013
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,400
Sipping beauty, Walt's whiskey.

1014
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,040
It's just two words.

1015
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,760
I think beauty.

1016
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,240
You guys are OK with that one.

1017
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,520
We like deal.

1018
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,000
Tell me what you end up liking the most.

1019
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,720
I kind of like there's a few coming up.

1020
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,800
I like a bottle opens up a whole new world.

1021
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,960
Come on.

1022
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,760
Drinking around the world may not be the answer, but it's worth a shot.

1023
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,160
There's a shot.

1024
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,800
A lot of just drinking around the world.

1025
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
And I think that's where this all started.

1026
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,320
We're going to the Food and Wine Festival.

1027
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,040
It's World Showcase.

1028
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,480
We're going to drink in every continent.

1029
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,760
Sometimes there's a checklist on the back.

1030
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,520
Simple. Get it.

1031
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,440
But these are getting out of hand.

1032
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,520
Food and Wine Festival.

1033
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,320
People refer to drinking around the world because there's a bar in every

1034
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,120
multiple bars in most cases.

1035
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,440
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1036
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,200
And that's that seems like that's sort of what I wanted to do.

1037
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,320
But Food and Wine Festival almost makes it more difficult to do

1038
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,640
and to brave the line.

1039
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,160
And then it's just a thimble.

1040
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,120
I don't understand.

1041
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,880
California wins in this regard.

1042
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,200
Yeah. Fight me on it.

1043
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
I don't care.

1044
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,640
I just can't wait to be drunk.

1045
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,040
No one drinks like Gaston looks like a beauty drinks like a beast.

1046
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,440
Bibbidi Bobbidi drink till you drop it.

1047
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,240
What a leap.

1048
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,320
Yeah, a tad.

1049
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,600
Yeah. If you can't tie it together within one,

1050
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,800
you need a comma or a second sentence.

1051
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,400
Now we're jamming it together.

1052
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,840
Tear the paper off, crumple it up, start a new page in the legal pad.

1053
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,360
Come on.

1054
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,280
Tidying it. You should do it in the like tweet window

1055
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,240
to make sure that you're not going over 240 characters.

1056
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,160
Probably should be under like 60 characters, if we're being honest.

1057
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,160
Something with Ariel and says under the influence.

1058
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,360
Oh, get arrested.

1059
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,680
These are cry for help.

1060
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,360
And Ariel is a teenager.

1061
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,520
Ariel, yeah.

1062
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,720
Under the influence are most of these.

1063
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,080
Do they have the character on or is it just a saying?

1064
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,280
In some cases, it's just usually there's just like a

1065
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,560
because I think most of these are not made by Disney.

1066
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,680
No, none of I don't know.

1067
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,480
So I think it's it's just a semblance of character here

1068
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
that gives you the vibe.

1069
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Do you get it? I throw a bunch of these on our tea public.

1070
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,840
Maybe so we got to come up with like 20 right now on the air.

1071
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,080
Well, we should make them relate to like our, you know, our areas of interest.

1072
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah. I mean, like, I mean, I didn't see any duffy ones.

1073
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,080
Oh, my God.

1074
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,720
You figure out country bear ones like hit.

1075
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,840
It's like with paws like hit the paws, hit paws until I'm wasted.

1076
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,400
What do they say on this?

1077
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,040
That's good. That wonderful duff.

1078
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,920
Love that wonderful.

1079
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,000
Definitely. The Simpsons.

1080
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,280
Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah.

1081
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,720
Yeah. Well, it is a Disney owned property now.

1082
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,480
Oh, that's true. Yeah.

1083
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,360
Uh huh. The seven Duffy's. Uh huh.

1084
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,160
Uh, I was seven Duffy's is good.

1085
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,360
That's so good.

1086
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,400
OK, sippity doodah here for the beer because the kids aren't here.

1087
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,960
Which side note also, if you are, if you're if you're looking at shirts

1088
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,480
at the Epcot Food and Wine Festival and the shirts are not these wine puns,

1089
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,760
then they're about being tired of adulting.

1090
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,320
And I am tired of people being tired about adulting.

1091
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,640
Do you think any adulting shirts?

1092
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,480
We could maybe do a lot more business and t-shirt business

1093
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,040
if we just make 10 of these crank them out and crank them out

1094
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,600
and just put them in like bad cursive font on T public.

1095
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah. See who because people just buy them thinking like, oh, it's just.

1096
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,000
Well, turning our logo into the into papyrus into the avatar font,

1097
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,040
we're already like I am forcing Aaron, my wife and our graphic designer

1098
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,360
to go down some dark roads, maybe just in pursuit of commerce.

1099
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,080
We have to go down some even darker roads.

1100
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,800
I think we. Well, I think Disney is a month away from selling these kinds of shirts

1101
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,360
because on the shop, the shop Disney app, there are.

1102
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,520
I was like flipping through it one day and I was like, oh, that's kind of a nice shirt.

1103
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,880
And I was like, what is this slot that says must customize?

1104
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,920
And it's like the most tastefully designed shirts.

1105
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,720
Sometimes on the app, you have to put like the Sheridan family under the castle.

1106
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,760
So they're selling they're getting in on the bulk group shirt thing.

1107
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,000
They're not going to do booze shirts, though.

1108
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,520
They're too. Even though there's willingly selling booze to everyone,

1109
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,880
they're not going to like Michael.

1110
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,480
I think Bob Chapin is going to pull the trigger on this.

1111
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,560
It's so weird also, because like I think all of like we all just went.

1112
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,160
We were a group of adults who went to Disney together,

1113
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,840
probably with drinking among our top goals.

1114
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,080
And yet, can you imagine all of us coordinating the shirts?

1115
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,120
But we should do it next time.

1116
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,040
We didn't even get on the same like this guy and I, we were on the same

1117
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,760
the same flight, but that didn't even see each other.

1118
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,040
Yes. Yeah, I was.

1119
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,080
Sorry, I mean, worked out.

1120
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,720
And I think you were probably more towards once I was in the very back.

1121
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,040
For whatever reason, by the time I booked it, I could only get.

1122
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,600
We didn't even hold hands on the plane.

1123
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,360
We didn't even hold plans. Hands on the plane.

1124
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,800
I'm a couple of couple more really fast.

1125
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,440
Wait, wait, hold on. I have one big hero six pack.

1126
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,200
Oh, that's great. That's very good.

1127
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,120
Very good to go into. OK, like, what do I know the best, which is Rex?

1128
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,800
You could have Rex and it's and it says I've I'm writing these.

1129
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,080
I've always I've always wanted to get wasted.

1130
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,160
Yeah, that's good. What else does Rex say?

1131
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,160
That's his first time. Yeah, yeah.

1132
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,080
This might be your first time getting blackout drunk and it's mine, too.

1133
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,080
Wait, yeah. Oh, no, it's is this your first drink?

1134
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,400
It's mine, too.

1135
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,720
Like as if he like forgot he had a bunch of beers already.

1136
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,200
Oh, yeah. Where is the booze?

1137
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,960
Where is the booze?

1138
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,240
Booze, booze. Where is the booze?

1139
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,280
I'm going to go off the beaten path, even though this is one of my most reviled

1140
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,040
Disney things, the good Dino sauce.

1141
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,680
Jesus. I'll write it down.

1142
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,960
But it is a little. Yeah, yeah.

1143
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,600
You could do you know, we had a good time on Carousel of Progress.

1144
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,640
I like taking every Carousel of Progress quote, because there's one

1145
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,840
there's a thing that he says a lot.

1146
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,160
And maybe this there could be something about like, you know, my my my.

1147
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,720
Oh, you know, just or just him.

1148
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,840
I've been I've been trying to get sober.

1149
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,720
It'll never work.

1150
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,720
God.

1151
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,680
We got to have an uncle Orville reference

1152
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,920
because all of us obviously drying on the bathtub. Yeah.

1153
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,040
So oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1154
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,080
No, he says no privacy.

1155
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,120
No privacy at all around here or whatever.

1156
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,600
Yeah, no pina coladas around here at all.

1157
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,880
No, that doesn't work.

1158
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,160
And it's still pretty good.

1159
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,520
I asked on the way to that that you could take the people

1160
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,280
mover logo and turn it into the liver runer.

1161
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,560
So getting so bleak.

1162
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,000
And that's what I like.

1163
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,440
I like when they're about the darkness of drinking.

1164
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,960
Yeah, that's good.

1165
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,640
Yeah, so I'm trying to think of a good country bears.

1166
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,040
Oh, yeah.

1167
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,360
Uh, the country bears.

1168
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,000
The country bears.

1169
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,200
Yeah, it's a hoedown in my liver.

1170
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,040
Well, we're down in my liver.

1171
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,960
I think it's important right up as soon as I can get a drink.

1172
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:29,760
All right.

1173
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,560
I'll write it down.

1174
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,960
I'll get all the mean man.

1175
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,680
People like the I'll find a ladder.

1176
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,800
I'll be right up that.

1177
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,880
I'll let's let's in bright shoes.

1178
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,080
The country bears, I'll say, when we did it,

1179
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,280
the audience was hot.

1180
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
Was a good hug.

1181
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,040
It's true.

1182
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,000
I've been a bad audience.

1183
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
Influenced it in some way.

1184
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,600
And I hope you forget seeing in person how funny that show is.

1185
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,800
Yes, I went back and did it a second time right before I left.

1186
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,200
I was saying that people were jacked for.

1187
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,360
Yeah, people were there for it.

1188
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,840
It's leftover like body humor.

1189
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,000
Like you they wouldn't have made the show like that today.

1190
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,040
And they've cut some stuff from it.

1191
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,000
But also, like I have a full track, I think, on my phone, the full show on my phone,

1192
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,440
because you can get in the iTunes store, but

1193
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,600
you forget how goofy they look and just seeing them do it.

1194
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,840
People are laughing at how silly they look.

1195
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,240
Just the reveal of a big sad bear playing a tiny guitar.

1196
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,480
Yeah, just that gets.

1197
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,960
Yeah, it was getting laughs and not these like multi level were over it.

1198
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,720
And we found this new way to laugh at it.

1199
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,840
Like people are laughing the way they probably would have laughed at it in the 70s.

1200
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,120
Yeah, very genuine.

1201
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,720
Mark Davis designs very, very good.

1202
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,200
Just I remember the first time I had been on it, which reignited my love of it.

1203
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,720
It was like the Sunbana trio singing the guys that turn me on, turn me down.

1204
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,400
I mean, it's very funny.

1205
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,680
So three little bears.

1206
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1207
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,120
And that was getting huge laughs.

1208
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah, I think because I think a lot of people go into it forgetting and then are like

1209
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,480
because when you're you don't get all that stuff when you're a kid.

1210
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,880
That stuff goes over your head.

1211
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,760
But then like when you're bringing your kids, you're like, oh, yeah, this is funny.

1212
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,400
Every every drink I see goes right down.

1213
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,800
If we I think you'd have to have a picture of the bear on it, too.

1214
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,640
Yeah. Yeah. No, that seems important to trigger.

1215
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,120
OK. There's a great on the saddle.

1216
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,560
Booze all around at a great big puddle of booze on the ground.

1217
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,600
I'll just write that we can workshop that later.

1218
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,520
There's a great big beautiful hangover tomorrow.

1219
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,560
There's a great big beautiful.

1220
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,440
Yeah, so that's fine. Right.

1221
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,920
Yeah. Close enough.

1222
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,360
We're getting there.

1223
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,520
There's a great big beautiful tall boy tomorrow.

1224
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,280
It's very saying because it's a great big beautiful Tom Collins.

1225
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,200
Tom Collins.

1226
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,880
I was just trying to get shining at the end of every bar.

1227
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,800
It's shining at the end of every bar.

1228
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,120
That popular drink.

1229
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,440
We're going to clever with this. OK. Yeah.

1230
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,440
All right.

1231
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,480
Do you have more?

1232
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,640
I still have more.

1233
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,120
Because I ended with the craziest ones.

1234
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,320
Can you drink all the colors of the wine?

1235
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,160
Off to.

1236
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,160
I was going to say, yeah, what are the colors of the well?

1237
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,120
And that Disney added blue blue.

1238
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,800
But so now there.

1239
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,400
Yeah, you could drink four colors of wine potentially.

1240
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,200
It didn't.

1241
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,840
I don't understand this one.

1242
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,760
It's all the witches.

1243
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,360
It's like Maleficent and, you know,

1244
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,600
who else is Ursula or whatever?

1245
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,120
And then you can't sip with us.

1246
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,480
Oh, like you can't sit with us.

1247
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,120
Yeah. But the villains are just like kind of like, I think it's like,

1248
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,360
like clicky and catty. Yeah. Yeah.

1249
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,840
And then Dory the fish.

1250
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,040
I'm never I'm never drinking again.

1251
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,640
Oh, look, tequila.

1252
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,560
Oh, forgetful.

1253
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,800
That's why I was kind of trying to do that with the Rex one.

1254
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,120
Yeah.

1255
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,920
And character there.

1256
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,560
Can I hear the while we're still brainstorming, you just because you bought

1257
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,000
you bought that right.

1258
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,240
The chef figment.

1259
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,640
Or yeah, there is there.

1260
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,200
You got a little Funko chef figment specifically.

1261
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,120
So with one little spark, one, I mean, just one little shot, probably.

1262
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,960
One little shot. Yeah.

1263
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
That's the level of not going to clever with it.

1264
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,480
Yes. That's what I think. Yes.

1265
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,440
Yeah. We should just release 10 on the same day.

1266
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,280
I see what wins.

1267
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm not. Yeah. Not kidding at all about that.

1268
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,640
I think that should be.

1269
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,880
I see what the most popular one is. Yeah.

1270
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,800
And I think it's really not that hard.

1271
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,200
I think we can even just like type it up on the website.

1272
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,760
I don't think Aaron has to do anything.

1273
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,600
That would be, I think, preferable.

1274
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,400
I think we can just go on right.

1275
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,680
Find the worst font imaginable.

1276
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,360
Yeah. Just dump 10 of these on our site.

1277
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,360
And then she said maybe we'll pay a couple of dollars to promote them

1278
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,800
just in general.

1279
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,640
And we'll see what happens because this doesn't seem possible.

1280
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,280
That one of just one of these shirts, which is strangely like, oh, my God,

1281
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,560
we made sixty thousand dollars.

1282
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,920
That's what I'm getting at is that I think maybe we'll catch

1283
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,040
one of these will catch fire, maybe all of them,

1284
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,400
but one at least, I think.

1285
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,360
And it'll be like the most bought drinking Disney shirt.

1286
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,800
Yeah. Because I'm wearing one the next time the skyliner breaks down

1287
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,280
and you see a photo of them hanging hands on the glass.

1288
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,280
Oh, oh, oh, I just thought, oh, I thought of a great one.

1289
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,040
Nod your head. Blackouts coming.

1290
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,000
No, that's OK.

1291
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,760
Yeah, basically getting the universal rack.

1292
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,840
Yeah, I know. I think we got to bring universal in on it.

1293
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,960
I think we can for the rest of the episode, we certainly can throw these out.

1294
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,360
I don't think we have to stop them.

1295
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,600
No, no, no. Let's let's try. Yeah, yeah.

1296
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,480
I boy, I drink enough whiskey to fill Stephen Tyler's hat.

1297
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,240
That one's a little more niche.

1298
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,320
A lot of. Yeah.

1299
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,600
So I got to I got to hear that line.

1300
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,720
I got to experience that I was brave and I went on the roller coaster,

1301
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,120
which I did this in the live show.

1302
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,080
I listed what I went on not to recap,

1303
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,720
but I did a lot of stuff that I'd been afraid to do before.

1304
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,480
And I'm so glad I got in like launch fight and shape and drop fight and shape.

1305
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,960
Because some of these were crazy.

1306
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,520
I would call Rock and Roller Coaster the craziest launch and like a lot

1307
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,320
heavier, I'd say, than in credit coaster.

1308
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,360
Yeah. Is it how much faster? Do we know how much faster it is?

1309
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,080
I do think it's faster. It's faster.

1310
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,400
It's like a 10 mile per hour. Yeah.

1311
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,440
I mean, you can find the numbers online, but I think without my training

1312
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,600
in the last year, that would have been a much worse shock to the system.

1313
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,880
And I'm so glad I can do this. Did you do Hulk?

1314
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,800
Didn't do Hulk is the most intense.

1315
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,400
And also, I you guys did it. We did it.

1316
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,120
We got front row on the whole front row and I almost grayed out a little bit.

1317
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,000
Yeah. And I wrote it a few days later again.

1318
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,040
And I got tossed around and my head got bounced around the restraints

1319
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,920
a little more when I wrote it with you.

1320
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,840
I thought it was smoother,

1321
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,760
but I think it's aging.

1322
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,760
They redid it just a few years ago and it feels worse than it used to.

1323
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,120
I agree. I mean, I know my brain is rotting.

1324
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,640
I mean, we're getting older and, you know, we get some warnings

1325
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,080
from people about Hollywood, Rip Ride Rocket, which did break down.

1326
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,360
There was a little bit of news story about this even the day that we were there.

1327
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360
It broke down.

1328
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,960
And I think people were anxious to jump on it.

1329
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,640
It was a much bigger problem than it was.

1330
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,120
But I don't know.

1331
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,240
Like we got told for I don't want to say sources, but like the like

1332
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,520
maybe that one's showing its age.

1333
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,360
Maybe that's right.

1334
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,720
Maybe I might advise the audience to not.

1335
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,040
And then it broke down.

1336
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,440
I was going to do it because I haven't done it before.

1337
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,000
We're going to do it. It's a scary like climb.

1338
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,240
Now, apparently I've done it.

1339
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,760
Yeah, I wasn't wild about it.

1340
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,760
I didn't want and I liked picking a song.

1341
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,800
And the last time I was there, it's been too much time browsing.

1342
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,520
And they're like, all right, you get sabotaged by the Beastie Boys.

1343
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:50,920
Pretty good song.

1344
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,640
That's pretty good.

1345
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,680
It's pretty good. There's a secret menu to.

1346
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,000
Yeah, there as well.

1347
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,520
But you also have to pick that song when you are like 90 degrees straight up in the air.

1348
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,640
Like, oh, weird.

1349
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,640
That's all that you do.

1350
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,600
That's when you do that business on the way up and then it starts playing.

1351
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:11,080
I think as you drop, we did learn that that ride now there are great

1352
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,160
because like they got a lot of bad press when people are stuck on it for two hours.

1353
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,800
Now they put in different breaking systems

1354
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,440
where like they just very slowly bring it over the hump and down

1355
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,800
until it's like ground level and then get people off that way.

1356
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,160
Because people got stuck.

1357
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,680
Yeah. In the loop. Is that right?

1358
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,360
Like, no, no.

1359
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,160
On the lift. Oh, I see.

1360
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,160
So they made it so that can't happen anymore.

1361
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,120
Yeah. So they were stuck maybe for 25 minutes versus two hours.

1362
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, that's good.

1363
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,560
That's better. Yeah.

1364
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,480
It's in terms of scariest moment for me, probably

1365
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,560
Rock and Roller launch or all the backwards in the dark stuff in Everest

1366
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,960
was like more intense than what I usually do.

1367
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,560
Very cool. Loved it.

1368
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,640
And you got to do it now.

1369
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,120
This stuff. Do you go upside down in Everest?

1370
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,480
Am I wrong? In Everest?

1371
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,200
No, I think you when you go back, isn't there like kind of an upside down?

1372
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,480
Or am I not in restraints that would make you able to go up

1373
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,400
so unless they just keep you in a seatbelt.

1374
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,280
It's hard to tell what's happening to you.

1375
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,520
I guess that's what I because it's like on such an angle

1376
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,760
that it kind of feels like I'm having pressure on my neck,

1377
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,480
which feels like I'm doing a little loop.

1378
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,080
But I guess I'm not.

1379
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,760
The scary thing was going to be like going all the way up

1380
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,160
and then you're at the end of the track and like

1381
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,640
like something about that would be so precarious and scary.

1382
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,320
But it's not till that indoor spin around in the dark part.

1383
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,880
I'm glad I got a front row on Everest.

1384
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,840
I think it was back. I think it was maybe all the way back.

1385
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,920
We made that that part less scary.

1386
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,440
Yeah. You go backwards in a helix.

1387
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,600
OK, but you don't go upside down.

1388
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,640
Yeah, you don't go fully upside down, but it feels like it.

1389
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,520
You also, Scott, I gave you a lot of credit because in a one hour span,

1390
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,680
you did rock and roller coaster and Tower of Terror.

1391
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,040
You would have been impossible.

1392
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,840
I mean, yeah, it would have been possible.

1393
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,760
I mean, just because you didn't want to in the past, but also back in the day

1394
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,920
when those rides were newer, that would have been insane

1395
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,200
to get on either of those that quickly in the afternoon.

1396
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,120
Like you would have had much quicker, much longer recovery time.

1397
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,680
The dream corridor of the park to bang out.

1398
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,960
And as I snooze, new or Twilight Zone, I mean, we haven't done

1399
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,280
Tower of Terror proper, but so exciting to see that.

1400
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,640
That was so great.

1401
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,160
Lindy and I went back and rode that again. Oh, nice. One night.

1402
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,320
We had a there was a split.

1403
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,040
We decided we only had time to do because we can get on Slinky Dog

1404
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,640
right before closing.

1405
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,120
And we only had time to do one rock and roller coaster Tower of Terror.

1406
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,960
And I chose a rock and roller coaster over tower.

1407
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,080
Not nothing against Tower of Terror.

1408
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,400
I just need it. There's other there's an iteration of it.

1409
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,320
You could do. Yeah.

1410
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,600
Rock and roller coaster is only there and is not in Paris anymore.

1411
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,240
And as Lindsey pointed out on the on the drop itself,

1412
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,720
I'm a little spoiled now because of the Guardians.

1413
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,680
Everything about other than the drops on Tower of Terror is fantastic.

1414
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,480
Yeah. But the drop portion feels lacking now

1415
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,000
because Guardians of the Galaxy.

1416
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,240
Yeah. The dropping is less and it's quiet. It's quiet.

1417
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,640
There's no soundtrack.

1418
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,080
Yeah, I can see what would be less exciting at this point.

1419
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,280
So it's like the thrilling part of it.

1420
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,360
So that's so I was like, OK, what do I want to do?

1421
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,360
I want to get the thrill.

1422
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:23,520
Do I want to go and see Aerosmith play live after this rollercoaster?

1423
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,320
Or do I want to do a really great thing?

1424
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,920
But that's not as I have a drop, a better drop version in California.

1425
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,920
Sure. Sure. What ride did everybody do the most?

1426
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,960
That's a good question.

1427
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,320
I I didn't do a lot of things a ton.

1428
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,440
I didn't do a multiple.

1429
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,120
I did Rock and Rollercoaster twice. Yeah.

1430
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,640
I'm trying to think.

1431
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,640
Yeah. Would you or would you make a point to go back?

1432
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,800
Because I I would have fit in another one if I could have.

1433
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,760
But I was very pleased to do ET twice.

1434
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,840
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm glad because I was so excited.

1435
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,520
I was I was like a dog that wouldn't stop barking.

1436
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,440
The first time I did ET, I was talking and talking.

1437
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,480
And Aaron requested that we do it again in a more solemn

1438
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,720
manner where we actually take it in and it's a respectful experience.

1439
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,000
And I don't blame her.

1440
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,400
And I'm glad that we did because we in that version we got in the front row.

1441
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,360
So we were the first two names up.

1442
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,720
And sometimes clarity is an issue with ET.

1443
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,600
It was unmistakable.

1444
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,280
And I posted it to our Twitter account at ET.

1445
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,640
Goodbye. But hearing our names right after the goodbye.

1446
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,120
Goodbye, Aaron, Scott.

1447
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,240
Such a thrill. Yeah. So glad we got to do it.

1448
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,680
But my most rides title goes to Mexico Boat Ride.

1449
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,640
Oh, wow. I did three times.

1450
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,560
Wow. The second time was because there was that crazy thunderstorm in Epcot.

1451
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,080
And by that point, everywhere indoors was so fucking jammed.

1452
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,880
And every bench outside was wet.

1453
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,040
And it was truly like there is nowhere to sit.

1454
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,800
Wait, I know a chair we can get in right now.

1455
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,200
No problem. And that chair is on the Mexico Boat Ride,

1456
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,160
which I insist on calling it.

1457
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,520
I hate what a delight I.

1458
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,720
And, you know, in our little fascinations,

1459
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,200
you know, our fake rocks and our smells and things that we like.

1460
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,800
I want to add a couple of things to that list.

1461
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,680
Indoor fireworks.

1462
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,400
There's wonderful roof fireworks on that ride.

1463
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,200
And I think those are I think the shades of the Sinbad ride in Tokyo, too.

1464
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,400
And also, there's a couple of Epcot rides with these just very pleasant

1465
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,720
green painted on cityscapes.

1466
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,240
My Epcot green cities.

1467
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,920
God bless the Epcot green city.

1468
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,560
You know what I'm talking about? I know what you're talking about.

1469
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,400
Yeah, there's that.

1470
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,240
And it's it's in the Mexico Boat Ride.

1471
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,760
It's there's one in Spaceship Earth for sure.

1472
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,800
OK, it must have been in Horizons.

1473
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,920
I can only and I think I'm forgetting one even.

1474
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,880
Are you saying the mural on the outside of Spaceship Earth?

1475
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,880
No, in the rock in the ride, which is the progress city model

1476
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,400
on the people mover kind of like that kind of in that zone.

1477
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,560
Yeah. Oh, for some reason, I know you're so chilled out

1478
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,000
by these pleasant green cityscapes.

1479
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,120
I just want to like, you know, you mean sit and have a drink staring

1480
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,880
at one of those green cities for a while compared to our actual

1481
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,200
crumbling infrastructure in Los Angeles.

1482
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,520
Yes. Yeah.

1483
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,200
The dream of the actual great cities of the future.

1484
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,600
Jason, you're most frequented.

1485
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,960
Well, I wrote the people mover around.

1486
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,720
I got to do the like.

1487
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,320
So the day we did Magic Kingdom, a downpour happened.

1488
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,920
Yeah. Right after we saw took a picture with Sonia Clips and it's like, all right,

1489
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,680
let's continue walking.

1490
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,760
There's the rain.

1491
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,640
We got forcibly trapped.

1492
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,480
We got trapped in one of the best spots.

1493
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,760
You could get trapped right in front of Sonia Clips.

1494
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,000
So we had kind of a forced viewing of the entire Sonia Clips.

1495
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,800
Yeah. Which would have been more pleasant if it wasn't terrible rain

1496
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,360
and contemplating, are we going to have to eat the food in this place?

1497
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,160
Nightmare. And have to eat in cosmic race.

1498
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,800
You can dress up cosmic race to something good.

1499
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,240
But so I braided the ray.

1500
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,560
I ran to people mover.

1501
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,880
I had an umbrella.

1502
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,480
Unfortunately, the entrance to the people mover floods to ankle level.

1503
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,720
Oh, yeah. My shoes were very wet.

1504
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,040
Congrats. Yeah, I got it.

1505
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,360
And I got to get on a moving transit system.

1506
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,880
And so but everyone was just walking on.

1507
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,680
There wasn't a big wait.

1508
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,040
So as it came back in the station, like I asked, like,

1509
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,760
what's the easiest way for me to get back on?

1510
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,880
And they're just like, you want to go again?

1511
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
That's like, yes, I do.

1512
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,320
And they're like to stay in.

1513
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,320
Yeah. And so I got a second round of that.

1514
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,360
But I think I ended up doing

1515
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,040
Dr. Dooms fear fall a few times because it really I didn't know that because

1516
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,440
yeah, because I did it.

1517
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,080
Did I do it today?

1518
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,800
I did it, you know, a couple of times at night.

1519
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,760
The night we did universal because I the last few times I had been down,

1520
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,120
the parks closed early enough.

1521
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,240
It wasn't dark.

1522
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,200
And it's very cool to see the whole resort lit up at night.

1523
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,000
And then the Saturday I flew out.

1524
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,720
I was just there early enough.

1525
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,680
The Islands of Adventure had just opened.

1526
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,000
So I just walked on single rider a couple of times because you also see

1527
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,240
different angles of the city, depending on what side of the tower you sit on.

1528
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,640
And I went to the full queue, which is full of like Doom bots

1529
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,760
and Dr. Doom artifacts.

1530
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,920
And I've never done that.

1531
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,280
That does sound great. I should have done.

1532
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,400
I'm sorry. I left early.

1533
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,240
I went to the wrestling NXT show at full scale that night.

1534
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,120
So I bailed a little early and did not do horror nights.

1535
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,360
I apologize.

1536
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,600
I am still a so-called so-called king of haunts,

1537
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,600
but I did not conquer the Orlando Haunt.

1538
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,640
This is confusing. I mean, do you like haunts or not?

1539
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,480
Do you? Yeah, a lot of people have been asking me.

1540
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,880
And the answer is yes, I love haunts. I'm into haunts now.

1541
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,440
Yes, you didn't even do.

1542
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,480
I mean, you didn't even join me to get on Dudley Do-Right at 515

1543
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,640
as the sun is setting.

1544
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,760
The only cold day of the the only cold day we were down.

1545
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,680
And I immediately the first little baby drop got hit with three buckets of water.

1546
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,200
God, was it worth it?

1547
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,120
I mean, it's great. It's such a fun ride.

1548
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,080
I mean, it's yeah, I love it.

1549
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,280
But then you get to chill out a little later at the Hot Dog Hall of Fame.

1550
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,080
Oh, I did. Yes, you met me at the Hot Dog Hall of Fame.

1551
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,680
I was kind of insistent. I just saw it.

1552
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,000
I didn't know there was such a thing.

1553
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,760
And I'm like, you got it. You're coming here, right?

1554
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,320
You must. Yeah. I mean, it was a return visit.

1555
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,520
I've eaten there in the past. Oh, OK.

1556
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,120
Yeah, it's great. You can really load up those hot dogs.

1557
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,800
My hot dog was falling apart.

1558
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,360
I had some because where else you find that red onion sauce?

1559
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,080
Not on the East Coast, you know.

1560
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,840
I asked you during the live show, how many hot dogs total

1561
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,960
combined in Chicago and Orlando?

1562
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,920
And I just I just had the one.

1563
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,760
But there was the day that within 24 hours,

1564
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,920
I had had five scoops of ice cream. Right.

1565
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,040
Because so should I talk about?

1566
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,720
Well, let's talk about.

1567
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,440
So Mike and I, Monday night, we split off to go to Disney Springs

1568
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,440
to eat a chicken guy.

1569
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,080
Oh, yeah, this chicken guy really.

1570
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,720
That was a huge show at the live show.

1571
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,600
Yeah. Chicken guy is a newish restaurant in Disney Springs.

1572
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,880
Yes. Uh huh.

1573
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,040
It's a it's a phenomenon, I think.

1574
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,680
It is. Yeah. And I mean, it's the general.

1575
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,840
How is the chicken prepared?

1576
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,520
It's tenders are fried a sandwich. Yeah.

1577
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,640
It's fried chicken. It's not spicy chicken, although I don't know.

1578
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,280
Is there an option for that on the menu?

1579
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,440
Well, there's certainly spicy. Well, now,

1580
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,520
we're, of course, members of the sauce squad now. Yeah.

1581
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,560
So I signed up for the sauce squad ahead of time on my phone.

1582
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,560
Jason did not because he wanted the physical sauce squad card.

1583
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,600
But who would be the fool?

1584
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,200
I was the fool. Jason was the fool because they would not honor.

1585
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,840
So basically, you have to sign up online anyway.

1586
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,360
You get two free of.

1587
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,560
So whatever you order, maybe you get one or two free sauces with this.

1588
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,960
But if you're a sauce squad member, you get two additional free sauces.

1589
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,480
That's 50 cents a sauce. That's a dollar savings.

1590
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,280
That's a dollar. So if you're going a lot, which if we lived in Orlando,

1591
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,760
we would. Yeah. You're getting a lot of change.

1592
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,360
That's when you live in Orlando. Oh, there we go. Oh, believe me.

1593
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,080
It's any month.

1594
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,920
Aaron made Aaron pointed this out about both of you guys, but especially.

1595
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,560
She's like, Jason maybe just needs to pull the trigger.

1596
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,880
Maybe Jason needs to do.

1597
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,040
I don't disagree. So you were so happy.

1598
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,800
She saw a picture of you with the Vin Diesel wax figure on Instagram

1599
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,560
that you posted, and she's like, I don't think I've ever seen him happier.

1600
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,520
Salute, familiar.

1601
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,800
You could do comedy at SAC.

1602
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,240
I could. Yeah.

1603
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,600
I would make it less special, though.

1604
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,040
I don't know. Orlando is always a question.

1605
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,480
Well, did did make the Disneyland become less special living out here?

1606
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,680
I mean, even while that's hmm.

1607
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
Yeah, I don't know.

1608
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,240
Did Universal City become less special living sort of near it?

1609
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,600
And so, yeah. City walk become less special.

1610
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,040
That's a saga.

1611
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,480
I would argue, no. Yeah.

1612
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,800
I'd argue to only make it better.

1613
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,080
It's all more. Now there's stories.

1614
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,360
So we hallowed tales.

1615
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,520
We yeah. So we both had Chicken Guy.

1616
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,920
And this brings up an interesting thing to me, which the economics of Disney

1617
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,720
Springs, like you pointed out, it's really a big draw for the locals

1618
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,840
because like a chicken sandwich, a chicken guy is like six bucks.

1619
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:10,800
Really? Yes. At the hotel, a much worse chicken sandwich is like 13 bucks.

1620
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,600
Yeah.

1621
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,360
And they make all these sauces in how it was very good.

1622
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,760
I mean, at a certain point, we were talking about being excited for Chicken

1623
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,840
Guy because it was funny.

1624
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,080
And then once we're eating it, we're like, this is good.

1625
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,040
So much so that you went back.

1626
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:28,520
So we we after we ate there, we went back to Hollywood Studios to close

1627
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,920
to do Slinky Dog.

1628
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,200
But the next so the next day is the day that

1629
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,360
I had a drink at the Polynesian bar.

1630
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,160
You met me there outside of Ohana outside of Ohana. Yeah.

1631
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,720
Yeah. We have been at Animal Kingdom in the morning.

1632
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,800
And I think we all tapped out around lunch because that park heats up.

1633
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,440
Yeah, boy. That park is a pressure cooker.

1634
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,800
But if you rope drop it, you can get on flight of passage in under 15 minutes.

1635
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,880
Yeah, we didn't wait like it didn't wait at all.

1636
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,760
So I'll Tule Canteen. Also very good. Yeah.

1637
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,640
I was still there.

1638
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,080
I went to Rafiki's Planet Watch to pet a goat.

1639
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,640
I did the dinosaur ride and I did Expedition Everest,

1640
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,040
which as I was getting off that and heading to Saltuli Canteen to eat,

1641
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,240
you were like, do you I I am going to get a boat.

1642
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,680
Oh, yeah. I'm going to get a boat to go

1643
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,240
out on the seven sea list of lagoon in Bay Lake.

1644
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,800
And then you said that magic phrase, I'll pay for it if you want to meet me.

1645
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,000
Lindsay was going to go get a massage at the Grand Floridian.

1646
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,440
And I I had wanted to do this putt putt boat.

1647
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,840
I had heard so much.

1648
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,400
Like 45 bucks after an hour, I think.

1649
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,840
Well, I knew he was on the fence about it.

1650
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,200
And then I was like, well, I know it's about it. Yeah.

1651
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,160
But I was like, well, I got to get I because you famously have talked about

1652
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,760
like your family would do these boats and my.

1653
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,720
Honestly, we're very famous.

1654
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,840
You get stuffed on the street about the boat.

1655
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,360
But you mean you were like when you were a kid, your family on the boat.

1656
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,520
To me, because you were like, this was like an adventurous thing we did.

1657
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,400
And we were very safety minded.

1658
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,520
And my parents said they were your parents that are too dangerous.

1659
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,760
Well, no, my parents did it when they were young, newlyweds, like in the 70s.

1660
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,440
And my dad ran out of gas and.

1661
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,360
Oh, right. I'm.

1662
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,280
Washing up on a rocky jetty

1663
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,960
in the wake of like a transportation boat. Right.

1664
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,960
And then just kind of had to sit and wait for my mom to bring back help.

1665
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,320
And then he got swallowed by a crocodile,

1666
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,360
but then was able to like manipulate the crocodile body.

1667
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,160
So he like raised you from a crocodile's body.

1668
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,480
The rest of your child. Oh, yes, that's true.

1669
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,040
It's a huge news story because how did the crocodile get into Orlando?

1670
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,360
That's gator country.

1671
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,280
Oh, that's what I meant.

1672
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,360
But no, we took the boat out.

1673
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,120
We did some live streaming from the boat.

1674
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,560
It's very hard to see a phone screen in the Orlando sunlight.

1675
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,560
I was worried you were going to the phone was going to go flying into the water.

1676
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,600
Which would have been funny.

1677
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,640
It would have been good content.

1678
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,160
We could have talked about it.

1679
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:07,480
So this was my my most crisscrossing because after this, after the boat,

1680
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,520
I was a little worn out from the heat and the sun.

1681
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,080
There was a couple of things I wanted to do at Epcot again. I did.

1682
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,920
So I took the monorail to Epcot from the Polynesian.

1683
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,920
I went on Spatial Earth again because they're going to change it soon.

1684
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,200
I went and did test track, which is thankfully being refurbished in January

1685
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,960
because that ride was rough.

1686
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,880
That was not great.

1687
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,280
And then I had a nitrogen cooled chocolate truffle.

1688
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,120
This was like we did that same thing. Yeah, yeah, that was great.

1689
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,320
It was great. Like they scooped shot like like, you know,

1690
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,440
chocolate truffle into liquid nitrogen, made the outside hard as a rock

1691
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:51,280
and then smashed it with a hammer and you ate it with a fork and delicious.

1692
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,080
Maybe one of the best things I wasn't best meal, best treat,

1693
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,480
best drink you had whole trip.

1694
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Oh, I'll go first.

1695
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,720
Pizza at the California Grill.

1696
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,320
OK, really good. We just went up to the lounge.

1697
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,880
We didn't actually have reservations.

1698
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:10,360
That's a good tip, too, is because like you don't have to have reservations.

1699
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,440
You can just go you have to you have to go to a floor to check in for reservations.

1700
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,280
But you can just go there and go, is anyone in the lounge?

1701
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,040
Can we go in the lounge? And they'll say, yeah, sure.

1702
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,680
And they just take you upstairs.

1703
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,960
And then we had like really good pizza.

1704
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,960
Yeah, we did the sit down, but it's like, yeah, I did.

1705
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,280
I wasn't sure what the if the lounge was.

1706
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,720
You could still get into it last minute.

1707
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,960
So, yeah, I didn't know.

1708
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,040
Yeah, I didn't know at all until we just went and checked.

1709
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,640
The chicken guy was good.

1710
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,000
Chicken for me, too.

1711
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,440
So that was then I took this Skyliner from the Epcot back to All-Star,

1712
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,960
back to Pop Century, took a nap in the Murphy bed.

1713
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,520
OK, so this is a big thing.

1714
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:56,120
So what you can do is you can tell Disney, I don't need maid service every night.

1715
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,760
I didn't even tell them that I just ordered a standard room.

1716
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,680
Right. But I'm saying like, so this is a thing that basically I didn't realize.

1717
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,320
But you can get a ten dollar credit, a Disney credit or Disney gift

1718
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,040
card per night that you don't need the maid to come the next day.

1719
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,680
So we were at we went to All-Star Music.

1720
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,480
We were five days and they give you 40 bucks or whatever.

1721
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,560
So you were calculating this very specific thing

1722
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,240
that if you didn't do it and you didn't have maid service,

1723
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,960
that there was a Murphy bed and a regular bed.

1724
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,880
And you were excited because since you weren't staying the whole time,

1725
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,920
you could sleep on both of them and they would both be fresh beds,

1726
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,240
which you really like.

1727
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,840
So I didn't end up doing that because I was so tired the one night.

1728
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,720
I didn't want to pull down the Murphy bed.

1729
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,040
But when I went to take a nap, I was like, all right, I'll try the Murphy bed.

1730
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,520
It's a but it's not as good as the regular bed.

1731
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,960
It was identical to the it was like the same mattress.

1732
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,800
It was the same mat and all your pillows are on the regular bed anyway.

1733
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,360
Same pillows, same sheets.

1734
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,560
Total cash for total profit on this.

1735
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,080
What did I got?

1736
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,560
Because I did it. I did it.

1737
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,880
Probably got 20 dollars.

1738
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,080
Now I got like 30 bucks.

1739
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,000
OK, how many nights were you there?

1740
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,360
Which certainly could not have gone towards a boat. No.

1741
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,640
He offered.

1742
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,640
So I took the nap.

1743
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,000
I woke up. I'm like, what do I have time to do?

1744
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,720
What I was going to do that I didn't I was going to take the Skyliner

1745
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,720
as close as I could get to Disney Springs, then take a bus to Disney Springs.

1746
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,720
Why are you doing all of these?

1747
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:29,800
Because it's fun, because I like the skyliner to the Skyliner

1748
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,000
to the car back to the minivan.

1749
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,280
And I wanted to see how everything was running.

1750
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,840
I want to see how the theme park journalists to try and stuff out.

1751
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,160
I need to pack in infrastructure tests.

1752
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,400
Yeah, so I ended up doing the more rational.

1753
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,280
I took the bus to Disney Springs.

1754
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,320
I ate at Chicken Guy a second night in a row.

1755
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,760
By that point, my sauce squad membership had been verified.

1756
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,680
You got your free to my free to sauces.

1757
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,960
Are you going there primarily to finally cash in on your sauce squad status?

1758
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,360
Uh, no.

1759
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,920
Well, I was also doing some souvenir shopping.

1760
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,840
Disney World is down 50 cents, too, for free.

1761
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,160
So that's another that's another dollar.

1762
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah, yeah. Boy, you're so and sensor climbing up.

1763
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,400
So now the clock is ticking.

1764
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,880
I had Chicken Guy and I wanted to get to the boardwalk

1765
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,360
to go to Ample Hills before they closed so I could eat overlooking

1766
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,800
their lovely body of water.

1767
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,800
I got the buses were taking a little while.

1768
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,440
I got on the boardwalk bus with some very drunk boomers

1769
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,640
who were screaming about like the Toto song Africa.

1770
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,360
They don't think it makes.

1771
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,800
It doesn't make any sense.

1772
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,480
Who's blessing the rains in Africa?

1773
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,800
Oh, well, fuck them. Yeah.

1774
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,440
Get the fuck out of your assholes.

1775
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,600
Hammered. I got to the boardwalk,

1776
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,320
got into Ample Hills like three minutes before it closed.

1777
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:08,760
And then they said the magical words, Sir, would you like any complimentary topics?

1778
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,080
So they're giving you hot fudge and whipped cream for free.

1779
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,040
So I had a little something.

1780
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,040
And now you whipped cream for free.

1781
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,000
I had the hot dog.

1782
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,080
I had the exclusively flavor Sally sells seashells,

1783
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,880
which is a mandarin orange with chocolate pieces in it.

1784
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,040
Delicious. OK, we'll see what flavors of every so.

1785
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:33,200
So that was so that was the Sally sells seashells and ooey gooey butter cake.

1786
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,920
Right. Signature flavor, of course.

1787
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:40,120
The next day at Diagon Alley at Fourlean Fortescue's Waffle Cone.

1788
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,240
I think I did going off the dome and not one note.

1789
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,760
Yeah, no, it doesn't need it.

1790
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,040
It was Apple crumble and Earl Grey in his head.

1791
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,240
And then that night I went to Hard Rock to Emack and Bolio's

1792
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,000
and complicated names.

1793
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,160
You just got it.

1794
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,920
And had it was like a super it was like triple.

1795
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,040
It was like super dark chocolate ice cream with chocolate chunks

1796
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,720
and brownie chunks in it was a special name.

1797
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,400
I don't remember. I don't maybe.

1798
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,760
And that is a triple something midnight something or blackout something.

1799
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,400
Wow. So and then I.

1800
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,080
Oh, OK. So then how do you get back from the boardwalk to pop century?

1801
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,840
Hotel to hotel. So very difficult in Disney world.

1802
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,160
So I'm like, do I go? I think others lifts, by the way.

1803
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,920
That's it. It gets expensive. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1804
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,280
Yeah. So I always had that out, but I wanted to see if I could do it for free.

1805
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,160
So friendship boats still running, took the friendship boat from the boardwalk

1806
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:41,760
to the closed Hollywood studios, got on the last bus.

1807
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,520
When it's the end of the night, they just line the buses up in a row.

1808
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,520
They don't even do the stations anymore.

1809
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,960
I got on that like one of the last buses out like Saigon.

1810
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,480
I got on one of the last trips out and got back to pop century

1811
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,640
because I had to go to bed because I checked out the next morning

1812
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,760
and moved over to Cabana Bay Universal, which I thought was great,

1813
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,080
which is a great hotel for all of like the design and sanity of pop century.

1814
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:14,040
The like modernist architecture of the bay looks really nice.

1815
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:18,760
Granted, only like three years old, but better aesthetics, much better aesthetics.

1816
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,360
Great service.

1817
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:25,000
A lot of restaurants and bars in that one for like a value, moderate, like

1818
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,800
floor to ceiling windows in my room.

1819
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,400
Like, yeah, very, very nice.

1820
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,640
But to answer your question, top heats.

1821
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,000
Nitro truffle was a highlight.

1822
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,080
Chicken guy.

1823
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,640
Boathouse was very good.

1824
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,080
That's good. Yeah.

1825
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,600
I saw Tully Canteen.

1826
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,560
You were in the.

1827
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,440
I was really. Yeah, I liked it.

1828
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,040
Yeah, you did.

1829
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,920
I just did. But I dug it.

1830
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,520
You're going to start.

1831
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,880
Aaron did like a combo that struck out a little bit.

1832
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,800
And I'm quite right.

1833
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,240
But I had this like garlic noodle shrimp thing was very good.

1834
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,880
Yeah. And mythos mythos.

1835
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,800
We got those. We got the big table.

1836
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,200
We got the VIP table and mythos, which if you anyone recalls,

1837
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:08,160
factored into our fake rock Final Four, we got to eat in like it's the restaurant

1838
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,160
and now it's an adventure that is fake rocks on the inside and outside.

1839
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,480
We get to dine inside fake rocks.

1840
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,240
Delightful. Yeah. Walked in pretty much.

1841
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,760
Yeah. We're seated almost immediately.

1842
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,880
A very food is good there.

1843
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,720
Food was good.

1844
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,000
Menu was very like interesting options

1845
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,480
about the same price as like the three broomsticks.

1846
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,400
So like I know there's a joke of like,

1847
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:37,120
oh, they have the best theme park food banner hanging for like 20 years or something.

1848
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,120
But mythos was good.

1849
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1850
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,440
Mythos was good. I was thinking, I think I said at the table,

1851
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,040
if we started giving out, you know, we're an authority in the theme

1852
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:50,080
park journalism community and the theme park entertainment world.

1853
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,720
If we started handing out awards to things, would they have to post it?

1854
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:59,440
Like if we also gave mythos some sort of no, but keep going.

1855
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,360
I'm just saying maybe I mean, I guess you're right.

1856
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,680
They wouldn't have showed.

1857
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,000
But should they? Could they? Would they?

1858
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,760
Because what was the authority that's giving mythos the top?

1859
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,680
Yeah, that was weird.

1860
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,640
Yeah. What's that?

1861
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,720
Park insider.

1862
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:17,080
There's a banner outside of mythos in a theme park, which is odd

1863
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,840
because you don't see this anywhere in Disney and more than other.

1864
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:26,160
I don't see the name of a newspaper or a website saying come into here.

1865
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,360
It's not like a movie or not seen as agates review.

1866
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,600
It's weird. Yeah.

1867
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,200
Did the old banner say Attractions magazine?

1868
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,000
I don't know. There's a couple.

1869
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It has. It has always been well reviewed.

1870
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,840
Sure. I'm just saying, you know, we have a lot of say now.

1871
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,360
We have a lot of poll like let's award mythos something.

1872
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:49,640
Let's award other universal restaurants things and see if we can get a banner.

1873
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,080
We'll maybe make the.

1874
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,440
OK, so let's say we ate.

1875
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:00,720
We at podcast, the ride ate at mythos and mythos is a meal fit for a king.

1876
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,040
That's great. Right.

1877
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,840
Put it on your put it on a banner.

1878
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,760
Yeah. Retributed to podcast the ride.

1879
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,360
Zeus himself, king of the gods, comes down to enjoy a lamb burger.

1880
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,560
That's right.

1881
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,480
So there'll be a banner now, hopefully soon hanging under the one from theme

1882
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,120
park insider. Yeah.

1883
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,120
That's you know, we're endorsing mythos.

1884
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,360
We want name placement. Yeah.

1885
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,720
The Islands of Adventure.

1886
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,960
Can I tell us a quick story stemming from what you said, Jason,

1887
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,240
a little bit ago about boomers?

1888
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,960
Yeah. A fun boomer encounter.

1889
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:39,360
As I talked about in the live show, hell of a American adventure.

1890
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,360
Had a great time. Great to see the Zuck in there on the week.

1891
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,880
He was getting grilled.

1892
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,240
Is it just getting his dick grilled by AOC?

1893
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,560
He's really fantastic.

1894
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,200
So we are leaving the American adventure.

1895
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,000
And there was this quote that was in general,

1896
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,080
the American adventure is very strange to watch now that we're coming to the end

1897
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,720
of the American adventure.

1898
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,440
And there's like there's a lot of like quotes and moments

1899
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,760
where you just kind of get this weird little shiver like, OK,

1900
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,880
but never more than at the end where this is actually I think it's

1901
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,000
I don't remember if it's Franklin or Twain,

1902
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,360
but one of them is actually quoting John Steinbeck

1903
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:22,480
saying how America now faces the danger,

1904
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,040
which has been the most destructive to humans.

1905
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,080
Success, plenty, comfort and ever increasing leisure.

1906
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,640
No dynamic people has ever survived these dangers.

1907
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,200
So on the way out, I was kind of quoting that

1908
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:43,800
and saying in that voice, yes, no great society has survived leisure,

1909
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,240
which is why these millennials need to get off their asses and get a job.

1910
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,240
That's just a bit I'm doing for you guys.

1911
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,200
And then several feet ahead of us, a woman turns around

1912
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:01,920
and gives us the biggest hammiest thumbs up and like, yes,

1913
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:06,200
like the hugest face of somebody said it.

1914
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,080
Somebody said it in public.

1915
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,600
Thank you.

1916
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,520
Somebody I would I would call this person a boomer probably.

1917
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,760
And and then she turned back to her husband and they kept walking.

1918
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,240
And then they turned back and stared at us again because she did some mental math.

1919
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,000
Wait a minute.

1920
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,200
These not olds who say this millennial quote, these are youngs was

1921
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,920
do I detect sarcasm?

1922
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,240
And they didn't know how to process.

1923
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,200
I think they realized maybe they'd been had.

1924
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,160
That would happen.

1925
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,360
I think so. I think they did a double take.

1926
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,200
Like I thought I would turn and hear that quote coming from a

1927
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,000
60 something.

1928
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,600
Yes.

1929
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,000
Yeah.

1930
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,400
Yeah.

1931
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,400
A man with a franklin impersonator.

1932
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,800
Did they then say like right about the leisure?

1933
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,440
Yes. And the husband added, I think he did the math of, oh,

1934
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,200
maybe that was sarcasm or something.

1935
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,120
It was sort of awkward.

1936
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,040
And then like, well, you're right about the leisure.

1937
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,840
I'll tell you that.

1938
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,960
And I my head when I heard that, I wanted to go like,

1939
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,600
motherfucker, you're here on vacation.

1940
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,200
We're all on Disney World.

1941
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,000
We're working.

1942
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,520
Hey, we're all at Disney World.

1943
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,560
Yeah, we're working.

1944
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,480
Work like with with our self made podcast.

1945
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,160
Yeah, we were built from the ground up.

1946
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,960
We figured out a revenue source for ourselves.

1947
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:24,360
Yeah.

1948
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,560
You know, Hollywood's all IP now.

1949
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,040
You sure?

1950
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,680
Where are the ones we're making original crafty?

1951
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,960
Yeah. But I just like it's like, what are you complaining about?

1952
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,880
It's the world like you're on vacation, too.

1953
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:36,720
You're on.

1954
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,720
You're doing leisure.

1955
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,600
I just don't understand why you guys don't go out and get a

1956
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,840
four hundred thousand dollar a year job.

1957
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,000
Get to it. Start applying.

1958
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,880
Just show up. Just show up and say, I'm ready to work.

1959
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,760
This was a big reminder that we are in Florida.

1960
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,240
That we are. This is Florida.

1961
01:31:55,240 --> 01:32:00,200
We cannot maybe go around yelling shit like that as we would in California.

1962
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,640
And we could be, you know, like I just realized, OK, so keep Trump comments

1963
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,080
in your pocket. Got it. Get it. Good. Yeah.

1964
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,560
Aaron reminded us of this as we went into the Hall of Presidents.

1965
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,080
You know, I remember.

1966
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,800
Remember where we are. Florida.

1967
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,320
Best behavior, everybody.

1968
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:20,520
Understandably, because there's a lot to snicker about in the Hall of Presidents.

1969
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,120
So two guards, there's two security guards in there.

1970
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,560
I believe there's more.

1971
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,880
We were only one the first time I went.

1972
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,760
I think we're all like tongues bleeding from biting like everyone.

1973
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,320
I know our friends from SAC, who are with the people from said

1974
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:39,000
a couple locals with us.

1975
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,400
And they were like dying.

1976
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,720
They're like holding themselves together, like cracking up.

1977
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we're like, can't do it.

1978
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,280
I don't want another American adventure thing.

1979
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,800
And then Trump starts talking.

1980
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,800
I hear a boo. Somebody else. Not in our group.

1981
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,040
So at least I at least we didn't add to it.

1982
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,840
But like and a child started crying when Trump started talking.

1983
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,400
A child had to be escorted out of the room.

1984
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:05,560
He boy, I mean, we'll do Hall of Presidents eventually, but in person.

1985
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,560
Holy shit. So spastic.

1986
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,080
The most spastic animatronic I've ever seen.

1987
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1988
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,200
And this is before the we're in a week where he's been booed multiple times.

1989
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,440
Just seems to be like

1990
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,520
getting off on it at this point, keeps going to public sporting events.

1991
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:24,920
Yeah, getting ripped.

1992
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,000
He might well, as as Trump Jr.

1993
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,080
said, like, well, you know, if you're going booted at city,

1994
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,360
that means you're doing something right.

1995
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:35,040
Like within the city, you're from motherfucker.

1996
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,320
But also also like President Bloodsport, like, yeah,

1997
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,880
I love when the president goes to UFC events like that's

1998
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,840
really funny. OK, they're. Yeah.

1999
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,720
Because that was a surprise.

2000
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,320
I think Trump is going to a dog fight.

2001
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,920
President Trump attends cockfight.

2002
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,960
I find my good friend, Michael Vick, I finance.

2003
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,840
He's starting it up again.

2004
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,800
And he had a good name. Great dogs.

2005
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,040
He gets booed there by the eight people that are there.

2006
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,680
I like dogs now.

2007
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:11,080
I know I say things people die like some dogs are like,

2008
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,840
yeah, we got to do these dogs are hard workers.

2009
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,000
Maybe when the may be right before the election,

2010
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,080
we do Hall of Presidents proper episode.

2011
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,960
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

2012
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,760
The year from now, we'll do it right before we finally escape

2013
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,360
the scourge forever, assuming he's not impeached before.

2014
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,280
Oh, no, I'm sure he'll be impeached.

2015
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,720
Absolutely. It might be irrelevant by the time this episode comes out.

2016
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,880
So we got to be careful.

2017
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,680
And then the sun rises on all of our structural issues solved.

2018
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,000
Once he's gone, everything then everything's back to normal.

2019
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,200
Everything's back to perfect.

2020
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,080
The way it was perfect years ago anyway.

2021
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,240
Before we I'm sure there's a lot of other stuff to say,

2022
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:53,760
but the other big story to tell in this is a transportation issue

2023
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,120
because Jason, you had very good luck with transportation.

2024
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,440
I had very good luck.

2025
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,600
Is this the after the show? Yes. Yeah.

2026
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:06,720
Yeah. So after the show, I grabbed a lift back to Cabana Bay.

2027
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,280
My my driver was a little chatty.

2028
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,360
And I was like, oh, this will be funny.

2029
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,840
I'll talk about my my the next morning when I see the guys.

2030
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,040
I'll be like, oh, and a chatty lift driver.

2031
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,520
She told me about a family and stuff. Isn't that fun?

2032
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,640
I thought it'd be very, you know, we're all waking up.

2033
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,360
This will be some small talk.

2034
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,560
You guys went on an adventure of the life.

2035
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,240
A wild ride beyond what Mr. Toad could dream of.

2036
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,600
So people who are listening to this may have been talking to us

2037
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,000
outside of that comedy lab.

2038
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,040
It was great to meet everyone and talk to everyone.

2039
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:41,320
As soon as whoever the last of you was left, there was no post show party.

2040
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,600
We all left.

2041
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,680
We called a lift and went to go to bed as soon as we possibly could.

2042
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,320
We were very tired.

2043
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,680
SAC is like downtown Orlando, which I'd never been to before.

2044
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:54,880
Yes. And it is party like college party central down there.

2045
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,880
We had fucking motorcycles during our show.

2046
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,720
Yeah, we were revving motorcycles throughout the whole show,

2047
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,200
which we first saw with thunder.

2048
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,360
And then people like, no, there was motorcycles.

2049
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,520
Yeah, yeah. Like a gang of motorcycle motorcycle gangs.

2050
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,560
Someone told us about that, that it's like, oh, yeah,

2051
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,840
there's not a lot of places to ride in Orlando.

2052
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,000
So everyone with motorcycles just to does it downtown.

2053
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:21,480
They do loops around the comedy theater, the comedy theater with great sound,

2054
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:25,200
probably the best sound in an improv theater I've ever seen.

2055
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:29,720
So we so we call it lift.

2056
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,680
It's pretty much further than yours because we had to go all the way back

2057
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,680
to Disney World.

2058
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,920
It's it's it's me and my wife, Baron.

2059
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:41,000
It's Mike and Lindsay and a really fun ride.

2060
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,400
Guy was great.

2061
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,520
One of like one of my just personality wise favorite lift drivers ever.

2062
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,040
He told a really funny story about like getting into a coffin and escape room

2063
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,040
to try to look cool in front of his wife.

2064
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,520
He is scared.

2065
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,240
And he was trying to not hit the panic button.

2066
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,120
And he's in there for 30 seconds like panic button, panic button.

2067
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,600
He talked about managing a Chili's for like 15 years.

2068
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,120
Yeah. But he loved Chili's as well.

2069
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,200
You could because he's like, oh, you're making me nostalgic.

2070
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:10,000
Oh, yeah. And I sort of talk about how I love Chili's excited into the Chili's

2071
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,280
alone at full outside of Full Sail University the night before.

2072
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,520
After the NXT show, you're bonding over your love of Chili's.

2073
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,920
It's a really fun ride.

2074
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,440
He even says like this one is one of the fun rides I've had.

2075
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,160
You guys are great.

2076
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:28,360
And then then we get off the freeway and get into the Disney World area.

2077
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:32,040
It was going to be, I think, us first at pop century and you guys at All-Star.

2078
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,640
And then we hit a road closure.

2079
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,840
No big deal. That should reroute you.

2080
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,760
That should be. It's because it's like 1230 at night at this point in time.

2081
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:45,040
When Disneyland is we care, Disney World, as we keep saying,

2082
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,080
things generally shut down like 10, 11 buses stop running.

2083
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:53,160
So they're like, this is a fine time to do some road work.

2084
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,400
It becomes clear after a few passes of, OK, let's reroute.

2085
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,320
Wait, where are we now? Let's reroute again.

2086
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,040
We're back here again. Wait.

2087
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:06,080
And now the app is saying make a U-turn in two miles.

2088
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,520
Like we just keep going back and forth and we are nowhere near anywhere we need to be.

2089
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:15,080
This is clearly the crucial artery of the entire property.

2090
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,520
This is like Osceola Road.

2091
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,440
It's like at least that's my view of it,

2092
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,640
because this shutting down caused the entire thing to go to shit.

2093
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,120
We could not.

2094
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:29,280
The driver could not figure out how the hell to get any of us to our hotels.

2095
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:33,400
We ended up in the Hollywood studio, the empty Hollywood studios parking lot.

2096
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:37,920
We got routed through the well, we got routed through the main parking garage

2097
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,240
where there were no attendants and almost no one around.

2098
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:45,520
And just one other confused, weird car kind of like tooling through the lot.

2099
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,840
Totally empty.

2100
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,640
We looked to one side, as you said earlier, the skyliner totally dark

2101
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,480
as if it had been abandoned post-apocalypse.

2102
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:57,400
The one of the only lights around were the side of the lights on the Hollywood

2103
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,880
Tower of Terror. Yes. Very creepy.

2104
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:04,240
And we're like, Lyft wants or the whatever Waze wants us to go here.

2105
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,560
This doesn't make sense.

2106
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:08,040
We loop around, just go back the way we came.

2107
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,760
We get on some other thing. It says detour. We get off the road.

2108
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,720
Now we're in the other side.

2109
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,720
After 10 minutes, we're in the other side.

2110
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,840
We go through an employee entrance of the Disney studios.

2111
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,640
We're just right next to the wall where Rise of the Resistance is.

2112
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,520
Yes. If we and no one's around, if we'd hopped the wall,

2113
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,240
maybe we could have been partying with 100 stormtroopers.

2114
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,680
Yes. Like, again, why is the program telling us this?

2115
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:37,960
You can see there's a few stray cars being led on the exact same wrong path.

2116
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,800
Yes. And they're confused.

2117
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,160
And you feel it.

2118
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:46,120
You feel cars really hesitant, like the body language of every car you see is

2119
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,880
like, what?

2120
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,880
And the driver is starting to we're we're just all starting to snap and talk about,

2121
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,720
well, our new life is here.

2122
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,800
We live together in this car now.

2123
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:01,480
And it's clear that whatever is routing the driver is not doing us any good.

2124
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,920
So I think you pull out your phone to help.

2125
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:08,200
We again don't do the right thing.

2126
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,800
Maybe I can help.

2127
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:14,280
Maybe Lindsay can help. We end up all with there are four phones,

2128
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:18,760
all with different apps showing different ways to get around the property.

2129
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,120
Because it doesn't know that things are shut down.

2130
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,920
Not everything has the same information.

2131
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:28,520
So I also I got to say, like because I have I in my head, I could kind of picture this.

2132
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,320
So here's Hollywood Studios and here's pop century over here.

2133
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:35,440
They're close ish, but they're not close.

2134
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,080
No. And I find it very I don't know where the hell

2135
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,760
I am on the property. Yeah, it's.

2136
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,720
And I'm a theme park podcaster.

2137
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,120
Yeah. And you have to think if people are getting in late

2138
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,800
or coming back late from restaurants or bars.

2139
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:54,360
Pop Century, I asked at the front desk over 2000 rooms in that complex.

2140
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:00,920
If you factor in all of the all stars have over a thousand, some of them over 2000.

2141
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:07,200
That is tons of people to to do this level of insane road closure.

2142
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,280
Yes. And in and all the hotels, by the way,

2143
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,880
we kept having issues when we were first booking very full this time of year.

2144
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,320
People coming in for Halloween parties.

2145
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,760
Populated places on earth.

2146
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,880
How can this be happening?

2147
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,640
How can this be our only option?

2148
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:22,960
Four phones are out.

2149
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,440
Sometimes the driver makes a move and we go, that's not on mine.

2150
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,960
Let's try it anyway.

2151
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,480
And then it still doesn't work.

2152
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,680
There is no solve to this.

2153
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,600
We are in a giant escape room.

2154
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,960
As the driver told us his nightmare.

2155
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,520
It's like we're trapped in the coffin.

2156
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,560
He was avoiding in his story from earlier.

2157
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,800
He had he had said this had happened to him once or twice before.

2158
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,320
Yeah. And then we thought I was kept thinking, oh, that's crazy.

2159
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,520
Obviously, it's not going to happen to us again.

2160
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,600
And then it did.

2161
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:56,080
And then I had the thought that, OK, maybe if we switch where we're going,

2162
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:59,480
maybe if we go all star music, you guys are first.

2163
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,080
And I don't know if I'm also like subconsciously, my brain was like,

2164
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,960
let's try to get you out of here first.

2165
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:04,600
Like, I don't know.

2166
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,160
But I think logically, it made sense to break us out of whatever bad.

2167
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,000
We're all this is a war room now.

2168
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,440
And all of us, you say that.

2169
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:14,520
And then we're all like, yes, break us out of the pattern.

2170
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,360
Yes, the driver is like, oh, yes, we're in a pattern.

2171
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:17,200
Break us out of the pattern.

2172
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:19,120
That's a two to three mile difference.

2173
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,200
Again, not a huge amount of difference.

2174
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,880
But we're like the room in Apollo 13 that's trying to figure out

2175
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,600
how to put the square peg in the rest.

2176
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,840
There's to fit in there.

2177
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:31,560
So, OK, I was thinking, OK, maybe that gets us out of the loop.

2178
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,080
Then it'll it'll give you a different straight shot to pop century.

2179
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,840
So we do that.

2180
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,960
And I'm navigating on my phone and I'm basically just telling the driver

2181
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,440
what to do. So I'm saying, no, don't go because he goes,

2182
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,960
if you want to go right here, I go, no, no, no, not right here.

2183
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,520
No, no, no, dear.

2184
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,920
It's a stay here in the straight.

2185
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,880
And then you're going to go right after this next.

2186
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,720
OK, all right, we got it.

2187
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,560
So we got there.

2188
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,640
We get to all star.

2189
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,240
Yes. Music eventually.

2190
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,000
It takes a little while, but we make it in.

2191
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,480
And let me say using the policy, where if you're taking

2192
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,360
a lift around one of somebody just passes up their magic band.

2193
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,360
They can. Oh, you're staying here. Great.

2194
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,920
Let us in. Yes. For later.

2195
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,640
So they were taken up to the lobby.

2196
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,240
There is no issue. Right.

2197
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,760
Everything is fine. We'll tell you how it goes.

2198
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,160
We said, OK, hopefully everything's going to go fine.

2199
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,160
We went in. We went to bed.

2200
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:22,480
This was the now by this point of longish commute

2201
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,160
and then a lot of funny business on Disney World.

2202
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:27,280
This has gotten us up to the 40 minute mark,

2203
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,560
which should have been about a 25 minute commute. Yes.

2204
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:35,760
Aaron and I, an extra 20, 20 more minutes added onto this.

2205
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,320
We leave where you guys are.

2206
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,920
We end up in the same exact place.

2207
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,160
We keep going. You turn in two miles.

2208
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,440
What the fuck are you talking about?

2209
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,320
We're by something called Gaylord Palms.

2210
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,920
We're so far off property.

2211
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,360
We are screaming now.

2212
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,320
And then he's telling us like, I've done this with like

2213
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,160
this happened to me once with children in the car where a mother is going,

2214
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,360
please, you have to get us to the hotel.

2215
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,440
They're crying.

2216
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,760
And he's like, I don't know.

2217
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:58,960
I don't know how to help you.

2218
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,080
And we're turning into those crying children.

2219
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,480
We have been in this car for so fucking long.

2220
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:08,080
The driver incredibly stopped the meter where you guys were.

2221
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,960
All right. Said this is so ridiculous.

2222
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,160
I can't charge you for this.

2223
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,760
Very nice. Great driver.

2224
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,320
One of the best I've never looked like to driver so much.

2225
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,840
And he does keep saying, guys, I've I've made a turn on this.

2226
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,680
I'm loving this. I'm having fun now.

2227
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,880
I want to get you guys home.

2228
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,560
But like, oh, my God.

2229
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,920
So so more U-turns, more back and forth.

2230
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,040
And then we hit a breaking point.

2231
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:35,800
We see a Disney security vehicle on the side of the road.

2232
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,720
The guy starts flashing his lights really aggressively to get his attention.

2233
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,200
We pull over.

2234
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,800
The windows roll down.

2235
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,640
The air and I and the driver all are like, where is the.

2236
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,520
Just screaming at this guy.

2237
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,240
And he's just like, OK, hang on one at a time.

2238
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,360
One at a time. What's going on?

2239
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,240
The road closures have prevented us that we don't know.

2240
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,080
We don't know where we are.

2241
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,560
We don't know how do we drive forever.

2242
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,640
Here, follow me.

2243
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,120
So now we are driving now.

2244
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,040
It's one in the morning.

2245
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:05,760
We are driving through the Disney World property with a security escort.

2246
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,160
Which you have to admit in hindsight now is something that everybody doesn't get

2247
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:11,160
to do. Yeah, it was neat.

2248
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,760
We're trailing a car.

2249
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:13,880
It's pretty cool.

2250
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,880
And he proceeds to go away.

2251
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:20,040
That is none of the directions we had gone any of those prior attempts.

2252
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,160
We never saw one part of the road that this guy took us.

2253
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,760
So clearly you have to be in a Disney World employee expert

2254
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,760
to know how the hell to navigate that property around this time.

2255
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,360
So minutes are passing.

2256
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,440
It's still it's the longest, most circuitous route.

2257
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,720
As I said, all told, 20 extra minutes just for Aaron and I.

2258
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:41,160
Then we get to security at Pop Century.

2259
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,160
They stop us. OK, ID.

2260
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,080
Oh, yes, of course, we hand up our magic.

2261
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,480
No, no, no, ID.

2262
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:51,160
Oh, OK, that hasn't happened before in 10 trips to this hotel.

2263
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,200
Why hand up my ID?

2264
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,200
Secure is the hotel security guy.

2265
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,240
No, no, no. You.

2266
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,600
Really aggressively at the driver.

2267
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,560
And he's like, what are you talking about?

2268
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,360
Me? You mean my ID?

2269
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,520
Yeah, I come in and out of these hotels all day, every day.

2270
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,600
This is never having me. New policy, new policy for you.

2271
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,520
This, my friends, is racial profile.

2272
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:17,080
Yeah, this is some fucking profiling shit at one in the morning in the heat.

2273
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,280
After a great hour in the car.

2274
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,560
Now we are experiencing profiling.

2275
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,600
The driver takes it in stride.

2276
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,200
He's he does it because it's just like,

2277
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,560
what are you going to find that is a problem?

2278
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,760
What is the end?

2279
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,480
And right before we before the gate opens, he he drives.

2280
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,000
He's like, I'm reporting you to your boss.

2281
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,520
I'm reporting you to Mickey.

2282
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,600
That's great. Love that. Great.

2283
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,400
We finally get to the front door.

2284
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,800
And at this point, we give the guy we just hand him cash.

2285
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,120
This is for you. Thank you for everything.

2286
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,600
And we got to get a picture.

2287
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:52,600
I've never taken a picture with the driver before.

2288
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,560
And he's like, oh, of course, man, you guys are the best.

2289
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,760
Big smiles. Great photo.

2290
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,520
In a in a theme park vacation where every employee is friendly

2291
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,360
and trying to do go above and beyond.

2292
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,600
This driver was the number one,

2293
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,320
the best navigated us through a situation where we needed a security

2294
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:15,840
escort. Insane, insane.

2295
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,160
This was so fucking boggers.

2296
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:21,520
Yeah, that was I mean, up until we didn't we didn't have the last 20 minutes,

2297
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,720
but up and it was the most memorable.

2298
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:25,160
Yeah, already. Interaction.

2299
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,040
It was already when we're laughing.

2300
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,480
We are. It is a fun ride, I will say.

2301
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,400
It was fun.

2302
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,640
I kind of feeling we would drop you guys off and like, there's no way we're just

2303
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,760
back at the hotel. This is going to keep going.

2304
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,840
Yeah, I probably yeah, I guess it was sort of a dream

2305
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,920
that it would like fix itself just by going out of the way.

2306
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,280
But yeah, the whole thing, of course, takes a dark racist turn toward the end,

2307
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,040
which I obviously do not care for.

2308
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,360
Yeah, man. Yeah.

2309
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,760
At the end of all that, that should happen.

2310
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,440
New policy for you is really aggressive.

2311
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:00,360
Yeah. So thumbs up to this driver for taking it all in stride, for being it.

2312
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:03,720
So maybe my best ride of the trip, this lift ride.

2313
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,920
Wow. Yeah.

2314
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:08,440
I mean, it was very fun because sometimes the driver even more fun.

2315
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,760
Who drives your vehicle and rises resistance?

2316
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:12,360
Who's that little guy? I don't know.

2317
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,560
I forget what the name of that droid is.

2318
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,120
Nimnub or something.

2319
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,160
Isn't that? Oh, no, no, no, no.

2320
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,680
No, no. Pilots, the first part.

2321
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,760
Spoiler alert. Sorry.

2322
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:22,840
Rise of the resistance.

2323
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,640
Well, this driver is better than nine.

2324
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,840
No, that's fair. You can imagine.

2325
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:32,680
I yeah, we honestly, I mean, you have a lot of I like.

2326
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,480
For some reason, there's something fun about the Lyft drivers in Orlando

2327
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,720
that they're I don't know.

2328
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,800
They're like a lot of like ex employees.

2329
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:44,360
Yeah, there's always you get like a real fun character,

2330
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,760
like a fun character driving you around.

2331
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,640
It was a blast. And he was the best.

2332
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,800
Yeah. Imagine how bad that could have been with a driver.

2333
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,600
You like didn't get along or they were just being silent with initially.

2334
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,800
I had the night before because I came back from full sail to the parks.

2335
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,600
There was a lady who was just like, I was like, oh, she's like, how are you?

2336
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,800
Not going. I go, it's fine.

2337
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,800
I go, how's yours? And she goes,

2338
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,040
it's going. And I was like, oh, no.

2339
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,240
Here you go. And then we put we didn't talk.

2340
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,920
And then I felt bad about not talking.

2341
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,160
And then I like, yeah.

2342
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,200
So it was the much.

2343
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,240
Can be grim. Imagine navigating that insane scenario.

2344
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,360
With it with a grim driver. Yeah.

2345
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:25,840
This guy wasn't that I buy a great bartenders, too.

2346
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,880
Although the bartender at the bar outside of Ohana was great

2347
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:33,000
at Cabana Bay, there's a lobby bar.

2348
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,920
And Friday after I left, you go, when I went back after I left the Magic Kingdom,

2349
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:41,040
like the guy was I sat down and I would urge a beer.

2350
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,720
And he's like, hey, it's a minute past, but I'll give you happy hour prices.

2351
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,840
And I'm like, holy shit. Happy hour to theme park.

2352
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,680
Like, you know, like a theme park property.

2353
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,400
You never see that coffee the morning of the live show.

2354
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,400
We get just a free thing.

2355
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,600
That's great. Incredible.

2356
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,520
We went to Abracadabra.

2357
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,560
I'm just trying to get some of the really cool

2358
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:04,280
some of the last islands to I just popped into the Aventura Hotel.

2359
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,000
It's new in the last year. So that's really cool.

2360
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,760
The theme of that hotel is cool.

2361
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:12,160
Hotel like I had a great burger in the lobby

2362
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,440
food court and the rooftop bar was really neat.

2363
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,840
We all the stuff we're glossing over, we did Hagrid's.

2364
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:19,640
It was incredible.

2365
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:20,760
Hagrid's is worse.

2366
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:24,480
That's I think Scott kept saying like there's six months worth of content.

2367
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,840
And I know we're loaded up.

2368
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,240
Yeah, we can leave Anaheim in the dust.

2369
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,000
Finally, yeah, some complaints I have.

2370
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,800
No shirts that say the contemporary on them.

2371
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,440
This is insane.

2372
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:39,160
This is every time we go, we go to that gift shop and I ask a poor employee,

2373
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:42,040
I go, where are the shirts that say contemporary?

2374
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,400
We don't really have them.

2375
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,360
Well, there's like one Polynesian one.

2376
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,680
And he's like, yeah, I don't know.

2377
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,760
They just don't have them.

2378
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,520
We want classic logo, contemporary.

2379
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,000
Yeah. Building shirt.

2380
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,880
Come on. Yeah.

2381
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,160
Let's have let's do it.

2382
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,880
Got to give the Universal Hotels credit.

2383
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,720
Every hotel gift shop has hotel merchandise.

2384
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,200
Of course. And probably one of the canniest theme park

2385
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,160
moves I've ever seen.

2386
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,800
Every gift shop has a corner

2387
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,440
that looks like a tiny Harry Potter gift shop.

2388
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,640
Yeah. So you are not getting out if you like Harry Potter

2389
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:13,280
and you forgot something at the park.

2390
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:16,360
Don't worry. You can get it the five other places now.

2391
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,600
Yeah. I didn't die.

2392
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,760
Gunner Gringotts all amazing gringots.

2393
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,520
I really loved it.

2394
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,440
I was very surprised to have done that.

2395
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,000
And that's all. Sure.

2396
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,560
Oh, Epcot Preview Center.

2397
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,480
That's what I was going to say.

2398
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:30,720
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

2399
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,040
I was going to say Fast and Furious Supercharge.

2400
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,360
Well, we got it.

2401
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,600
That'll be a full life episode.

2402
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,640
Just to say, yes, if you want to,

2403
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:45,600
if you want a bump in song in your queue in 2019,

2404
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,560
what do you guys think?

2405
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,000
I would say gasoline.

2406
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,640
We talked about before.

2407
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:55,800
So you think gasoline that would be perfect, Scott, you guess?

2408
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,160
I forget the other thing that's like that.

2409
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:02,360
I don't it's not on the tip of my tongue.

2410
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,480
How about turned down for what?

2411
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:05,960
Whoa, really? Yeah.

2412
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,760
He's all right. I'm all right.

2413
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,280
We're on that in the future.

2414
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,720
Yeah, that'll be a good one.

2415
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,440
Well, I preview center.

2416
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,000
We can. We certainly don't have time to talk about

2417
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,280
Race Through New York with Jimmy Fallon.

2418
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,880
Oh, my gosh. It's coming.

2419
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,200
It's coming on the Patreon someday.

2420
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,280
Not anytime soon, but still follow the Patreon.

2421
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,400
Yeah, because we'll get to it.

2422
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,040
That's where that's where Jimmy Fallon will live.

2423
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,320
All of the teases are coming.

2424
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,240
Yes. Yeah. So that's for sure.

2425
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,520
We're doing our own preview center here a little bit.

2426
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,840
That Epcot Preview Center, if you're in Disney World, don't miss it.

2427
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
So cool.

2428
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,720
The gist of it being there's just like a it's a white,

2429
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,480
unadorned model of future worlds,

2430
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:48,440
and they project a ton of stuff all over it that showcases the things that are coming,

2431
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:53,240
whether it be the Mary Poppins ride eventually or the Ratatouille ride.

2432
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,920
Or this is one part where this boring guy starts giving this presentation about

2433
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,120
we are setting up shop and we will be emissaries here in future.

2434
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:06,120
And then it starts glitching out and then it gets unplugged all together.

2435
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:09,800
And you hear a familiar voice say, boring.

2436
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,080
And it's frigging rocket.

2437
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:17,720
He unplugged the whole thing and he turns it into a P Funk spectacular.

2438
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,560
Now it's not boring at all.

2439
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,520
Thanks for saving us from that boring guy.

2440
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,960
Looking forward to a cosmic rewind with you, buddy. Yeah. Yeah.

2441
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,640
That was all really cool.

2442
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,800
I'll say this, if you go to that preview center, if you like any of that merchandise,

2443
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,120
it is only at the preview center.

2444
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:36,320
So buy it there, because I ran through the rain to go back for something

2445
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:38,840
because I could not find it anywhere else.

2446
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:41,920
So, yeah. And also there's it's a rap.

2447
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,400
It's like, did you say 360 like, oh, yeah.

2448
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:50,640
Yeah. So yeah, that thing lives in my beloved Odyssey.

2449
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:55,200
This mostly unused, amazing piece of Epcot architecture. Yeah. So great.

2450
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,280
So it was sharp paint job.

2451
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:00,920
I like I think the I think the design of Epcot's head and in a good place.

2452
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,920
It's this like retro, but future, but current.

2453
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,880
I think it's I think it's going to be great.

2454
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,200
I agree. I think I think, yeah, that's good.

2455
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:11,280
We're going to have to get to phase two before they like fix imagination,

2456
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,600
which whatever they do, we want figment to stay.

2457
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,720
But like I think, yeah, like in eight years,

2458
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,160
the whole thing's going to look real nice. Yeah.

2459
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:21,160
And then like a lot of it will look nice and like three.

2460
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:25,880
Yeah. Surprising lack of figment in that preview center, though.

2461
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,440
Yeah. With it. Yeah.

2462
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:29,680
I don't know. They are not sure.

2463
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,680
People have probably seen online.

2464
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,480
There's a lot of like surveys you get if you've been to the parks.

2465
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,760
And it'll it's just questions about figment.

2466
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,080
It's like, do you know who this is?

2467
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,840
Do you like this character?

2468
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:43,480
Did you come to Epcot to see this character?

2469
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:47,120
Questions that are just trying to figure out data wise, like doing

2470
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,800
what will happen if we take him out?

2471
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,640
If this character showed you what a skunk smells like, would you like that or not?

2472
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,680
Yeah. Does a toilet on the ceiling equal imagination to you?

2473
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:01,800
Which, of course, Tony Baxter famously said it does not know famously famously.

2474
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:06,200
So, oh, you know, one more other thing.

2475
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:11,040
If we're shutting out specific people or characters or mice, we took a

2476
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:14,680
I love the photo we all got with Mickey

2477
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:17,040
a writer right after the International Gateway.

2478
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,160
Remember how awesome that Mickey was?

2479
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:20,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2480
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,640
Asked Mickey. Yes.

2481
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:26,480
Who? Aaron reminded me what the business was before we walked up.

2482
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,720
Somebody was wearing a shirt with Minnie and he chose.

2483
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:34,960
Mickey chose to get mad and jealous and he like stomped and huffed and puffed.

2484
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:38,280
Like, how dare you have my girlfriend on your shirt?

2485
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:43,160
And then he like and then he kind of stared at us in a way that was like,

2486
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,400
I don't know if I'm ready. And we said, do you need a second?

2487
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,520
And then he did like a like little zen move.

2488
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,920
Yeah. Calm down.

2489
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,840
Find your center.

2490
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,720
And then somebody had a coffee and Mickey grabbed the coffee

2491
01:55:55,720 --> 01:56:00,240
and acted all coffee jittery and hoarded it and then like just darted his head around.

2492
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:04,200
This was some fantastic, like new character business.

2493
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,960
Like I'd never seen. Yeah.

2494
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:07,480
Such a good Mickey.

2495
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,880
One of the best characters.

2496
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,880
Oh, and we were talking about the in-room channels.

2497
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,640
One of them was just the Mickey Mouse shorts. Yes.

2498
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,680
And they were so funny. We like that.

2499
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,560
I mean, I guess I knew that already, but I never like really got to sit

2500
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,040
and watch them so great.

2501
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:24,120
I love that they play those in a loop all the time.

2502
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,200
Maybe they're letting Mickey be funny and crazy,

2503
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:28,720
because that's what you get out of their shorts.

2504
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:31,520
Yeah. He's like crazy and weird and dirty.

2505
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,400
And yeah, he's going to be crazy on Runaway Railway.

2506
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,360
Yeah. So which is fun.

2507
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:39,960
We saw really not as good as Mickey, but I want to say also with the Mickey thing,

2508
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:42,360
just so much time like there.

2509
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,880
Yeah. You got a lot of you got a lot of time with Mickey, a lot of memorable time,

2510
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,960
which usually sometimes they rush in and out.

2511
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,160
We also met Launchpad McQuack, which we were very excited about.

2512
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:52,880
We saw Scrooge. We should have done Scrooge, too.

2513
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,840
But Launchpad had a very small line.

2514
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:59,320
And that was really fun because they're doing a whole like Donald Duck

2515
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:04,600
Festival over by Dinoland USA, because I think that not many people go to Dinoland.

2516
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,480
So it's some sort of Duck Festival.

2517
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,440
So if you were looking for seats, if you were looking for duck seats

2518
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:13,960
everywhere in that place, because you could have a photo up with Scrooge,

2519
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:16,080
Launchpad, Daisy, Donald.

2520
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,880
I think that was it. But that was fun.

2521
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,000
Good characters, good food, good time.

2522
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,080
I mean, like we did.

2523
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,320
Yeah, there's so much stuff we are forgetting, but we'll come up.

2524
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,480
Trickle into other episodes.

2525
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,960
You know, it's a funny one to close on and a very

2526
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:34,440
crucial one because we met so many characters that we love.

2527
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:38,880
But I think there's a character that's very near and dear to our hearts now

2528
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:39,880
that didn't used to be.

2529
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:42,280
And that character is Lil Abner.

2530
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:47,920
And we didn't realize, yes, Lil Abner, who are we all listeners?

2531
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,280
You all love Dogpatch USA.

2532
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:54,800
Sure. Closed, dangerous Arkansas Park as much as we do there.

2533
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:58,400
I didn't realize in that comic in Toon Lagoon, in that comic zone,

2534
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:02,280
when we found it, Jason and Aaron and I found a little there is a little

2535
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,520
at Lil Abner corner. Yeah.

2536
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,240
It called the Skunk Works.

2537
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,680
Yeah, there's skunks in a that was something I hadn't seen in ages.

2538
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:14,920
All the little features of Toon Lagoon, all the little characters make sounds,

2539
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:19,000
all the like Heathcliff was lowering a bone in front of a doghouse.

2540
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,280
Like all of that was running.

2541
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:23,840
This is a boring guy who talks to you about nature really quietly.

2542
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:28,440
Mark Traill was telling you about the glory of nature.

2543
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:32,560
And while Jeffy from the family circus makes a mess,

2544
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,840
it refers to Mark Traill.

2545
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:38,120
Yes, it is a crossover crossover.

2546
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:42,720
Flintstones, Flintstones, Meet the Jetsons, Jeffy meets Mark Traill

2547
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,800
only at Islands of Adventure.

2548
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,040
Only at Islands of Adventure.

2549
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:49,080
And we and let's we should make sure after this episode, we post all the

2550
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,920
there's a lot of great photo ops with Jason all over Toon Lagoon.

2551
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,400
Yes, a lot of Nancy.

2552
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,320
There was multiple Nancy and Sluggo.

2553
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,080
And Sluggo. Well, Jason is Sluggo.

2554
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,800
Yes, Jason is Jeffy. Jason is Sluggo.

2555
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,240
Jason is every character over there.

2556
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,120
He's Dadwood.

2557
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:06,760
He's what I imagined Lil Abner looked like before I realized

2558
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:10,960
it was this scary satire that's mean to hillbillies.

2559
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,120
I assumed he was like funnel dude.

2560
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:14,040
Yeah. Yeah.

2561
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,600
But you were I mean, obviously you were created for the Harvey

2562
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,720
Comics character line.

2563
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:21,880
You were created in the same vein as Casper and Hot Stuff the Little Devil.

2564
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:25,360
And then when I caused too much mischief,

2565
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,960
I get shipped off to the army like Beetle Bailey.

2566
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,760
You are a lot like Beetle Bailey as well.

2567
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:31,720
Yeah. All of them.

2568
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,360
Well, you met everyone that you're like, and we'll post that to the Twitter.

2569
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:39,400
And I guess on that note, let me plug the other stuff and I'll say you survive

2570
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:43,600
podcast the ride and we survived a week in Orlando.

2571
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,720
It was a pleasure to go with y'all.

2572
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,120

2573
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:51,120
Thanks to SAC for inspiring our trip. Yeah.

2574
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,480
And maybe we'll be back.

2575
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:56,000
We'll be back. God willing, we'll be back sooner rather than later.

2576
