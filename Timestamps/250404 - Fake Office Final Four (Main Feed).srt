1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Spaceships, mountains, fairy tale kingdoms.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Theme park creators can take us to these places without even breaking a sweat.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who cares?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Our question?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What craftsmen, what artisans could dare to show us?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A desk.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A cup full of pens.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A little plant.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To shine a light on our actual day-to-day work lives via a little lamp.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then glue that lamp to a desk so guests can't steal the lamp.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you're listening to this episode at the office, prepare to be transported to a bunch of different offices, which are fake.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's the Fake Office Final Four on Podcast The Ride.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Welcome to the phony workplace war zone.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The ultimate debate of deceitful desk dominance.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's the Fake Office Final Four here on Podcast The Ride.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hello there, yes.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I am rocked and ready to go.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am rock hard.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Excuse me, I meant to say I'm rock hard and ready to go and debate.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I am rock hard and no one will notice as we are all behind desks.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That is some of the benefit of talking about desks.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can be as rock hard as you want.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think I meant to use rock as if it was a paperweight for an office.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Something you would find in a fake or real office.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Either or.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm as rock hard as a paperweight.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Jason Sheridan, hi.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hi.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sporting more of a half chub under my desk.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm a little more distracted because my fingers are like really raw and bleeding

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
because I kept trying to steal post-it notes and pens and other off supplies,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which is my usual M.O. working in an office.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You slice yourself up with a paper?

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's not the M.O.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Stealing is the M.O.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Stealing is the M.O.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Stealing, I don't think I've bought office supplies since the late 2000s.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Really?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm still going, well, I buy pens if I see a sale of cool pens or I have a coupon.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Cool pens sale today you'll see on a store and then, ooh, in I go.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But besides that.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll tell you, I got a coupon from Staples once.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It was $10 off $10.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I bought $11 worth of pens and I was like a pig in shit.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Audience on their feet right now.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Staples coupon talk right out the gate.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They're bringing out the big guns.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Garcinia Wall Show in the early 90s right now.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyone calm down.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We'll leave three minutes.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So let's just like kind of do nothing for three minutes while they calm down from the cool pens Staples talk.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just trying to get me off his five.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Real quick, just a real quick question I swear for Jason.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Have you bought blank paper in a long time for a printer or otherwise?

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, I still haven't properly configured that printer our friend Andrew gave me like two years ago.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Configured?

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Set it up, connect it to the Wi-Fi, buy ink cartridges, find my blank paper.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Plug it in I guess would be step one of the configuring.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Plugging it in, finding space for it.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When was the last time you bought computer paper?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
At Target maybe like two years ago.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OK.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because you know what I was doing?

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was going to Fry's Electronics.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
One of their services, you could take an empty ink cartridge and they would put a syringe of ink in it and filled up.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They would shoot it up.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They would shoot it up.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Like a heroin needle.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They'd just like go right into the heart and just really?

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, it was like a third of the price of ink cartridge.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't anymore.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wow.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This just like fill up like a top-off station of ink.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Reusable, yeah reusable ink.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's interesting.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, I don't know.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Some places might still do that.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hmm.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OK.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So you have bought supplies recently.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Jason, you got to remember I had an office day job 2010 to 2017.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I'm used to replying all on every email telling people this is done.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look at the cockiness.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You know?

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Look at this.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is like a wrestling problem.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's coming in.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's going to win this thing.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I know the competition isn't between us, but if it was, Jason is going to win.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He does reply all.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I just still have office brain from working in the office.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
From how long ago?

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mike, every now and then you reply to logistical email, like ad emails or something emails,

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
but you don't reply all.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sometimes I don't.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I'm like, whatever happened with that?

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And you're like, oh, I took care of that a week ago.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't want you guys to have to deal with some of the emails.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I just go, I'll deal with it.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I love done email.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh man, my old job.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You talk about your email being full all the time with different ads.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You miss all our work emails, you say.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm taking some all to a month.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You guys are my important email.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I got the star.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The star comes up from Mike and Scott and Jane.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They do.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You claimed that they fall through the car.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You were claiming a little while ago that you lose emails because you have so many.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I corrected that.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I starred you guys and my mom, my stepdad, my brother.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, that's since the discussion.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Since then.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So from now on, reply all.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will never just reply because I think I can take care of a problem quickly.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You knew about this?

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're going to get caught for so long in this story.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I made a mistake.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But the reply all, you know that Mike has not failed to do reply all on podcast business.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's something you know about.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't think I was aware of that.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Only because we've discussed it.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's never something huge.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, it'll be something from the podcast network and it's like, do you approve a pencil ad or something?

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sometimes I'll just say, I'll just reply.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you approve this ad for a pill that gets you a half chub?

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, exactly.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And we'll say we do because actually we wouldn't be comfortable with the full chub.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But knowing that it's only going to lead to a half because we're only.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I would roll that one by you guys if it was a half chub pill.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Although I should have just said, yep, but only Jason's willing to do the ad for it.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And it's some weird, that gets disguised.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Like, are we comfortable endorsing Xanthan X?

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What is it?

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's that half chub pill.

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a half chub.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They try to dress it up with a fancy name.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, every now and then there's ads about, you know, products for children.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I step back.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, I don't want to say we'll do that.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's on you guys, you know?

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, but you're sitting there like, come on, we got to do this ad and make that money.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't care about those kids.

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're sitting there hoping I say yes.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, yeah, I'm chomping on my stogie.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
My apartment smells like shit because I'm chomping on stogies all day.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Right, yes.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So Rick, this is a runner on the show.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Your hatred of stogies.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've never heard a word said with more dripping, maybe bourbon and steak.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But besides that, you have such malice for the word stogies.

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've got a real sensitive sense of smell, Scott, and I've got real sensitive eyes.

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Especially in allergy seasons.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So you resent, have you walked into a room that was loaded with stogie smoke that ruined you for the season?

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't think so.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, then he's done a good job successfully avoiding stogies.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Trying to avoid it.

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah.

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The beaches at the Jersey Shore, there was always like-

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A stogie guy.

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A big dad would post up with his nasty cigars, cigarillos.

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And the sea air would take it right there.

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The wind would bring it right to you, you know?

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And you'd see a seagull pass through, just choke and fall to the sand.

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

176
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't know, they're a little wild there.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They'd probably try to eat it.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They'll eat anything.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You've never seen a Jersey seagulls sucking down stogies.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Smoking stogies while they fly on the shore.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Last couple years-

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, you've never seen a stogie being smoked by a seagull on the shore.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, a seagull?

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Last couple years, there's been falconers walk around the War Walk with falcons.

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh.

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because they-

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Like, for photographs to be taken, or are they hunting something?

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, they release the bird to scare away other birds, and then it comes back to him.

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, okay.

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then the falcon sometimes.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are they paid by the state to do that, or they just do it?

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Probably paid by the city.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The city.

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They employ falconers to scare birds away?

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's interesting.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, they get a little out of hand.

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They should pay some people to scare the stogie smokers away.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Caw, caw.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Some of those birds-

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My grandmother had a half of the sandwich once, and she was talking.

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the bird just swooped in and took it away.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That would have been a great story if it had just ended at half a sandwich.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My grandmother had half a sandwich one time.

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But there was more there.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Those diagonal cut peach sandwiches hit different, brother.

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What's in there?

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What's in that sandwich?

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Maybe a tuna fish, maybe a simple peanut butter and jelly.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you think there's a chance that-

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
One minute, one minute.

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The bird steals a sandwich out of your hand at City Food?

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Too windy for birds up there.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The birds get blown away.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No bird could navigate.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They save money on falconer.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Too noisy with all the construction, too.

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, lately, you're saying.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Lately, yeah.

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, there's a lot going on up there.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, but there's a lot going on here.

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We should get to the premise of the episode.

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Today is the Fake Office Final Four.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is exciting.

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think we haven't done one of these in two years.

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We missed it last year due to the City Walk stuff.

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We are back with another competition this year.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is not the only bracket-based premise in comedy podcasts,

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but it is the most ignorant of how sports work.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Correct.

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We're really excited about that area that we've carved out for ourselves.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's what we can really lay claim to.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Some of this has been gone over a little bit on the Patreon

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
because we did a little bit of a pre-show this year over on the Second Gate

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
where we figured out the rules.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We got settled on some of the opponents, but not all of them.

237
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We'll still do the reveal here in this episode.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But this kind of came to us because we were talking about the newish ride,

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Tiana's Bayou Adventure.

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We were remarking how much we like Tiana's office in the line

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and how often theme park queues have weird little offices that you go by,

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
possibly in cages, at the very least behind velvet ropes,

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
things trying to prevent you from reaching into the office,

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
from trying to steal office supplies, as Jason might want to do.

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Because they can't watch and ensure that people cut themselves on the sticky notes.

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That stuff's valuable. They can't afford to lose it.

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oftentimes, the office supplies bolted down or glued down.

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is true.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can't take one of the fake croissants from the Daily Bugle office.

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, I can't take the excess tech memo on the collector's desk.

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Collector's desk.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Anyway, we like our weird little offices in cages.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We realized in the episode this might be the way to go,

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and we did manage to narrow it down.

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, you know what? Not quite narrow it down to 16.

256
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We are entering this one not fully secure,

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
even despite having done a pre-episode.

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That might have only slowed us down, created more questions rather than answers.

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Before we get into the official list and the official divisions,

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
apologies to a few that didn't end up making it.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The Ghost Town Sheriff's Office in Knott's Berry Farm did not make it.

262
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We, I think, determined that Officer Zizek's little pod was not...

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think there's an argument to be made and justice to be had

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
for little security consoles for aliens or robots.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you consider those offices and desks?

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But I think none of them made it this year.

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And we did, of course, in the episode over on the second gate,

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
determine that despite Jason's question, which I liked a lot,

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Madame Leota's table, Madame Leota's seance room,

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we are not considering an office for these purposes.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Some, look, some big schools often get knocked out.

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, despite their best efforts and despite being very cool.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, I almost wish it was in.

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If we're feeling overwhelmed by one of these,

275
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
we could certainly knock one out and put Leota back in just for fun.

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But let's see how we feel as we go down the line.

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Can I apologize about an office that's not in the bracket

278
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
unless you guys light up and we want to throw it in?

279
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We decide to put it in.

280
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What do you think?

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Dock on Dars little cage office in Batu,

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
something I did not think about until today.

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He's got like his like bean counter on the back wall.

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He's got a little desk.

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's got little trinkets.

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's clearly, you know, its own thing from the actual store from the from.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So so it is his office.

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Right. My knee jerk was no, that's a store.

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But you're right. He does have.

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's got an office, a little booth.

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's kind of like where, you know, Danny DeVito or Louie was in taxi,

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
a little a little caged off this batch.

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm trying to get a good view of it just to I mean, I'm I'm into it.

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I just don't know what goes.

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah. What if what if he's on deck?

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What if he's on deck in case of injury?

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I would like a case of boredom.

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Sure. And I would like to declare this.

299
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This will flaunt the rules of a traditional bracket like none of the other

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
final fours we've ever done.

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
OK, yes. Now, what do you mean?

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You mean that we are going to anything is on the table here.

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean, we're not going to we're not going to fit into your little 16.

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

305
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We're going to get crazy with it.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We can. And don't yell.

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We're going to yell at us.

308
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We're going to configure this thing crazier than adjacent printer.

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This thing's going to be wild.

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
More complex than hooking up a printer in the year twenty twenty five.

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I am stunned by the Canon company.

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You know, what do you mean?

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's I have to try to put it on Earth.

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, I know. I just haven't gotten around to it.

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I haven't made space for it.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Look, I got limited energy a lot of time.

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
My hands hurt like one of my eyes.

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You know, are you got to prioritize holding space for the printer?

319
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I am holding space.

320
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Very good. Yeah.

321
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's made it to the office.

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you think it be do you think that Ariana and Cynthia's long fingernails

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
would make it easier or harder to use a Canon printer?

324
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It might be it might make them more precise with hitting the buttons.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Like, I don't know.

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You wouldn't miss aim like us and our our big chunkers, our half chubs of fingers.

327
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You would have to.

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You would have to. Yeah.

329
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Like if you had long nail, I'm trying to imagine it right now.

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But maybe like better.

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You know, it'd be good for like answering telephones, like being an old telephone

332
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
operator like Lily Tomlin.

333
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, that would be fun.

334
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That would look fun.

335
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So you just got to be careful with those long nails, because if you hit something

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
on the wrong angle or wrong force snap, it's gone.

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The whole thing's off. Yeah.

338
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah. Yeah.

339
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Mm hmm.

340
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I would hate for that.

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All right.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, Doc Gondar on deck.

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I think just anybody call it as you see it.

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I like this thing being a little loose, a little chaotic.

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If we need to draft candidates in.

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And we did organize these things kind of in little divisions just because I thought

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it might be a good way to highlight the types of fake offices that we run into in

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
theme park attractions, mainly cues.

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
When you add it up, it really is places that either that you are walking through

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
or like the things that are entirely walk through attractions where there's not a

352
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
lot of offices in rides.

353
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I think that it's always like it's waiting areas.

354
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's on the way you're seeing them on foot usually.

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I wonder what that's about.

357
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Maybe I guess you're on a ride and you want to go somewhere more interesting than an

358
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
office.

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah.

360
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There's a thing.

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know.

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This is not too big of a tangent.

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I've always been fascinated by doing a ride that would really simulate reality in a

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
way.

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So the idea of a ride in an office, maybe something fantastical happens, but maybe

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
it's just the office ride, the NBC show, the office, or it's something that ends up

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
being more fantastical.

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So I am fascinated by what you're saying.

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There's very little of that in the actual ride.

370
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's almost insane that there is not enough.

371
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What if you, the vehicle, was going on the wild one shot journey of making one of

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
those music videos they would make all the time?

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Maybe it's just one scene.

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
In my head, the office was doing flash mobs.

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Every episode, yeah.

376
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
By season six.

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There were twice an episode flash mobs.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's possible.

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's sounding more like OK Go, what you were talking about.

380
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
OK Go treadmill video.

381
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They would make OK Go style videos where everybody pops around and slides around.

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And you, the vehicle, are the winding path of the one shot cameraman that this paper

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
company uses to make fun videos.

384
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think that you do it.

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I got surprised.

386
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It seems like we will definitely.

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The future portal in Epic Universe.

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Scranton.

389
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, because there's a new one coming, so it's ripe.

390
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
World of Scranton.

391
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They would dress it up.

392
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It couldn't just be the office.

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

394
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know.

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Enter the Dunder Mifflin verse.

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know how you dress it up exactly.

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I see you make it a bigger thing.

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, I don't know.

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I haven't even really crunched it.

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We can figure it out.

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Have you guys been to Scranton before?

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Have not.

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No.

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
OK.

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He's really cocky today.

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

407
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm winning this thing.

408
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm just trying to stay awake.

409
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hey, cockiness keeps you awake.

410
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Great.

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

412
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When you're thinking of Scranton, it shoots your body full of excitement.

413
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, it's just funny to me that it's like, this is the no rules bracket.

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I thought we were going to come in with a locked bracket and we'll keep this thing tight.

415
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And you guys are like, no, we're flying by the seat of our pants.

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I'm like, all right, let's do it, brother.

417
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's go crazy.

418
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So it's not a problem for you.

419
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

420
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, I know.

421
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You seemed mad at the beginning there.

422
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I thought we were locked, and now we're not.

423
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, we can start getting into it.

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I think we should get into it.

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, let's get into it.

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
All right.

427
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So this first area, the first division, this is what still requires a narrow down for us.

428
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But this is one of the biggest areas of fake office in theme parkdom, and that is jungle makeshifts.

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We ran into so many of these.

430
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We figured make it a division.

431
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And here is the list of five that needs to be narrowed down.

432
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The Indiana Jones office from the Indiana Jones Adventure, Expedition Everest, Jungle Cruise.

433
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And even in that, there's discussion of what is the Jungle Cruise office.

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The Adventureland Treehouse.

435
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And what's the office there?

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
In my head, going through it, and I haven't been there in person.

437
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Maybe you can help, Mike.

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The Daughters Observatory is an observatory.

439
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's where you see a desk.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's kind of the most like art designed, like room for work.

441
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And finally, Journey to the Center of the Earth.

442
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There's a classic caged office in the queue for that in Tokyo DisneySea.

443
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay.

444
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I think maybe the most efficient thing is that we all, before we even get into it, vote for one of these to go.

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Jungle Cruise.

446
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

447
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everest.

448
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Jason.

449
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Jason, what goes?

450
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What goes?

451
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm going to try to move this along and also say Jungle Cruise.

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wow.

453
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Jungle Cruise is out.

454
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Jungle Cruise gone.

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Why the immediate thought for that?

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I just think it's a little ad hoc.

457
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's more queue than office.

458
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't know Journey to the Center of the Earth.

459
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I haven't been to DisneySea.

460
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So I didn't want to vote that one out.

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And I didn't want us to come to a three-way steal.

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, some of it for me is just that when I think of these as having a lot of personality, I like, by the way, this is no knock against the Jungle Cruise.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But the other four, I have a stronger feeling in my mind about their identity.

464
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
With the Jungle Cruise, I like the aesthetic, I like the line, I like the stuff I'm seeing when I go back over the queue.

465
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But the other four just stand out.

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And there has to be a loser here.

467
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The fact that we don't know.

468
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's part of it too.

469
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There's a different one in my head from Disneyland and Disney World.

470
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If it was that, one of them is the radio room.

471
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But what's the radio room?

472
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's good.

473
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The radio room's good.

474
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't get me wrong.

475
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
People are already mad right now.

476
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But I say don't be mad at me.

477
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's so much character.

478
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's playing my Spotify top five all over the place.

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

480
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's old-timey music.

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And yeah, this is a tough competition.

482
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
All right.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, that was good and efficient.

484
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And no offense taken that you were against me there.

485
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You got to do what we got to do.

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

487
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I have entered the candidates into a randomizer.

488
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So we didn't know the pair until now.

489
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So right now the debate is between Adventureland Treehouse,

490
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
the Daughters Observatory, and Journey to the Center of the Earth.

491
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes.

492
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay.

493
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So the Daughters Observatory, I think this is a very lovely room.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know, you've got a lot of like celestial art on the wall.

495
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You've got kind of a, is this like a makeshift telescope?

496
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is it made out of a barrel and stuff?

497
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's like a fun Gilligan's Island professor making something out of something.

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then this wonderful, what would you call it?

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Like a mobile.

500
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes.

501
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That is like, you know, and I haven't been, I haven't seen this in person,

502
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
but it's like a solar system mobile that seems like lit up with special gems.

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I mean, this is the right, I will say the right family landed on this island

504
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because they are craftsmen.

505
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't know how they managed to get this done with just a bunch of rocks and coconuts

506
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
because this is a beautiful place.

507
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes.

508
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I was skeptical about this one.

509
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And then when I looked at pictures, I'm like, this one has a lot of character.

510
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It seems practical.

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I think it's got something that the other ones don't have.

512
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
A lot of natural light.

513
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You can't work in the darkness.

514
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I think this is going to come up in other categories.

515
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Now, I think there are probably some very cool offices that have no natural light at all.

516
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We should respect those for what they are.

517
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Sure.

518
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Especially like a villainous character might want no light whatsoever.

519
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But I do, part of me is factoring into these decisions.

520
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What office would I want to work in?

521
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Maybe that's not fair, but it's in my head, you know.

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It feels like it needs to have qualities of a space that would be, you know,

523
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
that would leave me with an open mind, that would make me a free thinker.

524
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You know, where do I want to sit and get some work done?

525
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And I totally would in the Adventureland treehouse.

526
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I think going with your gut is fair, Scott.

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think that should be on the table because you think about people playing basketball.

528
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
They're making split-second decisions of like, do I go to him or him?

529
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You know, like, oh, my gut's telling me this one and oh, he made the shot or oh, we missed.

530
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, well.

531
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
On to the next thing.

532
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Look at that.

533
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
See, I didn't spot one error in there.

534
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We do know plenty about sports.

535
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Wow, yeah, he's right.

536
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Journey to the Center of the Earth is a very, this might fall more into the lab category,

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
where other offices that we have seen and will see are kind of more spare and like tidy and organized.

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is absolute chaos.

539
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
There is stuff everywhere.

540
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There's supplies in a big net up at the top.

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's a tiny space and there could not be more packed into it.

542
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:13,000
This is the workspace of somebody furiously frustrated at being unable to tap into their theories

543
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
about what the hell is at the center of the goddamn Earth.

544
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So many crumpled up papers, tons of test tubes with different colors and supplies, a big hatch door.

545
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah.

546
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Cool space.

547
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Cool space.

548
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Definitely a cool space.

549
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Anything you want to highlight about it?

550
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah.

551
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Here's the thing with me that still keeps this very strongly in the mix for my affection or my decision, I should say.

552
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I love beakers.

553
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
As a kid, beakers with different color liquid in them, obsessed with these.

554
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Sure.

555
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The idea of not, even though not thinking about it as a kid, I think I always thought they were potions.

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I didn't think they were like chemicals that would hurt me if I drank them.

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So obviously there's a kid element to just imagining what's in those beakers and bottle, what the experiments are happening.

558
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Sure.

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So the idea that there is a room, which I think, is there a room with more beakers?

560
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, maybe one.

561
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I think, I don't know if there's a room with more unusual beakers.

562
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

563
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
More unusual colors.

564
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's one we'll bring up later.

565
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So I'm just saying this is a, from a kid's perspective, from a kid's playground, I am very excited by this.

566
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

567
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And it's very striking when you're there.

568
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's very striking.

569
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's a hell of a cue.

570
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Great cue.

571
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And you got that like sort of steampunk aesthetic, which I now, it's not fully Dr. Toosome-ish.

572
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You know, I shouldn't, that shouldn't be my frame of reference for steampunk now.

573
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But I do like the copper.

574
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I do like...

575
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh, copper's a good word to highlight.

576
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

577
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's really...

578
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Good crystals.

579
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes.

580
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And there's a...

581
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
There's a frenzy in this place.

582
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And the character of who works in here, I think, is on display.

583
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yes.

584
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Now, the problem is, because like, you know, there's this picture of it where it's like,

585
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
you can see into it from the cue, and that looks cool, and there's a little mystery in there.

586
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
A little claustrophobic in there.

587
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It is a little claustrophobic.

588
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And I think I am tying in, part of my affection is from the ride itself, steampunk aesthetic itself,

589
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
a lot of other factors.

590
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And yes, the office, just independent, is probably less beautiful and pleasant as the Treehouse.

591
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah.

592
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I mean, you almost can't expect it to be.

593
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It can't be.

594
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I know, I know, I know.

595
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's not the story that they're telling.

596
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But when we think about, if we do care about, is this a space that you want to be in, I

597
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
don't know.

598
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think, I'm going to go with my gut, Jason's style, basketball style, and say Adventureland

599
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Treehouse.

600
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I am as well.

601
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I agree with you.

602
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wow, that's a three-way.

603
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Okay, okay.

604
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, I agree.

605
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, you know what, and so we're a little bit of discussion, because I think if we hadn't

606
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
highlighted the pleasantry of it, that mobile is just wonderful.

607
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's great.

608
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah.

609
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I think the key to being in an office five days a week or so, or even a few split working

610
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
from home, is personalizing it, is making it comfortable for you.

611
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Uh-huh, absolutely.

612
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,380
And that's why, what amenities have you recently added to the research for it, that make it

613
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,000
a place that is fun and not oppressive?

614
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:36,840
Oh, let's see, lots of water, the tower of morning, lunch, evening bedtime pills, trying

615
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,800
to stay on top of filling that up.

616
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Great, all right.

617
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,640
Do you have necessities in there?

618
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,440
No decor, you haven't made a little origami bird that's dangling from the top of the fort?

619
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
No.

620
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,920
Okay, well that's an idea, maybe be inspired by the treehouse, by the decorations up on

621
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
the roof.

622
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,160
Trying to clean up, you know, I get a little addicted to iCloud tabs, I've got tabs on

623
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:07,720
the laptop, the iPad, the phone, and it's like, sometimes when I'm scatterbrained, I'm

624
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,360
just open it tabs, I'm never actually reading, you know, defector articles or like watching

625
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,520
videos or stuff that I put aside.

626
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,120
Well, this isn't, yeah, don't just open tabs, look at them, actually see the tab.

627
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,240
Anyone can open a tab, not everybody can enjoy what's in the tab.

628
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,400
No, no, I got a baby at home who can't do either, frankly, so we should appreciate what

629
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
we have as adults.

630
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
That's right.

631
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Okay, next category, Expedition Everest versus Indiana Jones' office in the temple.

632
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Wowee wowee.

633
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,880
Okay, Everest, what are some details of Everest?

634
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:57,680
This is very early into the queue of this attraction in Animal Kingdom, I see, I'm going

635
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,520
to be honest with you, I'm going to Indiana Jones right here and now.

636
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Wow.

637
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Yeah, I'm going to do that too.

638
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,200
There's photos and it's fine, it's fine, but I was just gearing up to like really give

639
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,360
the hard sell on this and you know what, I got to vote with my heart right here and now.

640
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,280
So if you guys are passionate about Everest, I will leave it to you to, what's that you

641
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
do?

642
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
You just voted for Indy.

643
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Yeah, I just gave it to Indy.

644
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh, that's all right, well that was fast.

645
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,080
Do you want to make a declaration?

646
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,040
I guess I was going to, I probably would have said Indy anyway, but I just, the Everest

647
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,920
queue and the office and everything, I think I've said this before, the first time I had

648
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,520
been back to Disney World in many years, look, I knew that was a line for a ride, but they

649
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,560
had made it so authentic that there were part of me that was looking at the things on the

650
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,880
desk and on the wall and going, oh, is this some of these real?

651
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,440
And then finally I'd get to, like for whatever reason, the Joe Roady touch gave that an authenticity

652
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,520
that I feel most fake offices and queues don't have, so I just want to highlight that.

653
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,440
But Indiana Jones, fair enough.

654
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,040
The detail is amazing, but Indiana Jones is a close personal friend, just like Spider-Man.

655
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,720
Now I would say perhaps everyone's affection for the man is doing a little heavy lifting

656
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
here.

657
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,760
It definitely colors it because we can imagine, this is an office that Indiana Jones has worked

658
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
in.

659
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Famous man's office.

660
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,440
We don't even know, there's no characters that we know from the Everest ride, so yeah,

661
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
it's hard to unsee that.

662
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:33,440
I also, though, think it's a pretty foundational office in terms in this category of jungle

663
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
makeshifts.

664
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,560
I mean, I think it caused a lot of the other jungle makeshifts to occur, and it also occurred

665
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,840
to me that is Journey to the Center of the Earth right?

666
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,680
That's not really a jungle, whatever, too late.

667
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,280
It's already named that, and we're already through it, and that one's already out.

668
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,560
We can't edit it now.

669
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,080
No, there's no way to do that.

670
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,480
So at jungle makeshifts, it becomes Adventureland Treehouse versus Indiana Jones office, and

671
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,160
as we start to make it through, by the way, the spacious 16, we're in the spacious 16

672
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,640
right now, it'll get a little less spacious as we go.

673
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,760
The next area, another big area in terms of fake theme park offices that you run into

674
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,320
is Toondens.

675
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,920
Now, I said dens to keep it kind of tidy, but you might also call some of these studies.

676
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,360
I don't know exactly the difference.

677
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,360
I think there might be a subtle difference, but I think it could all fit under one umbrella.

678
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,320
Toondens, I have randomized the pairings.

679
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,920
Here are the pairings.

680
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,520
Well, you know what?

681
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:47,280
This was not a matchup that you wanted, Jason, but the randomizer gave it to us, so I think

682
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,480
we're stuck, unless you insist that we don't do it this way.

683
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Mickey versus Minnie.

684
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Wow.

685
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,360
Mickey's Den versus Minnie Mouse's home office.

686
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Holy crap.

687
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Holy, sorry, excuse me.

688
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Holy fucking shit.

689
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
I didn't swear enough.

691
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Sorry.

692
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
I apologize.

693
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,400
Well, hey, it is what it is.

694
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,440
We landed where we landed.

695
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,000
Mickey's Den is, I think we've put a lot of shine on.

696
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,400
We have made famous via the show and via a clip that we're fond of and that I trimmed

697
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,760
out and highlighted on our YouTube channel just to capitalize on all that viral traffic

698
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,400
of people looking for Mickey's Den.

699
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,480
But there's a special where he gives you a tour of his house, and this is in Mickey's

700
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,120
birthday land in the Magic Kingdom, which is no more, and he is pointing out different

701
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,560
rooms of the house, which are more functional than they are cartoon fun, as exemplified

702
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,960
by him ultimately saying, when I need to make a telephone call, I use the den.

703
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,840
Weird fake Mickey voice in a fake office in fake Mickey's house.

704
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,600
This actual place, I don't know if anybody's looking at photographs of it.

705
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
I pulled a few.

706
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
I got Mickey here.

707
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,200
I think what's interesting about this version of his house and this office especially, this

708
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,920
is not a silly cartoon place.

709
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,160
This is an office that conceivably Walt Disney himself could have had.

710
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
It's all real.

711
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
None of it is fun.

712
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
It's not like a big piece of cheese.

713
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,520
It's not like gigantic ear muffs that would fit over his head.

714
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,840
It's real items, most of which are like 50s era, including the phone that he uses, which

715
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,480
is a rotary and the kind where the earpiece is separate from the, now he needs this kind

716
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,640
of phone in 1989.

717
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,600
Or did they just determine this is better for a gigantic mouse's head because the only

718
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,120
way he's going to be able to make a phone call, he's stuck with the old technology.

719
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,340
But you see a globe, you see a light, you see framed photographs and there's a key to

720
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,720
a city or something up there.

721
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
It is not fun.

722
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
This is important to note.

723
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,280
This is where Mickey goes to make telephone calls, get work done.

724
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,360
Is there a cartoonish notepad or legal pad by that phone?

725
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Not that I see.

726
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
It's all just, it's just like ledgers.

727
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
It's just like.

728
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Got my chiropractors in here.

729
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,440
No, I've, look, I leave my, I leave the funny business on the screen, all right?

730
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,600
When I'm here, I'm here to work.

731
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
The whole fun colors.

732
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Get those pinks and purples out of here.

733
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,280
I don't want to see that shit, it's not a birthday cake, it's an office.

734
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,880
Can I speak on Mickey's, Minnie's, Minnie's, excuse me.

735
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,680
Yes, because Minnie's is extremely different.

736
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,080
This is, now this is a different era.

737
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,600
This is pure Toontown.

738
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,920
We are in full cartoon territory here.

739
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Yeah.

740
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:44,360
Um, it almost reminds me and like Downton Abbey, the valet's room, with all the clothes

741
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
and stuff.

742
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,720
But I think the thing that has me leaning towards Minnie is, similarly to the phone,

743
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,880
it is now anachronistic, I feel like, but that bulky beige desktop computer.

744
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,440
Yeah, I'm seeing it as pink.

745
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,800
Whatever version I'm looking at is bright pink.

746
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,640
And what Minnie has here, Mike, you brought this up in the, I think this candidate is

747
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,680
here because of you in the pre-show that we did.

748
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Yes, thank you for giving me credit.

749
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,440
And yes, of course, well, you're looking out for your girl, and I respect that.

750
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,800
The photo that you showed before was a little bit further away, and now that I've seen,

751
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,880
I haven't been in this room in a very long time, and now that I'm seeing into the contents

752
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,320
of Minnie's computer, I notice a couple of important things.

753
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,280
One, it is shaped like a heart.

754
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,000
It is a custom type of screen that no other computer screen is.

755
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah.

756
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,520
Gotta give points for that.

757
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:50,680
It also is a magic clueless before clueless type outfit customizing machine.

758
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,600
There is no, there are no letters.

759
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,440
There's no QWERTY on this keyboard.

760
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,840
If she wanted to type a letter, she couldn't.

761
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,280
This computer exists for you to design an outfit for her, and the keys are just eight

762
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,560
giant keys, just like here's blue, here's pink, here's stripes, here's classic Minnie

763
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,800
polka dots.

764
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
This is a fine machine.

765
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
This is a quality machine.

766
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
It's awesome.

767
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Yeah.

768
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,720
And then you say the computer is heart, but other things in the office are heart.

769
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,160
The mirror is a heart, and the dressing, whatever you call that thing.

770
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:31,240
The board that you only used in 40s movies where actresses would change backstage and

771
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,840
drape the dresses over the...

772
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
A screen.

773
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
A screen.

774
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
A dressing screen.

775
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,320
Minnie's dressing screen.

776
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,720
Yeah, so that's a heart as well.

777
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
So she's got an aesthetic.

778
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,200
There's a little heart at the top of the, what would you call it?

779
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,520
I can't think of anything today.

780
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
The shelves.

781
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
There's a little heart.

782
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
So she has hearts everywhere.

783
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,080
I don't think any of us have truly designed an office because we don't know the names

784
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,000
of the things that would go with them.

785
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,080
Desk, a dress.

786
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,640
It's a desk with a shelf above it.

787
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Bureau.

788
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Bureau, no.

789
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Well, that would be...

790
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,000
So her little area is awesome, and in a different picture, she has a chaise lounge there too

791
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
as well.

792
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,360
So she does her stuff.

793
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
She does her business.

794
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,480
She does her work there, and it's a ton, obviously, more personality than Mickey's boring office.

795
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,280
And I also think maybe that office of Mickey's is showing his true personality.

796
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
It's all business.

797
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,920
He doesn't have any whimsy.

798
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
That's all bullshit.

799
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
That's all an act.

800
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,480
He doesn't give a fuck about whimsy and fun.

801
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
The writers write this stuff.

802
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,760
Yeah, they tell me who I am.

803
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
A bunch of nerds.

804
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,760
I had a bunch of guys on goofballs.

805
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
Funny stuff comes out, I guess.

806
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,400
A team of people to put all this shit in here.

807
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,400
I don't know what half this shit is, I don't know where it is.

808
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,840
I just like to see this with Minnie, because it's more what I think Minnie is, and Minnie's

809
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
true to herself.

810
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,280
I think Minnie is more who she is on screen, which is what I like to know and to see.

811
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,360
Totally, but I have to be true to myself.

812
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,680
I frankly am too fond of this den.

813
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,360
I feel like this is something...

814
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,240
This was a thing I got locked in on and brought to the show.

815
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,280
I can't possibly vote against the den.

816
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,360
I would not be mad if it went the other way, but I think I'd be betraying my friend Mickey,

817
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,480
who is also being true to himself.

818
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,600
His hard-edged, all-business nature.

819
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,880
He doesn't need an outfit customizing machine.

820
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,040
He's got one.

821
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
His suit.

822
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,080
He puts on his suit.

823
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,400
He goes to his desk.

824
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
He makes a phone call.

825
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,560
He gets the job done, and that's why I'm locking in Mickey's Den.

826
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,040
Wow.

827
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,760
Mickey's Den.

828
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
But it's not fun.

829
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I'm going Minnie.

830
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah, I'm going Minnie too.

831
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Wow.

832
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
I knew it.

833
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,680
It was kind of a protest vote in a way, but I'm also not...

834
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,040
In the broad scheme of things, I am not at all upset to have this Minnie computer.

835
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,760
I was more sold on the computer by the time I described it out loud than when I started.

836
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,040
If Minnie's job is kind of modeling or being stylish or being fashionable, that's labor.

837
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,560
In women's, what is traditionally called women's work is undervalued.

838
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,160
Certainly from the ball and chain, I've learned quite a bit about styling.

839
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,680
That was one of the best moments.

840
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,160
You're talking about how styling is good to be nice to her, but then you called her a

841
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
ball and chain.

842
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,640
That was the best combo ever.

843
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Well, I was trying to be...

844
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
I meant that affectionately.

845
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
You've been married for several days.

846
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
I thought, yeah, I've been married for seven days.

847
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
She's the ball and chain.

848
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,640
That's a little bit of what Fred Mertz would use to describe...

849
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Yeah, I'm true to myself, goddammit.

850
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
You're in character.

851
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
That's your model of an ideal marriage.

852
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,440
My beloved wife has taught me so much about the ideas that are communicated or stories

853
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,920
that are told with how you dress and stuff, and I read the menswear guy is always dunking

854
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,280
people on Twitter and learning about the history of clothes.

855
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,240
So I'm very interested in this.

856
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Sure.

857
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,580
Well, I agree that Minnie is doing work.

858
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,480
You never heard me say otherwise.

859
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
And it's fun.

860
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
She's got her own place.

861
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
She's her own woman.

862
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
You have never heard me say otherwise.

863
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,040
I've never heard you say otherwise.

864
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
I am on the record.

865
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
I know.

866
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
He voted for Minnie.

867
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
For years.

868
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
I voted.

869
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
If anything, I need to be scolded.

870
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
Yes, Scott needs to be scolded.

871
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Mickey tells stories, too.

872
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
Here's the story.

873
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Dumbo's asking for more money.

874
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Oh, really?

875
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,040
What's the name on the top of the Walt Disney Productions?

876
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,040
And what built that empire?

877
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Me.

878
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
These big ears.

879
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Not your big ears.

880
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Stay in line.

881
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
You're saying Mickey.

882
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
I'll ship you off to Fleischer.

883
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
These lights are too bright in here.

884
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Take the bulbs out.

885
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
I want to be in the darkness.

886
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
The guy who designed this thing.

887
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Get the old light bulbs.

888
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Are you trying to get me migraines?

889
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,600
I want the ones that last three months and then they just explode.

890
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
I don't want this new LED shed.

891
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I want a hole in the floor that can open up when I hit a button.

892
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
And I don't want things powered by windmills anymore, okay?

893
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
All right.

894
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Windmills, ooh.

895
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
They kill birds.

896
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
They kill everything.

897
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I like that about them.

898
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
They kill everything.

899
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
They kill Clara Kluck.

900
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Can't you hear me?

901
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
I can't hear you.

902
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I can't hear you.

903
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I can't hear you.

904
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
I can't hear you.

905
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
I can't hear you.

906
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I can't hear you.

907
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
I can't hear you, sir!

908
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
I can't hear you, sir!

909
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
I can't hear you, sir!

910
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
That's why I don't see her in the cartoons anymore!

911
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
What are you saying?

912
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I was just a good woman!

913
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,280
He made love for many years!

914
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
We get it.

915
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,080
Mickey does not have a good work-life balance.

916
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,700
He sure doesn't.

917
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,160
But we all benefit from it.

918
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
We all benefit.

919
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,680
We get to have fun in his places.

920
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,840
He's kind of, he does it for our sins.

921
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,360
He's kind of a Christ-like figure.

922
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

923
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Mhm.

924
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
It seems like good art to Christ.

925
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Jerky Christ.

926
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,740
I'm sure art that exists, Mickey.

927
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Yeah.

928
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,740
On the cross.

929
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,740
Okay.

930
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,420
I classified both of these as studies. I think that's fair. It's mr

931
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,140
Toad's study from mr. Toad's wild ride and it's Bowser's study from the queue for

932
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,460
Mario Kart

933
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,420
Koopa's challenge. Is that what it is? Is that what the name of the ride?

934
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,660
Is it Bowser's change isn't it somewhere isn't it? But isn't it weirdly Koopa somewhere?

935
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,220
Yeah, well, it's called Bowser's challenge in Japan in Japan. Oh was challenge. So I'm not pulling that

936
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:12,100
Things like we're Eggman is the name of the villain in Japan and it's Robotnik here inside. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think so

937
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:17,300
Yeah, all right. Well, I'm glad Bowser's challenge is here. Yeah foolishness now. I think in the episode

938
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,580
We were talking about this as if it was a Badger's office

939
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:27,460
I mean, I think that's how it was suggested to us, but on reflection it you're in Toad Hall

940
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,980
It's got to be Toad's office and there's paintings of Toad on the wall

941
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,940
Badger's just in there leaning on one of those

942
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:43,540
Yeah bookshelf ladders the lie on wheels and having a hard time of it. He's holding too many books. He's slipping around

943
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Mr. Toad's paintings are

944
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,740
Fantastic. There's one where he seems to be unless I'm just looking at it from a weird warped angle

945
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:57,100
Maybe it's our maybe it's of relatives or something. I feel like I'm looking at a Parisian Toad

946
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:04,020
With like a with a goatee. Yeah a little with the mustache and the little then the little wispy beard

947
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,660
And then I look more of an English more of a stuffy tea drinking

948
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:16,060
Monocle wearing Toad. Yeah, this is a very nice room. It's the first room that you enter in the ride

949
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:22,220
It's where your madcap journey begins. It's a very well decorated bookshelf. There's lots going on on there

950
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,780
There's a ship up at the top. We got globes

951
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,780
There's a lot of items we're gonna see throughout and that might the devil might be in the details here

952
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,220
We might have to we might find ourselves going which is the best globe, which is the best telescope?

953
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:38,400
Yeah, he's also got a pile of papers that have stacked up presumably because he's out

954
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,980
Show boating and racing around instead of getting his work done. Whatever that is

955
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:49,100
I don't really remember much about mr. Toad and what he does besides go on wild rides and take you to hell

956
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,300
Is badger mr. Toad solicitor? I

957
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,580
Couldn't tell you a lawyer maybe oh, maybe oh, yeah. Oh, that's a good question. I don't know

958
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:03,020
He's obviously in the in there doing some sort of research. She's pulling books off the shelf on the big ladder. Yeah

959
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,700
So he's obviously working in some capacity for mr. Toad. Yeah

960
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,020
so

961
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,420
Did you have a reason why you were asking about this? Well now I was just trying to figure out why he's in there

962
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,740
No, I mean, I guess it could be some sort of recreational thing, but I don't it doesn't seem like it. Mm-hmm

963
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,420
Yeah, it's just the feeling I get I think he makes other people do his dirty work

964
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,860
Yeah, I mean, I think boring stuff

965
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:31,020
Everyone's sort of annoyed with Toad because Toad is the one who acts wild and they have to reign him in

966
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,780
You know, like everyone is sort of in like everyone is lower than Toad status wise

967
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,300
But that's the frustrating thing is that he's reckless. Well, and he's a fool. Well, yes, it's a reckless fool

968
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,740
Mm-hmm, but he but he gets his and a lesson that we all learn

969
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,060
Right when we when we are taken to hell just like in in real life. Mm-hmm. All bad people go to hell

970
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,060
That's right. You know this we believe

971
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
then we move to

972
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,900
Bowser's

973
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,380
Study office, whatever you want to call it

974
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:07,260
I think that we have been pretty rough on this ride and I think that this ride has been rough on us frankly

975
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,260
Yeah

976
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,360
So it would be kind of a change of heart to give some shine to something

977
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,880
From the Mario Kart ride and it is very tempting to do so because every

978
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:27,400
Picture you see of this I've only been in this room once because I try to avoid this line and frankly the ride

979
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,220
I've gone back to this very much

980
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,720
I got to do it in like a single rider way where I'm skipping a lot of this stuff

981
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,480
But Mike you and I did it one time and if you're gonna get stuck in a theme park room for a while

982
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,240
This is a good room to get stuck in it is great

983
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,240
I've maybe never seen maybe not never but like it's right. I think it's rare to see

984
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,320
Q with this many details with funny jokes with nods to the vast rich Mario universe

985
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,280
There's so many great book titles. Yeah, he's got blueprints on the wall. You get to see where Bowser

986
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:07,720
Creates his minions like you get a sense of his process of how he designs a bullet bill of how he designs those wind-up toys

987
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,720
like

988
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,000
Like and it's also and he does it all from like a almost religious feeling space

989
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,840
It's like somewhere. It's it feels like a castle obviously, but it also kind of feels like a temple

990
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,680
I mean, it's it's remarkable and I don't think a space that you've I have no idea. There's been a lot of games

991
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,720
Maybe Bowser's office has been shown in the games

992
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,960
But it's not instantly familiar to me, but it answers a lot of questions

993
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,300
It tells me a lot about Bowser's character and I just really like this room. Yes, you're right

994
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:44,180
I mean, there's something that very cathedrally about some of the like windows in there. Yeah. Yes, it is

995
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,700
It really shows off his character as you're saying like there's a there's a pen. There's like a quill there

996
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,420
That's how he writes. Mm-hmm. So like he is a he's a

997
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,620
Dinosaur writes with a quill exactly so you are getting which is important

998
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,220
I think some for the office what Jason was saying earlier you make it your own

999
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,620
Shows your personality off. Mm-hmm, and I think you're absolutely right

1000
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,540
You don't get this glimpse into Bowser's life

1001
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,500
And if you just went through the queue of the Mario Kart ride, you would go. Oh my god

1002
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,700
I'm but this is about to be the greatest ride of all time

1003
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:22,940
Yes, so detailed such a usually with a long detailed queue. You're gonna get a really good ride very rarely

1004
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,900
I feel like is there a ride with this good of a queue that

1005
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:33,500
That not good of a bum people out. Yes. Yeah, perhaps a superior queue to a ride

1006
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,500
I

1007
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,180
Don't want to prolong it. I mean, it's just it's a hard competition

1008
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:45,180
It's a very detailed office, you know, you know a world of IP that I love I'm going Bowser

1009
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:52,140
Yeah, well I the thing about Bowser. He's always kind of monofocused on his goal

1010
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,180
Yeah, right taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. Mm-hmm

1011
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,180
Uh

1012
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,980
Wooing the princess

1013
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,660
Invading a nice way to put it. Yeah, he's using his office a lot. Mm-hmm

1014
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:10,780
He's he's got a lot of business perhaps more than Mickey. I think they have similar workloads

1015
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,780
I think they would actually get along very well. I

1016
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,620
He's the kind of guy you want on your side not to be an enemy maybe new CEO for Disney Bowser

1017
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,260
What do you think replace? I?

1018
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,100
Need a firm and you know, you need somebody doesn't take shit doesn't create her to the woke mob

1019
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:43,020
Traditional values of being openly evil somebody's mad and they criticize just get the airship and fly

1020
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,460
Yeah, I don't know what do you guys think

1021
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,500
Bowser

1022
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,760
Well, I was gonna yeah, I agree Bowser I was gonna say toad toads office isn't crazy enough for toad honestly

1023
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,660
Yeah, it's well, I think I think you get there, you know, there's it's similar, right?

1024
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,460
Egotistical character but that is more evident in the exterior in the building

1025
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,780
Made in his image where his image is shown very much and in the statues of him

1026
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:20,580
And then the grandeur and the pomposity right is you know, they actually these are well paired

1027
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,620
They have a lot in common both green as well

1028
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:30,220
But ultimately I think Bowser's is a more is just a bigger manifestation of the egotistical character

1029
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,620
design wise I think toads office is

1030
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,620
more

1031
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,620
library than office

1032
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,380
Yeah, does that make sense?

1033
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,580
I even had the question putting it in who is it an office and there is a desk so it ends up the desk ends up

1034
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Being kind of the you know the deciding factor

1035
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,020
As it might be in some of these and this is another one where we might have to knock one out before we go

1036
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,300
This is very competitive. But by the way, the next matchup will be

1037
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,660
Intune den's minis office versus Bowser's study. Wow, I like that pairing. Holy shit

1038
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,380
so

1039
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,900
This area I call sci-fi and labs and this is extremely competitive

1040
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,280
I would say we have the MIB headquarters from men in black alien attack

1041
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:23,280
We have the collector's office from guardians of the galaxy mission breakouts in California adventure

1042
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,040
We have what I keep calling the cool girl lab from spaceship earth

1043
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,000
The representation of computer science in the 60s and 70s you have the professor's office

1044
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
From Kingdom of the dinosaurs kind of a little kind of a sleeper

1045
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,880
This is the first scene in this defunct dark ride from Knott's Berry farm

1046
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,760
Right before time travel begins and then you have

1047
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
one of the grandest labs ever made

1048
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
the laboratory in flight of passage

1049
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,360
in Avatar in the world of Pandora

1050
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,640
So one of these has to go

1051
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,520
Do we have to reason it out or do we just pick one? Hmm. I

1052
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,000
Hmm, I've got two that I would put on the chopping block. Okay two on the chop. Okay

1053
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
The

1054
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:22,720
Professor's office from Kingdom of the dinosaur. Mm-hmm. I love whimsy, but I just I never saw I just don't know it as well

1055
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,880
It's hard. It feels hard like doomed. But also when we discovered it in the episode, it's just like it's a fun silly place

1056
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,920
It's got a time machine. Yeah, he's a kooky guy teetering in a chair. Yeah, I do wish I knew it more but he sounds like this

1057
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,360
He's one of these guys. Oh, no, the time machine's not ready and there's a big dial and there's shelves

1058
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,920
I you know to me. It's a little more of an office than

1059
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,320
Pandora than avatar which is so clearly a lab

1060
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,680
It's just so I know that we're allowing labs, but it's so much more

1061
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,160
Other one it's more lab than office and we spend so much time in the second gate. Mm-hmm

1062
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,920
Like scratching our heads about this one. I know I know

1063
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,200
but well

1064
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,440
One move could be deciding now

1065
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:17,960
Labs are out because I don't know that you'd even call it a lab in the in Kingdom of the dinosaurs and you put in doc

1066
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,160
on dar

1067
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Like just make it fair

1068
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
And all labs are out

1069
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:30,080
Yes, all labs are out labs are out. All right. I like the less. Okay, so what this has now become is

1070
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,320
And apologies to the lab, but I do think it's a different category and it's you know

1071
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,440
We got through an entire episode without realizing it perhaps making that episode a waste of time

1072
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,800
No, but now that we're here. No

1073
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,000
Like every episode it's not erased it there is an office in there's another office in

1074
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:59,100
There's the makeshift garage office in in spaceship. I was thinking about that too. Yes. There is the pseudo Steve jobs

1075
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,600
Well, this this throws us for a loop. I mean, I like it and I I think it's a very peaceful zone

1076
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,280
Yeah, I don't want it in here, but it is if you don't want it in here

1077
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,320
Then it shouldn't be in but I like that

1078
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,440
I like that he has a Fleetwood Mac poster in there that is that makes me have it's nice to see very nice to see them

1079
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,200
In a dark red. Yeah. Um, okay, so flight of passages out labs are out. This is now sci-fi

1080
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:27,280
Not labs sci-fi it is and let me throw it into the randomizer so we don't have time to overthink these pairings

1081
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,600
This is a very important step and we now

1082
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,440
Throw it in and we get this

1083
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,460
Okay, the first pairing is men in black

1084
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,360
Versus doc on dars little room in his den of antiquities

1085
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,920
Okay. Well, you know the thing about the doc on our one you go to a small business

1086
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,240
Especially a knickknack shopper an antique store if they got the door to the back open

1087
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,640
You're gonna see a little desk with a stack of papers

1088
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:08,000
Probably an eight-year-old Dell computer and they got to do payroll, you know, they got to pay rent

1089
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,560
They got to do all this stuff

1090
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,920
That said men in black alien attack is so elaborate

1091
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,040
It's a giant bullpen. There is a break room as you exit

1092
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,160
Mm-hmm

1093
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,560
There is technically a lobby even though it's a swerve

1094
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,800
Yes, true, but I think I think you got a judge judge it for office

1095
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,780
And I think mainly and you could take these other things into account, but I think you mainly have to

1096
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,800
focus on that main

1097
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:48,560
room where the most desks are and where there's announcements from ripped horn and

1098
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
You know like arrivals of

1099
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,920
aliens

1100
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:59,240
And that room is a pretty spectacular room. That is a tough one to deny

1101
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,480
What do you think Mike is the one who brought doc on dollar into this very recently?

1102
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,360
I think there's a lot of things like the little alien break room that

1103
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,180
Technically if you're considering the whole thing in office

1104
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,600
That's part of it and look the design of men in black and the way that the office looks is really cool

1105
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
And they've recreated it in a perfect way

1106
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,640
But I think the details and doc on dar if you really take a look

1107
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,240
There's little trinkets. There's things on the wall. There's like these cool weapons that are behind him

1108
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,680
He's got like a big book that he looks through when he's looking for the prices for things

1109
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:39,920
I just think this little zone is one of my favorite parts of Galaxy's Edge. It's the promise of Galaxy's Edge

1110
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,080
It's a new character in the Star Wars universe, and you're it's just a gift shop

1111
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,040
There's no he doesn't need to be in there, but I love peering in here

1112
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,640
For a longer than your average

1113
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,120
Park-goer when I'm in doc on dars and I think

1114
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,760
That this was we as we're saying you get a character you get his personality

1115
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,640
You get what he's all about even though he doesn't really talk. He just looks over and I love it

1116
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,220
And I think I would vote for doc on door over men in black Wow

1117
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:16,320
Well, let me throw out this the men in black bullpen a lot of desks a lot of papers

1118
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:20,740
cups with pens and pencils and that cool oval screen

1119
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,380
The cool again aesthetically very cool and a lot of it

1120
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:33,060
I think for is the excitement of oh wow it's the office from the movie, which is a very well-designed office

1121
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,060
Yeah, but it is

1122
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,540
sterile and

1123
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:45,260
Yes while impressive I just there's there's not as many details in it as you're getting from the hominess of

1124
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,380
the doc on dar space

1125
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,300
I agree with everything that you said in you

1126
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:58,780
I like that we have taken some time to highlight this particular space with it that the den itself is great and the little room

1127
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,900
In the den is the highlight the space is wonderful. I appreciate the passion that said not a chance men in black

1128
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,140
Wow, yeah men in black as well

1129
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:14,060
Potentially go although I really favor I just it's of course everything you said was right. There was not one error

1130
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:19,060
I'm glad that he got some time on this podcast, but there's no way men in black so cool

1131
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,760
I agree men in black so cool. I just got aliens to one more. It's also a unique

1132
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,900
It's like he's in like a you a little UFC cage or like a UFC cage in the middle of his gift shop

1133
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,980
I am glad you highlighted. There's like a weird like abacus thing going on

1134
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,780
System of counting that I mean you're I'm gonna end up talking myself and you focus on even everything else

1135
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,940
I mean like that's sort of above it the different lights the different details

1136
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,100
Yeah, it's cool, but it's isn't well. Maybe it's more of a of a pen and a den

1137
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,720
It's certainly a pen, but it is his office

1138
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,860
That's where he does all his work, and it is lived in and it's and you know what it feels like very

1139
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:01,700
Classically Star Wars does everything Star Wars you want Star Wars to do with like an entire world is

1140
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,480
Implied with it with it isn't really they don't tell you everything it's just like here's cut to this

1141
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:12,900
This feels so real and lived in one of the tries things that still to this day hold up for me as far as galaxies

1142
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,320
I just concerned yeah, but the sterility of men of black

1143
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:21,300
I don't think we've seen sterility a lot and isn't that a big element of

1144
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,700
Real offices, but I also don't find all that sterile. We'll have to well

1145
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,700
You know let's get to it in the next

1146
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,380
Different type of sterility we're talking about we'll see what if it ends up against something more whimsical

1147
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:39,540
Which it undoubtedly will via the next matchup, which is the collector's office and guardians and the professor's office from Kingdom of the dinosaurs

1148
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,740
We could good we could do this for a while or we could do I mean it's pretty obvious

1149
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,600
I'm really happy Kingdom of the dinosaurs is in there, but it's the collector's off. Yeah

1150
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,860
Yeah, no cotton. I'm sorry professor. I really like it

1151
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:00,940
People have asked for a little while about a kingdom of the dinosaurs episode at least on the second gate

1152
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,900
I'd love to do that. Yeah, I'd love to hear this guy's voice more. I'd like to watch the video

1153
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,260
Where Gary Owens goes through the ride?

1154
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,940
with some other guy

1155
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:17,540
We'll we will give proper shine to this professor, but come on. It's yeah the ends unfortunately

1156
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,860
This is a tough. This is a tough category so men in black goes up against Guardian

1157
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,380
Collectors office, which could be a I mean that that feels like it could be the final right there

1158
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:32,420
Well, it's gonna have to get decided before that so that leaves us with kind of the unclassifiable with the grab bag

1159
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:37,540
With the leftovers, but that's no way to put it because some of these are

1160
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,300
pretty damn spectacular

1161
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:46,700
And so I will throw these into the randomizer. Yes one especially. I think we've all been salivating

1162
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,460
over a certain one of these

1163
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,180
So let's do it. It is going to be I think it's the same order that I put in

1164
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,700
All right

1165
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,060
Here's the well. Let's just do the first two

1166
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,940
Tiana's office in the line for Tiana's by Tiana's bio adventure and

1167
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,700
Bluto's office from the line

1168
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,660
For Popeye and Bluto's build rat barges is that correct it is

1169
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,740
Now something funny about this because this was suggested by a listener

1170
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:25,080
And this came up in the pre show that we did on the patreon and something that I thought was very funny

1171
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,380
Was that I just described it because I couldn't get the photo to load

1172
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:36,040
I just said oh, you know what Bluto has an office you guys didn't see a photo sight unseen when I said

1173
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,740
So is it in yeah, it's in no. That's in that'll be in the pop

1174
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:45,900
I love is so strong you didn't even need to see a photograph to know with absolute certainty

1175
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:53,360
Bluto's office it could have been in like eight inch by eight inch drawing in like a little like portal or porthole or something

1176
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,060
And it's just like you've peered in and I would have yeah. Yeah, it's in

1177
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,020
Bluto's office

1178
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:03,680
Doesn't matter could have been a scrambled tiny photograph 50 by 50 pixels

1179
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,620
It's not what it could have been literally an announcement while you're in the line

1180
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:13,640
Describing the office that you never see and I would approve it being in this

1181
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:19,060
Like here's what he has. He's got a desk and he's got a telescope and well

1182
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:26,700
Let's now that now let me show the photo which isn't much better than the quality that you're describing what I did get my apologies

1183
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,900
I don't have it in front of me what a listener sent this but here's what is in

1184
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:38,300
Bluto's office a classic cage off as we find in a lot of these lines. Yeah, we have a desk we have

1185
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,840
Framed photo of himself. Yeah, we have a big yellow trophy

1186
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,180
we have a

1187
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:49,640
Treasure chest and then a bunch of loose treasure

1188
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:55,900
That is piling up and then we have a cannon as a cannon. That's really good

1189
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:03,980
So it is really really good. Yeah framed photo of yourself in the in an office is kind of

1190
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,460
Psychopathic. Mm-hmm. He's bluto

1191
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:14,220
Yeah, he is a traditional keel you want to see him lose you want to see him eat shit the original American Psycho

1192
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,700
That's right. Yeah, that's right. You would say it. Yeah, Patrick Bateman

1193
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,960
I hear they're remaking American Psycho with bluto in that role

1194
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,180
but still

1195
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,560
Still with Christian Bale. He's he is dick Cheney style

1196
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:33,060
Going to style himself as blue. He's slowly turning himself into bluto

1197
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:39,800
No gaining even more weight growing a big beard no one asked him to do that they hired they said no

1198
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,180
This is a voice role. Yeah, you will not be seen

1199
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:48,140
Who is in the new America? Did they and is it Austin Butler? Is that right?

1200
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:52,460
I don't know is it I thought they were remaking or maybe like there was chatter with it

1201
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:59,420
Is there a casting or did you see like more Jacob a little Josh Gadd? I believe did you see some like a I add on

1202
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,740
Facebook that no, no, I thought it was a dead. It might just be in development

1203
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:08,860
I thought maybe there was just names turn around there was a musical too. I don't think they're adapting

1204
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:15,820
There's an Austin Butler announcement. Oh for American Psycho suck. Yeah, okay. Wow. Yeah, I could do yeah, you know

1205
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,220
I'll go a little psycho. Yeah. Yeah, that's right

1206
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,340
so

1207
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:26,580
Bluto's office is pretty it's pretty strong. I have to say it is from saying those items. It's very good

1208
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:35,080
Tiana's office inspired this entire thing and reminded us that we like this area. We're not be here without Tiana

1209
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,860
It's a very there's a very simple just stylish chair. There's a typewriter

1210
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,340
There's a good amount of space despite it being you know, a little corner. It's a solid desk

1211
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:50,120
It's she's got framed photos of of other people people that she cares about

1212
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:57,920
She's got a there's a little table with a box of chocolates and ginger ale aka Jason's go-to lunch

1213
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,040
Tiny cans

1214
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,520
so it's almost on par with the

1215
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,280
Treehouse where you're just like, oh what a perfect space that I a human man

1216
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,920
Yeah, I'd like to sit in and work of all the of a lot of what we've talked about

1217
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:26,520
Yes, this would be high on the list of what I would like to where I would like to go what feels like a

1218
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,600
Productive space right just well chosen a very appealing color of wood

1219
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:37,440
Nice splash is a color and the queue is one of the the things that I think improve

1220
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,800
On Splash Mountain. I think the key of Tiana's is better than Splash Mountain

1221
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,200
Exterior of the queue and this office is a huge part of it

1222
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,360
Yeah, natural light or at least the simulation of natural light

1223
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,280
With artificial lights and the bright. Yeah

1224
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,560
This might be highest on my list of where I think I where if you had to be nice to work out

1225
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,520
To do it get a little bit of work done. It might be here

1226
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,680
Pluto I am even I was calling to me

1227
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,880
I

1228
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:13,240
Wasn't where I started thinking about I like what like when I was staring at this matchup, I'm like it's well, obviously

1229
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,840
It's Tiana. Let's let's be adults here. But then I don't know once I said

1230
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:25,400
The randomizer putting this together. Yes, there's treasure. There's a big can. Did you were you about to vote Tiana? I

1231
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,580
Actually was you were about to betray Popeye. I was you know, T

1232
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:34,900
Well, no, I was gonna defeat Pluto's so if anything I'm honoring

1233
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,780
Where does wimpy's allegiance lie when it comes to Pluto hamburgers?

1234
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,380
His god is hamburgers

1235
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:47,420
He's office and it was just a drawing of wimpy's office. You would have voted wimpy's office, right? Oh, yeah

1236
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,580
Yeah, or even if it was um, oh god, what's a cook's name hard?

1237
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:59,020
Rough house rough house. Yeah, if it was rough houses kitchen. I would went kitchen off kitchen is office

1238
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,660
It's it goes to rough house. You're mad at Pluto. That's partly why you don't want him to win

1239
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:07,540
Yeah, or where does the goon do their business?

1240
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,980
I know look we can list all Popeye characters

1241
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,700
We know when we could hypothetically we could it does sound like the kind of thing that would happen on this podcast

1242
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,140
Yeah, yeah might have happened already

1243
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:20,700
Yes, but keep in mind the longer you go within I'd say five you would ruin it

1244
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:25,500
You would run into one that is completely wrong and those years would comment that you are wrong about this pop

1245
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,300
Okay, see Hags we work

1246
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:33,060
Great. There's something there. Yeah, so blue. So yeah blues. I

1247
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,940
Don't know the thing I was about to say is gonna would tip a potential other matchup. So I won't even say

1248
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,820
Yeah, no, let's save any you know, it's hard that there's a can there's a cart and here's also important

1249
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,300
Yeah, it's not a practical looking cannon. It looks like a drawn cannon

1250
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:54,380
That's the thing that makes it extra appealing is because so much of this is rendering things from a cartoon in real space like Bowser

1251
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:59,260
It's like yeah, they actually made it look like to scale of what he looked like in the real world

1252
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:06,740
This looks like a cartoon cannon a cartoon treasure chest and in the same way that Minnie's office is so appealing

1253
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:12,380
This is so appealing. This is why I'm voting for Pluto realism kind of goes against

1254
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:18,100
I don't know. Sometimes it's not not the most fun to boat. He's got a big trophy, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's great

1255
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:23,100
He sure does I'll make sure that this photo is distributed. So you all have it in front of you, right?

1256
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,780
But we move now to the next one

1257
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:34,400
Maybe the most interesting matchup in the entire affair the daily bugle from the amazing adventures of spider-man and island islands of adventure

1258
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,580
versus the

1259
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,140
oval office in conservative pollsters

1260
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:45,300
conservative pollster Frank Luntz's house now if you didn't hear the pre episode

1261
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:51,900
You might be very confused as to how we got here. Well, we got here because the the spider-man ride

1262
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:57,500
I guess a lot of people like and then obviously Frank Luntz's house was right sure shot from the beginning

1263
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,980
We there was a discussion of I threw out at the end of the of the pre episode on the second gate

1264
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,900
Do we need to honor that across this country?

1265
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:12,340
There are a lot of fake oval offices exact recreations of oval offices typically in presidential libraries

1266
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,520
There's a number of those it seemed like a good category to honor Mike

1267
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:22,120
You somehow had the fact in your head that conservative pollster Frank Luntz has an oval office in his house

1268
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:27,280
Do you had that locked it you had that somewhere back in the recesses? Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's something

1269
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,960
I don't know when I learned about it

1270
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,320
there was definitely a period of time when I watched a lot of like MSNBC and

1271
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,800
I guess to some degree CNN and Fox News to see what was going on

1272
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,360
It was very I knew all the players

1273
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,120
I still seem to know a lot of the play

1274
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,880
I don't watch a lot of that anymore because why would you watch any of it? But I

1275
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,120
Yes, Frank Luntz is a guy who is on these shows

1276
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,040
He's he's on Fox News a lot and then he's on that he comes on the liberal ones to like once in a while

1277
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,320
represents the conservative POV

1278
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:03,840
Yes, and I feel like he often does those very annoying polls focus group

1279
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,920
Yes, does he do the folks?

1280
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:12,800
Yes, where he's sitting on one side and then there's ten people and and you are reminded that the median voter in America is insane

1281
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:19,680
Like someone like an old woman will just come out and go like there should be universal income. We're a country of plenty

1282
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:25,760
Also, every teacher should be fucking strapped every teacher should be armed

1283
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,520
But we should all have government health care and you're like what?

1284
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,160
What what is your life? Yeah, what are you doing now?

1285
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,880
This is it is on us more than ever to try to take away

1286
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,400
The character of who's in the office because in a world where we've got

1287
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:48,280
Indiana Jones one of our favorite characters on earth and it's kind of impossible to untangle here

1288
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,280
We have a guy who frankly I didn't know about before

1289
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,200
Now the thing I made a point of not learning more because I don't want it to be about him

1290
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,640
I want it to be about his office

1291
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:04,040
We also learned in this episode that there's a number of unusual things in his house

1292
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,800
I kept going and looking at more. Yeah, one of them being

1293
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,880
that

1294
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:19,440
He has a bunch of written accounts of from people who were physically present when babe Ruth

1295
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,200
Called his shot when he pointed and then hit the home run where he pointed

1296
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:32,520
He's got a bunch of people and then I looked up and I saw he pointed and I said why what for was he pointing out?

1297
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,360
A criminal stealing a purse in the crowd, but sure enough knows where he's gonna hit a home run

1298
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,240
And sure as hell he did seems like should be in a Library of Congress

1299
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,840
Indiana Jones would say they belong to me

1300
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,240
I wish this was the matchup. Maybe we can get it. I was gonna say if he wins

1301
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,040
if the

1302
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,600
Indiana Jones versus Frank Luntz

1303
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,600
All right

1304
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,800
Here we go

1305
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,840
Daily bugle. All right, let's go through the daily bugle

1306
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:12,000
This is a full not just an office but an office building one that has aged

1307
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,940
Properly when it started it was a newspaper

1308
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,600
Office in the 90s then newspapers went out of fashion and now it's a perfect

1309
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:30,240
Anachronistic setting of late 90s newspapers and you got file folders

1310
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:36,840
You've got the newspaper bullpen. You got a darkroom. You've got loading. You've got everything in here

1311
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,560
including one of my

1312
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:48,120
Unseen holy grails that weird silver statue of J Jonah Jameson in the overflow queue

1313
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,680
All right. Well, I can make lists too. You've got Kennedy's desk

1314
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,400
but Obama's chairs and George W Bush's side tables and

1315
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,960
Every president since Truman is represented in this greatest hits oval office

1316
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,540
It's kind of the oval office that never was he's even got a buck stops here sign

1317
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,320
When you enter the room a curtain opens up and hail to the chief plays

1318
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,840
This is and keep in mind, you know, they have to dress things up for us in a theme park

1319
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:26,000
They've got paying customers in there, but you know Frank, this is his home. He didn't have to do that production value

1320
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:33,320
Right. He's just having run-of-the-mill folks over, you know, like Clint Eastwood Warren Beatty Tim Allen and Tony Blair

1321
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,920
He's just having salt of the earth people over maybe just to have a dinner in a chat and he gives them a little show

1322
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,560
And makes them reflect for a minute about the great history of the great men who run this country

1323
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,400
That's something this is a dangerous

1324
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,240
He should go to the El Salvador prison. We cannot trust this man in the light society

1325
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,440
Well, it seems suddenly you you all don't want to talk about Tim Allen as much as he usually do

1326
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,080
well, that's I do but

1327
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:10,380
He also you know 45 minutes out of episode, you know, obviously there's like fun whimsy and spider-man's cue

1328
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:16,520
But obviously Frank also like in his area has Colonel Clink's outfit from Hogan's heroes

1329
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:22,300
So he's a fan of movies TV and music as well. So it's you're getting sort of an else world's

1330
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,780
Where Colonel Clink is hanging out with the president's?

1331
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,220
You might say in Frank Luntz's overall Frank Luntz has his own universe

1332
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:41,900
Okay, the Daily Bugle has my other friends Betty Brandt

1333
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:47,120
Robbie whose last name I forget Ben Eurek J Jonah Jameson

1334
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,780
Yes, but but that's the office

1335
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:54,860
I want to visit and live in but Frank when his mother died

1336
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,780
He thought about how in his rise in politics

1337
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:04,580
He was never able to take his dear mother to the Oval Office despite all the access that he got

1338
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:12,020
And so when she died he thought what better way to honor her memory than to do a full-scale

1339
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:17,940
Multi-million dollar recreation of the Oval Office in my house. Wouldn't mom be proud?

1340
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:25,060
Troubling it's trouble. Okay, it is troubling

1341
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:31,940
Political views are wrong. But I tried I don't even know what they are. That's how much I am lock it

1342
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:38,820
I've locked myself out of whatever the hell this guy's like a decorum Republican guy. We're like mr. Trump in his rudeness that being said

1343
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:44,820
Yeah, he likes still he's just just to trump to you know, you're like a Lincoln project

1344
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:53,780
Fully Lincoln project, but that's another discussion as a man who has a big collection me

1345
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,140
Michael I have to appreciate

1346
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,860
the effort into

1347
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,860
recreating something you love

1348
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,140
not with a budget of a theme park, but a

1349
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,540
budget of a humble pollster a humble

1350
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,900
Humble newsman Brentwood living

1351
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:17,020
pollster yes, is this the episode where eight years and I finally burst into tears

1352
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:25,580
Mike Mike and I are mostly talking to each other while we do this and then we will turn over and see Jason's face and

1353
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:33,220
Your face is like shrunk as we like so much are you scrunching that it feels like your features are smaller in your head

1354
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:41,020
Because you're glaring so much. I already have the deal like social media this year has been like oh and then wicked wicked

1355
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:48,140
Okay, that could be dr. Doom could be wicked launching and the defying gravity on the Incredible Hulk coaster

1356
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,140
and that is that's like

1357
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:56,420
Rotten Disney brain of like just call them rotten to even suggest that dr. Doom becomes

1358
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:02,180
I think doing a hit move like box office hit of the year and

1359
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,220
transforming

1360
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:10,020
26 year old watt rides is insane when they're full of expansion pads at Universal parks

1361
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:15,920
That's my thing, but I'm like the thought of losing my friends spider-man and the X-Men. I'm like

1362
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
Might be the thing that

1363
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,920
Start going falling down

1364
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,160
You know, I don't want to I don't want to cause that

1365
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,480
Manipulate me right now into voting for spider-man without working out my feelings about Frank Lutz

1366
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:36,200
He is holding me hostage right now with his mental health

1367
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,200
Yes, it is I think it's it's insidious quite frankly

1368
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:47,640
Yeah, yeah the hobgoblin in that ride for whatever reason I'm doing

1369
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,120
Keep guests like girl boss to you

1370
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,160
Trying to get what I want

1371
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,480
That is what he's trying to do and it's we've never had a situation in a Final Four like this before where I am being

1372
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,760
manipulated into not

1373
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:05,080
Express I'm just expressing thoughts. We needed to work this out in case Frank Lutz doesn't go any further

1374
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:11,200
We have to do we need this this needs to be a safe space for holding space if that terms even still allowed

1375
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,760
Or if it needs to Frank goes against your expansion. I

1376
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,440
Unlike are the present I will honor the votes of this election

1377
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:25,980
So, you know, I'm throwing my hat in for the Daily Bugle you guys can say whatever you want and I'll honor it

1378
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,080
Okay, whether win or lose the balls in our court now Frank

1379
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,120
Chicken Frank Luntz and J Jonah Jameson are similar types of people in a way

1380
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,620
I think they would appreciate each other's impact in the measures of spider-man right, but politically I bet they align

1381
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,880
Let's be honest at least on a lot of issues

1382
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,360
You know run for office in the past been mayor of New York the Kingpins been mayor of New York

1383
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,400
Matt Murdoch's been district attorney, of course, of course

1384
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,320
Yes, so I don't I don't know where he lies

1385
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,600
Probably more median voter J. Jonas Jameson probably would be in the type of Franklin's focus groups. That's probably right

1386
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,880
There's a lot of great little

1387
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:15,020
Things about spider-man, you know, it says like Ditko place, you know, there's little references

1388
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,520
Spider-man's creators only match up in on earth

1389
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:24,920
I think where you would not be just like frothing with spider-man excitement. This is the only this is

1390
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,080
Like how did it land here? I don't know. That's just the happens. That's happenstance

1391
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,200
Look Mike's role on the show. One of them is he's just asking questions

1392
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,800
Yes, I am. Yes, and I try to work things out

1393
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,520
I don't want it. I don't always want to just go I you know what you guys are going with your guts today

1394
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,800
I'm not I'm going with my brain. I'm going with my thoughts not my belly. So what are you gonna go with?

1395
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:58,480
Now look now the curtain the curtain slides back choose your favorite Michael

1396
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
Scott

1397
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:09,040
That doesn't help yeah, that's a one-way ticket to Huntsville I am being emotionally manipulated here

1398
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:15,320
Frank Jones owns a recreation of Monica Lewinsky's blue dress. That is true again

1399
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:21,660
Doesn't he own something that the Beach Boys used to record pet sounds? Yes. Yeah. Yeah some filth some box. I don't know

1400
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,460
Equalizer imagine you could record an amazing

1401
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:32,100
Classic album in the Oval Office that is well, this is changes the rule like that changes

1402
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:38,820
The scenario it's not just the president's it's it's the different thing. Imagine they record a Beach Boys album in the Oval Office

1403
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:46,540
That's reality in Franklin's most likely to happen in 2025 and it's ever been before

1404
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:51,080
They record it quite a bit in the Oval Office. It's called the Nixon tape

1405
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:59,360
Listen to my wild-haired brother Dennis, I like what you're saying dick aren't as good

1406
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,460
That guy knew Manson can't trust him lock him up. I

1407
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,060
I think the spider-man ride is held up

1408
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:16,940
Just amazingly the updates they've done to it. It's still one of the top three five rides on the planet Earth

1409
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,940
He just won another award. It's such a good legacy

1410
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,660
The queue isn't as fun as though like the queue is really good

1411
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,420
The ride is amazing. I love the ride

1412
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,380
But how crazy are we

1413
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,980
How crazy are we is the question

1414
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,220
Just gonna stare each other in the eyes figure it out. Normally I would edit out this long

1415
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:49,660
Are we gonna go no, no, this is but I know that I think is it's real. This is real

1416
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,360
It's real. This is I gotta look we gotta look each other in the eyes

1417
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,960
Jason is racing as if his plane is going down. He's holding. I think the audience is too

1418
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,760
I think the you will never see a bigger turn

1419
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:05,600
Well, as we talk Scott now as we talk I start to feel powerful

1420
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,840
I'm starting to Mike is like

1421
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:17,280
Finally John Cena turns heel on Cody Rhodes. Oh, he'll Michael power flowing through my body right now

1422
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,600
I

1423
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,040
Is like the rock and he's just dragging his finger my eyes are closed

1424
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,760
My eyes are closed and I am ready to ascend to a higher plane

1425
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,400
As I make one of the most important decisions of my life, not just this show

1426
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,280
What am I going to choose?

1427
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,360
Frank Luntz's

1428
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,360
oval office recreation or

1429
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,920
the spider-man queue for miles of adventure

1430
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,840
Which one

1431
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:54,280
Which one air dripping with tension, so it's all I choose

1432
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,840
This is gonna be the final I think either way the final two the final two

1433
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,800
It's just we just have to make the toughest call

1434
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,760
We're gonna breeze through the rest, but we're making the toughest one the toughest call right now, unfortunately

1435
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,000
That's just how this works. Sometimes when we do these I

1436
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I

1437
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,360
I'm going to choose

1438
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,720
What do you think I know what you're gonna say you're gonna say Frank Luntz's

1439
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,160
That what do you think I'm gonna say I don't think I know either

1440
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,560
Jason thinks I think I know chance that you last-minute beer that you see you

1441
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:38,000
Since Spidey in your heart and I think you've been wearing that hot stuff the little devil t-shirt a lot

1442
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:45,920
Mmm, and some of his wiliness has rubbed off does Frank Luntz have a life-size hot stuff the little devil in his offices

1443
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,040
I don't know. We don't know. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take his collection and stuff out of there. You gotta think so

1444
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:57,480
Yeah, it's all in the office. You can't bring things from his other rooms in you can't bring his babe Ruth letters in here

1445
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,080
Yeah, cuz doesn't have a mini mart or a supermarket or yeah

1446
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:07,960
No, and Frank's market doesn't count and Frank's diner doesn't count either all the things in this bad man

1447
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,960
's house

1448
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,600
But he could bring things into the office and then they're part of it it's here's the thing also

1449
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:23,400
It's not static like these other offices. He can move things around that gives an advantage to more likely to yes to update things

1450
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,520
Items from you know, each each new horrendous president who is elected

1451
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:37,520
Coke button or the or the basket of poise right that makes it special that makes it modular that makes it a different

1452
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:43,640
Type of experience that's unlike any of the other experiences on this list and an experience will never have unless

1453
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:48,200
This episode causes us to get invited to Frank Luntz's house. We are going to the house

1454
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:54,140
Once this episode comes out. No one has talked about this dumb office as much as we have

1455
01:23:54,640 --> 01:24:02,520
It was a Hollywood reporter article from 2016 and no one knows dormant ever since right and for some reason I know I saw

1456
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,640
News show where he's giving a tour of it when oh my god

1457
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:10,840
And then you said the phrase and I've just been in love ever since there's been little heart the hearts of

1458
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,200
Hearts of flutter next to my head ever since this magical phrase was said but I'll say this we've talked about it

1459
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,240
so much so that I think I

1460
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:25,400
Think the chunk we've done now on it is enough to get us invited as I vote for spider-man Wow Wow

1461
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,780
Well, then I will say to honor all of this

1462
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,240
That I I think like I will use my vote to honor not Frank Luntz the man

1463
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:43,580
But Franklin says oval office okay his house. It's not about him. It's about the desk. It's about the horse riding statue

1464
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,900
It's not about his American flag shoes, which are unfortunate

1465
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,820
And I think if I'd shown you that right before I would have

1466
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,340
Deeper into spider-man viewpoint might call those a very

1467
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,300
disrespectful

1468
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,060
Flag every day

1469
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,280
Trump requires America. He wants people to have red white and blue in their hair

1470
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:11,420
That's the preferred uniform these days that must boy took a shit on the carpet go go scoop it up with their

1471
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:17,340
Alright well that finally completes the spacious 16

1472
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:22,740
It was certainly spacious in the amount of time we took to talk about it. I Mike I thank you for creating that tension

1473
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:28,060
And friend for you know giving this the strange discovery a little bit of shine

1474
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:32,140
But I think we call for breaks in the episode if we were gonna

1475
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:36,380
Yeah, we can't break let's put one here, and when we come back the ergonomic eight

1476
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,940
Okay, we are back now

1477
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:41,260
fake office funnel for for the

1478
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,380
ergonomic eight

1479
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:49,260
Nice and pared down. You know we're not as spacious as it was and I I like where we focused

1480
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,260
I think this is a very strong

1481
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:57,060
You know all jokes aside. I think this is the right group of eight. I feel good about it

1482
01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:00,320
I do think that we should do the mental exercise in the other categories

1483
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:04,960
Could lunch have beat it I I know yeah question

1484
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,620
We can ask of a number of these because it would just it would just be interesting to know

1485
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:18,680
I agree, so let's start with back in the territory of jungle makeshifts where we landed it the daughter's observatory and adventureland treehouse versus

1486
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,920
Indiana Jones's office

1487
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,120
Okay

1488
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,720
Let's I think now we really got to put in the end of the microscope and details

1489
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,680
Become important and that's something people liked to point out

1490
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:38,680
When this was brand new was the life magazine is a life magazine from the 30s with Mickey Mouse on the cover

1491
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:45,160
There's you know with all of these with the jungle makeshifts. It just kind of becomes. He has a lot of stuff

1492
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,440
Yeah, maps they sure do got maps there. They are

1493
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,500
Is there a telegram or a message from?

1494
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,400
What's this?

1495
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,760
Sala or the guy in the white suits that always show up in them like his

1496
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:07,440
His guy is minder is fixer. I'm not sure I'm not sure Paul

1497
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,120
The character in the first movie what are we talking about Paul was the guy who plays Ivan ooze

1498
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,120
Yes, actually all freeze you don't know Paul free no no

1499
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,840
I can't think of his name. I don't know Paul something right I have a news. Yeah, I think there's something like that

1500
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,400
Paul Freeman close

1501
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:33,080
Fre I was completely wrong you've got a crate that says delivered a club obi-wan the outches

1502
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:38,600
Temple of doom yes, they yes not a club our wars reference, but with the meander in

1503
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,880
Anything goes performance yes, yes, right yeah

1504
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:50,880
Let's see you know you got a you got maps you got bulletin board you got stuff in that that Mara temple language

1505
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:58,400
You know a lot of details good easter egg II stuff his professorial side is represented

1506
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:07,200
Meanwhile adventure land tree house just like just such a relaxing space real sense of wonder there

1507
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,320
Yeah

1508
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,560
It's uh

1509
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,880
Yeah, what can I say? It's just it's it's just really nice

1510
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:19,480
Splashes of color that I think me I think the color makes it stand out among the other jungle makeshifts

1511
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:25,640
I think that's why I sort of cut through yeah past everest and the like let's talk about vibes though

1512
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:32,320
I mean, Indiana Jones. Yes, the office might have a lot of interesting things in it, but

1513
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,600
Looks a little depressing to actually maybe work there

1514
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:43,760
It looks cool from the context of it being in a ride or a movie, but if you were actually using it as an office

1515
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:49,040
It's got dim light you'd want to put out more lights in there. You want to organize things a little bit better

1516
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,760
Mm-hmm eventually tree house is ready to go ready to use you could walk right in there bring your computer start working no problem

1517
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,200
Mm-hmm, which I think is a strike in its favor and to

1518
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:05,320
Observe the stars and I don't think I realized how many telescopes

1519
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:09,320
We were running to Bowser has one this has one and a fun

1520
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,840
Gilligan's Island one right as if a professor and

1521
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:21,160
Invention and I don't know. It's it's gonna get it's inventive. Yeah in Indiana Jones. It's got that old fan there

1522
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,200
Well, it might here too

1523
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:28,440
I don't know where this tree house is meant to live but that could be an incredibly humid jungle atmosphere

1524
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:33,780
But maybe I don't know the canopy might be just right. It might be the most comfortable room in the house

1525
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:39,100
From what I could tell again, I haven't been to this in person. Did it strike you at all?

1526
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:44,340
When you were there or was this just like a room that you walked through among others the whole thing

1527
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,940
I strikes me and this was one of the specific rooms that I liked

1528
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:52,500
Okay, especially when you do this walk through this this tree house at night at Disneyland

1529
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:58,380
And you get to see how you can you see the views of Disneyland which are perfect if you get a nice sunset

1530
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,900
That's even better

1531
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:04,940
But then you get to yeah look at the different rooms and I this one specifically did did stand out to me on the

1532
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:11,020
Couple times that I've done it. I am willing to right now say it's the observatory in the tree house and I'm surprised

1533
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:15,680
That I'm saying that because I just didn't know it and I'm glad it was

1534
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:22,140
Suggested I had to like go on a little thing for what is the office but it's this and maybe observatory

1535
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:27,700
I guess labs are out but observatories are in I'm fine with that and I think it's very nice. I'm going with that

1536
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:33,020
Hmm, I just think even without the presence of dr. Jones

1537
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:37,500
His as the kids say aura is so strong

1538
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:45,700
the vibes are so good and you think about how Indiana Jones like whips out books or maps or

1539
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:53,900
Diagrams and doesn't even hesitate just so confidently uses stuff and that's why it's all laid out as it is

1540
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:59,060
Mm-hmm. Well, it's just it's uh, it's not there's no real rhyme or reason for the layout

1541
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:03,440
So I think he brings the rhyme and reason

1542
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:08,380
He knows exactly what he's looking for and where it is makes sense in his head

1543
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,500
I mean, I like the idea of a character being

1544
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:13,300
Evident in the way that they have set up their office

1545
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:19,120
I think you find that that you know, the whatever takes it all the way that might be a facet of it

1546
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,780
so I

1547
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,780
Think I have to go with Indiana Jones

1548
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:29,540
But I know I'm waiting a lot of the what do they call it the intangibles?

1549
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:34,820
I'm gonna pull that sports term. I only have understand the intangibles

1550
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:40,700
Are in play at Indy's make sure you can't quantify or qualify. Yeah vibes

1551
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:45,320
Yeah, I mean kind of like Frank's office. Yeah like Frank's office

1552
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:50,700
Yeah, big good vibes in there if it was Indiana Jones was Frank's office. I would have voted Frank's office. What about another one?

1553
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:54,260
I'm voting treehouse treehouse

1554
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,780
Interesting about that. I think it's the way to go

1555
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,780
I think actually, you know, sometimes you want to vote for like a

1556
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:07,860
foundational office in the area like in jungle makeshifts as I said, but this feels like a good evolution like a

1557
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:16,020
You know it shows what they can do now and how good this the set design and production design of these spaces is when they let

1558
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:19,500
Imagineers in the town of people who work there go nuts

1559
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:27,500
People love it when a 16 seed knocks out a one seed, you know, that's right. I think it is Indiana Jones a one you think

1560
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,140
Just from the fame of the occupier maybe

1561
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:40,660
That's true a neon Jones a very famous character the daughter. Is this is it Swiss family? Well, it's

1562
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:47,800
Inspired by it's not it's a different family different family. Do we have names here? I don't think so. I forget though

1563
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:54,900
I don't remember specifically if there are interesting. This is probably in a three ring binder on a shelf in

1564
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,780
Imagineering there's a whole better story

1565
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:05,160
Yeah, it better be just like there's pages and pages of port of entry lore that may be lost to time

1566
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,580
Mm-hmm. Well, well why you got to break into Universal creative and get your hands on it

1567
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:13,800
You have to pull in Indiana. I need to grab a box of floppy disk

1568
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:20,960
Then I need to find a floppy disk reader that I need to find a floppy disk reader that can convert to USB C

1569
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,640
Oh, man, if taking you so long to put that printer together, you know, get that floppy disk drive Michael

1570
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:32,800
That's what I'm saying. I'm fucked. Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back to Pennsylvania and get my college desktop booted up

1571
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,900
Does that still exist? Oh, yeah, it's still got the snakes on a plane background

1572
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,120
Three custom backgrounds for your desktop

1573
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,560
I don't think get snake fever

1574
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:51,440
I don't think the countdown clock to snakes on a plane works anymore because it's long release

1575
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:58,440
You won't want this mother bun mother bleepin desktop off your mother bleepin a computer

1576
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,560
All right, that's so winner of jungle makeshift

1577
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,160
So eventually on tree house kind of surprising but I really like it once you when you really look at it when you study

1578
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,780
It and that takes us to tune dens

1579
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:20,260
Minnie's office versus Bowser's study God who um, I

1580
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,260
There's there like

1581
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,260
Let me just shout out some other

1582
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:32,580
Details in Bowser that I think are neat if there's just good books throughout

1583
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:36,620
A brief history of Moo Moo Meadow jumped out at me

1584
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:43,300
It's a lot of it's just like he's like not only is he just trying to win at Mario Kart he is like

1585
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:50,820
boning up on the entire history of it despite like he must have been like fundamental in the like

1586
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:56,560
Making of it, right? Maybe not. I don't know what in the creation of the

1587
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:04,780
Official what race organization that Mario Kart is a part of? Yeah, you would think I mean, he's always been one of the one of the primary

1588
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:08,680
He's always been in the in the eight in that elite eight. He has that's true

1589
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:15,740
But I guess he could just have be an invited guest to compete in it. It's true

1590
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:19,020
That's true doesn't necessarily mean that he's part of the board. Yeah, I

1591
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,860
Probably not know they probably try to keep him away

1592
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:26,340
But maybe there is a sort of a peace offering to him to allow him to compete

1593
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:31,460
That's the way I'm thinking about it off the top of my head. Yeah, but I don't know

1594
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:37,220
But I just like that it's that there is a vast library with so many like

1595
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:43,540
These are rare rewards in a truly punishing line not in terms of detail and cool stuff

1596
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:48,900
But in terms of length and if you're gonna make people stand in a line like that, and then the only ride they get is meh

1597
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:56,620
Then you know these books are a real treat the art of balloon battle why good things happen to bad people

1598
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:59,560
I like that. They're all big old thick ones

1599
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,280
They are these aren't half chubs. They're full chubs of books and it's

1600
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:11,040
Yeah, it's it's just I don't know into as far as this this queue. I think really competes with

1601
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,200
Mickey minis runaway railway in terms of stuff details

1602
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,480
Yeah

1603
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:21,360
Stop and look at that are worth taking pictures of that make it worth actually doing the queue at least once right?

1604
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:27,960
Yes, is this throne is that chair in the office or my my geography wrong?

1605
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,080
There is a throne

1606
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,540
I'm looking at a really specific photo the one I'm looking at as a big like creepy

1607
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:39,040
Furnace that kind of has a face and tusks and I like that one like the furniture when they can get like the decor of

1608
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,720
A place to feel like the character and they definitely do here

1609
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:47,760
Big throne. I'm not sure there's a bit like there's a big like work desk

1610
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:54,160
I just love that they like that it elaborates on the history of that he that he he's the god of all of these

1611
01:36:54,160 --> 01:37:01,880
Villains, yeah, he made the I was okay. Help me out. Who are the little characters from Mario 2 who wear the little masks and cloaks? Oh

1612
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:09,120
Oh great question. Not the shy guys. No, no shy guys guys are in the other unless I think I'm there

1613
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,160
You're shy. I think are you thinking of shy guy?

1614
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:14,360
Well, here's the I what I wanted you to regardless of who I'm thinking of

1615
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,640
I wanted you to say shy guys and to help me out because I swear to god

1616
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,840
I was about to say try guys. I was so close to saying and Bowser created the try guys

1617
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:27,680
These are the shy guys. I think yeah, that's what I mean. Yes them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, wait. No, wait

1618
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,680
Oh wait, show me again. No, you're showing me

1619
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:37,160
You're showing me three guys on a couch making the scariest apology video you've ever seen in your life

1620
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:43,080
No, that's not from that's a different one shy guy that was filmed making out with Birdo

1621
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:50,600
Who was a food bird? Oh, how could he resist that big luscious mouth?

1622
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,760
Who doesn't want to spin with Birdo?

1623
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:01,080
Birdo, um, they were at a they try to think they were at an Iggy cut. They were at an Iggy Koopa concert

1624
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,080
How could they resist

1625
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,200
Many okay, there's not as much room

1626
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,400
Sadly because there's so many details in Bowser

1627
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:18,760
So many just doesn't have the luxury of space there. I will like to point out that on the screen

1628
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,160
I don't think we talked about this

1629
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:27,240
Of Minnie's computer her heart-shaped computer you were saying it's a lot of it's done for fashion like her fashion work

1630
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,160
But on the computer it says Minnie's email

1631
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,000
Oh

1632
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,920
Now this I made an assumption here

1633
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:41,400
I thought that this was a fashion design thing or like it's because it's for literally it's for kids like to for to paint her

1634
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,760
Right, but what is it? Wait, show me this again. So it says Minnie's email

1635
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:49,880
Yeah, and it'll have her friends Mickey Mouse Donald Duck Goofy

1636
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,880
Daisy duck, I almost said Daffy

1637
01:38:53,960 --> 01:39:00,920
Chippendale Uncle Scrooge and Roger Rabbit. Those are the characters on here and then you know, she's deleted that email

1638
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,880
Nobody taught we don't talk to that guy anymore with Roger

1639
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,680
He's spielbergs

1640
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:12,280
He's blocked the email does say mouse look instead of outlook

1641
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,960
Look

1642
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:19,960
They're trying to get kids accustomed to working man get them into the office early

1643
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,480
Neon

1644
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:30,520
I like that tone. I like that bit. Yeah, so each each character has a different color and or pattern

1645
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:37,160
Correspond so that is also how Minnie's computer works. It's a good idea. By the way, it's a color code of friends

1646
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,320
right, so she's got like

1647
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:43,960
Roger is green Uncle Scrooge is blue is darker blue Goofy's like blue

1648
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,820
Chippendale are stripes her technological innovations

1649
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:53,080
Make me want to give her more right and she's also got a picture of herself

1650
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:57,160
Like like bluedo does she has a picture of herself on the screen for some reason

1651
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,880
Waving I don't know why

1652
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,520
She would does that mean an empty inbox?

1653
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:08,120
Is that he cleaned it all out I think this is just the address book part of the email

1654
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,920
Did Minnie invent her own clippy that is her?

1655
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,280
Oh, maybe because if so, then this is one of the most innovative computer systems ever made. Yeah

1656
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,600
So I just want to yeah

1657
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:24,760
So so she can do all sorts of work with that interesting keyboard is what i'm assuming from this

1658
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,400
Okay. Well, thank you for the correction and for the enlightenment. It is not just for fashion design

1659
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:33,080
It's not just you can email scrooge mcduck. That's right. Um

1660
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,800
I also want to shout out this little area which is like the shes lounge by the window here

1661
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:45,160
That is a nice little area. Yeah as well because like but now let me let me say this though

1662
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,360
That's that's true

1663
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:53,240
But we're now we're a little bit more in like she fits some home office into more of like a parlor a makeup room a bedroom

1664
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:57,800
Perhaps but now but this is also we you know, this was pre

1665
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:03,400
Zoom this was her carving out space for a home office where there wasn't necessarily space

1666
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,920
So she was kind of a pioneer in that way. Yes

1667
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,640
so

1668
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,560
Ultimately

1669
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:17,000
If minnie had the real estate that bowser does I feel like she would handily beat him

1670
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:22,360
But sadly because she doesn't I I you have to give it to bowser. I think okay jason

1671
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,080
Uh, i'm thinking bowser too again. He's very mono

1672
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:34,440
Focused on what he does. He's got personal attachments. He seems to be working on bettering himself though

1673
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:40,840
So that reading educating that's endearing him to me. Why do good things happen to bad people?

1674
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:47,640
You know, there's kind of like it's not just he's not just treating it like a race like there's um, you know

1675
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:53,880
There's a psychological study in it for him. Yeah, if we think of office is as

1676
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,040
Where people are doing their business doing their thing

1677
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,480
I think it's bowser because minnie like mickey

1678
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,560
um

1679
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,680
Might be kind of a cipher in many ways

1680
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:13,400
You put up those are fighting words like no like she can do any

1681
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:21,400
She's a scuba diver then she's a model then she's an explorer then she's a you know you paint

1682
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,960
Stuff onto

1683
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,560
these characters

1684
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:32,760
You know bowser do multiple things though too bowser can do multiple things, but he usually comes back to center

1685
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:39,880
Back to his normal his true love his true life of villainy something that something I think we should all love and admire about

1686
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,400
many is her versatility

1687
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:45,080
Well, yeah, that's true. I for one celebrate that but maybe that's just me

1688
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:49,480
That's just me too. I just I celebrate many and all the different things. She's all right. All right

1689
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:52,120
You have maybe that's just how I see things and how I view women

1690
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,400
But I like that they can do whatever they put their mind to

1691
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:59,080
Yeah, so I but I look at bowser. I have to go with bowser bowser

1692
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,200
Bowser crushes mini

1693
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:09,560
I didn't expect it coming in. All right, we yeah me neither. I know I didn't think I had to even go like there is a

1694
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:14,200
Office in there, right? And once you meditate on it, it's pretty it's pretty undeniable one

1695
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:20,600
Okay, we go to the sci-fi category men in black versus guardian collectors office shit

1696
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,720
Yeah, tough one. Definitely tough one. Um

1697
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:28,360
okay, we kind of we didn't say a lot about guard obviously guardians is a

1698
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:34,040
Extremely well themed room there. You got a lot going on on the shelves. Oh, yeah

1699
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,960
Uh the walkman that is eventually stolen by rocket

1700
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:42,280
Um great stuff on the desk you you pointed out this excess tech

1701
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:48,600
Detail that I forgot about it's a real good chair. It's not big like a throne, but it's ornate like a throne

1702
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,600
Yeah, he's got a quill

1703
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,720
um

1704
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,640
He's got a big chalice

1705
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:58,920
Like it's sort of a I don't know you get a sense of the character. Yeah, there's a

1706
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,700
Grandeur just just enough

1707
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:03,960
Sci-fi and comic book to it

1708
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:09,000
There's two different kind of slightly different versions that you can get to in the actual queue itself

1709
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:12,040
With slightly different are they different from each other really?

1710
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:17,480
Oh one of them is agent colson's big gun from the avengers in it and the other does not

1711
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:23,800
Um, so I like the variation there and i'll say this about being in this physical space

1712
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,560
I

1713
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:30,520
My enjoyment of being in this little room is as high as it ever

1714
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,880
Going on at the 50th time is just as fun being in this little room than the first time

1715
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,000
Yeah, I have to agree this fucking room

1716
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,800
You know what it has and I feel like you brought a lot

1717
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,600
Brought it up a lot in the past

1718
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:52,360
Intimacy, that's thank you. It's warm. It's it's cozy, but it holds a lot of people but it's still very intimate

1719
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:59,240
It's very intimate and I mean like we're not even counting the fact that rocket the animatronic stuff happens in here. I guess technically

1720
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,640
Does that count?

1721
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:06,520
Well, that's just bad opsec, you know if he can get in that easy and snatch stuff

1722
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,080
So might be a strike against it

1723
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:16,200
I think you can't count it because the the collector doesn't want him in there. I know he's not supposed to be there

1724
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:23,560
Yeah, but but it is something that happens. Obviously. It's the main thing that happens in the room, right mark in its favor

1725
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:27,640
Maybe the only one but one that's referred to a lot

1726
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:33,800
As the collector's office, is that right you mean they specifically say

1727
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:36,680
That they call it an office. Yeah

1728
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,440
um

1729
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,560
yes

1730
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,560
Now, but let me let me throw out the like

1731
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:47,320
Like does anybody really want to work in here? This is a pretty oppressive space. I mean, it's cool

1732
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:55,160
But like just in the office or in the whole building. No office the rest isn't an office. The rest is uh, uh, what is it?

1733
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,920
There's a museum or something. Yeah, it's a fortress fortress

1734
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:04,920
well mike and I have both made offices surrounded with knickknacks and creatures and

1735
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,520
Books and comics, you know dim in there, but I do think you can get the light

1736
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,640
I bet it's more adjustable than that indiana jones, which is like probably single light bulb or something hanging

1737
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:21,000
You'd have to like bring stuff in I bet there's like a dimmer switch in the collector's office when it's just him

1738
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,280
He's probably

1739
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:26,760
Like yeah, he brightens it up a little bit. He's trying he's trying to scare and intimidate all the guests

1740
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
so it is a it is

1741
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:34,440
Like it is a little too dark for me and it would be nice to have open air and windows

1742
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,120
but

1743
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,120
my my collector brain

1744
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:42,600
Likes the way everything's laid out and the little things that are in there

1745
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:46,200
So I find it I would find it cool to work in there

1746
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:54,040
Yeah, he boy he needs uh the brutalist himself laszlo toth to come in and get some more light in that place, huh?

1747
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:57,640
uh mark against men in black

1748
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:01,900
Personally, I hate open office spaces

1749
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,920
Oh really? Yeah. Yeah, I think they're oppressed. I think

1750
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,160
It was meant to be like hip and cool and we're all just hanging out

1751
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,880
But also there's nefarious like and we can all keep an eye on you

1752
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:22,280
That's yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. Um, but I think it's a different because that's not that's not like cool

1753
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,440
moderate, you know, it's like it's

1754
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:28,600
You know, it's more like a like a police officer government office in that way

1755
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:33,640
It's just like, you know, there's only there's there's yes, there's lots of space, but you know hundreds of people

1756
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,120
it's like a detective's bullpen like

1757
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:46,360
Yeah, or a newsman like the daily bugle or i've been playing through la noir on the switch and you start every mission and the detectives like

1758
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:51,720
You know assignment room and it's big bone pain kind of thing. Um

1759
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:55,720
It's also not oppressive like an open office

1760
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,200
Concept because the furniture is great. Yes

1761
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,520
Uh, uh, you know you like

1762
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:08,200
Somebody said sterile. I wouldn't say that because this of any these are probably the desks that I would want

1763
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:12,600
There's this I wouldn't say sterile. I'd say minimalist. I'd say mod

1764
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,620
Um, just the the brightest white the sleekest white. Um, the chairs are fantastic

1765
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,960
Um awesome like 60s plus that this like round googie kind of style

1766
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,360
um, I really like the

1767
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:29,560
the big pillars I really like uh, like the

1768
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:34,520
Like kind of the the big unmovable like this like the steel fixtures with the you know with the circles

1769
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:41,480
Uh, uh very bright into them. Yes, bright white and I feel like they keep up with cleaning that white

1770
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:46,600
Those those crazy chairs that are like bulbous

1771
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,660
kind of like

1772
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,120
ballsacky

1773
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:52,840
After the idea in lack of a better term

1774
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:59,320
Uh, um like there's there's kind of like a little like lounge area that's under one of the catwalks and the catwalks are cool

1775
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,520
I love the perspective that you have on it. I love looking down

1776
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:09,560
Um, you know, obviously there's uh, there's this fact that you can ask people to go take a tour potentially

1777
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,760
I don't know if that's still the case

1778
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:14,760
But at least at some point in time you could ask a universal team member

1779
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,400
Can I go look around there and walk up to the desks and it's cool from that vantage point as well

1780
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:24,520
Uh any view of this you have the big console is great. The two aliens are great

1781
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:29,960
Uh, the screen is great the big big cool egg that they watch all the arrivals on

1782
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:35,240
Um, it feels very lived in I I don't I don't think sterile at all

1783
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,840
I don't eat I don't like because I I like I sense

1784
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:44,600
Uh, I sense some hustle and bustle. I sense activity, you know, it's fun to work at the men in black

1785
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:50,680
It seems like it would be fun to work at the men in black and I look you won't I hear what you're saying

1786
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,240
There's a lot of truth to it

1787
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:58,680
But let me put this out there as a collector as a collector of things

1788
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,680
And you know, we're talking about the collector's office. He's a collector of things

1789
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,560
Let me read some of the other things he has in the office

1790
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,840
because ultimately what I find in my real life

1791
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,400
Is when i'm working I like to be

1792
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:17,400
working next to a big wall of shit that i've collected and the shit has to be stuff I like because

1793
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:21,720
Of what you're trying to think of something you're trying to finish something you look over at your shit and you go

1794
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,920
Ah

1795
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,920
You should make that noise in your head

1796
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,720
So I think that the collector in the office has cool shit that would make you go ha

1797
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,920
So it would appeal to me now, obviously it's his taste if I was in there

1798
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:36,440
Maybe I would add some things to it if I was working but he's got

1799
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:43,640
The head of tom morrow a robotic the robotic character from rocket to the moon and interventions. Wow. He's got

1800
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:49,800
A mickey and mini vintage toy, which i've never seen in person really that's listed on there

1801
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:54,440
Uh, he's got a book with the hollywood tower hotel bookmark inside

1802
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,320
He's got the super soldier serum. Wow

1803
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:02,440
Um, he's got there's a couple there's a bunch of these things. He's got some book. That's a reference to joe roadie

1804
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,320
Uh, he's got a vintage map of disneyland. He's got a head from the doll a doll from small world

1805
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,960
These are these are things I want

1806
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,800
I want a little vile and I want a doll from small world's head

1807
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:17,240
Yes, but sometimes all that shit

1808
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:23,480
Gets a little oppressive. Well, that's another conversation to be having that I don't want to have right now

1809
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:30,520
Yeah, so what you what you own ends up owning you they say this is why he doesn't allow his mom to see his shelves

1810
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:30,920
That's right

1811
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:38,120
Because she'll say this is too much and he's still both delighted and nervous when his daughter is like doing laps in there

1812
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:42,200
Don't touch that and don't touch that. I've had a super glue many a toy at this point

1813
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,960
Because of breaks from my daughter it like the theme park rides you've had to lock it all down

1814
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,480
We go in and play we were playing this morning. She was playing with leather head the wrestling leather head from mega toys

1815
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:56,440
She loves leather head. All right. All right, so there are some toys to play with

1816
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:01,720
Okay, let me say she's to play with i'm not insane. She plays with everything. It's only some toys are super glued

1817
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,040
But resentment can build

1818
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,960
I resent her. I

1819
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,960
Resent my two-year-old. Um

1820
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:14,280
We're foolish all of this all the arguments you're making are great, but this cue is great

1821
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:20,360
It's like when we had this idea when the list was quickly made when jason was up the list the shot of joy

1822
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:25,960
I got thinking about this bullpen. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it's wonderful. It's men in black. It's men in black

1823
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,920
It's great, but i'm going collector. I went back and forth a lot

1824
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,960
I wasn't sure I was one than the other than the one I gotta go with scott on this one. Yeah

1825
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,880
Wow, yay

1826
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,840
Do you know what jason i'm mad

1827
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,120
Jason now i'm mad that I didn't vote for franklin's. Okay

1828
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:45,160
Well cheer yourself up

1829
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:48,200
By going to nod your head black suit

1830
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:55,080
Jason thinks that's the superior song of the two. It's pretty fun. No, I didn't say it's

1831
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:01,800
I like it. I don't I don't say it's I might I might put it like because one is just kind of like an

1832
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:06,520
Overplayed hit of the time. Yeah, the other was so audacious in its like

1833
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:13,480
Mythology and this chick serlina, right and the way that it didn't really take no matter how much they aired it on mtv

1834
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,840
I think I would choose to listen to black suits common though

1835
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,600
It's not the better

1836
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:22,120
But if I if you made me if you put a gun to my head and said

1837
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:26,920
Which man in black song do you want to listen to i'd say what that's the gun to the head challenge

1838
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:34,200
The video has those things they're flying on and they're soaring the video's not better than the first video

1839
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,440
Well, I didn't say it was better

1840
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,720
Yeah, he does dance with the alien weren't you like working out

1841
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,080
Yeah, it was I was doing an early part of it

1842
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,320
Nod your heads fell in love with a girl. Is this it?

1843
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:58,760
Uh nelly for tato. Yeah, I think you were listening to philly nelly for tato

1844
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:02,680
You're listening to nod your head and fell in love with a girl is really good

1845
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,280
Is it a treadmill or an elliptical?

1846
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:12,360
Uh, like one of those ones that had a resistance band and it swung the pedals back. So I think

1847
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:15,240
Yeah, yeah

1848
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,560
Swing swing

1849
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:21,880
I'm like a bird one elliptical away from like

1850
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:23,080
7 a.m

1851
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:28,920
To 10 before programming started vh1 would just loop music videos and you didn't know what you're gonna get

1852
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:34,360
A great blend whether you're a teen or a 50 something. Yeah. All right

1853
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:39,080
Well now we land back at the grab bag, which has become another cartoon

1854
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,720
area perhaps not surprisingly

1855
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,440
um bluedo's office and

1856
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:46,600
conservative pulsed

1857
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:51,720
All right. Sorry. I was pretty careful. Yeah, I think I was just like I was practicing in the mirror for so long

1858
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:56,360
Earlier morning that I was just ready for it. So let me oh, what is it? All right, the daily bugle

1859
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:01,320
Right amazing adventures. You knew what you're doing. You were being a scam like my girl

1860
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:05,640
We know what jason says but it is seemingly she should be conflicted

1861
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:08,440
I think because it's popeye and it's spider-man this well

1862
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:12,380
We have it's two it's islands of adventure against islands of adventure

1863
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,760
A true sophie's choice for jason. This is a tough one

1864
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:21,180
Like implying any faults in anything in islands of adventure

1865
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,360
It's a very difficult thing. Yeah for him to do

1866
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,840
Uh, but you do have to pick a favorite

1867
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:30,600
I that makes me interested to start with jason's thoughts here. I'd love to start with jason

1868
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:34,280
Yeah, because you'll be the most conflicted here. I think well, yeah, but

1869
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,560
Except one is spider-man. Yeah, that's what

1870
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,600
I like popeye and bluedo

1871
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:43,240
but

1872
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:46,120
I love spider-man if popeye marry

1873
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,360
spider-man

1874
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:51,080
Uh kill conservative pollster franklin's

1875
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,880
Sorry, it's not what I do

1876
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:02,040
Well, maybe so maybe there's no conflict then I guess not I guess it's spider-man for jason

1877
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:06,840
Yeah, I think it's got to be spider-man for me. I mean, it's so detailed

1878
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:14,600
And so officey. Yeah bluedo is like a nice quick hit but it's a gag more than an office

1879
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:19,160
I'm a little surprised that it made it as far as it did it being like the tiniest caged office

1880
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,560
But I think it really is just a virtue of

1881
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:27,640
That yeah, he's got a trophy treasure. Yeah, it's got the cannon and he's got treasure. It's pretty good

1882
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:32,680
It's pretty good. But yeah, I gotta say spider-man. That's come on. It's spider-man. It's dealing with like

1883
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,600
This is where like obviously this is correct

1884
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:38,440
I just wish it hadn't been because let me ask you this mike bluedo versus

1885
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,920
Uh franklin's

1886
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,120
Hmm looks interesting

1887
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,120
I

1888
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:52,120
Don't have time. Yeah, I know we can't go back to ones that were time. This is about uh, uh, yes making choices

1889
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:59,480
Uh, not doing rematches that can't exist. We have to keep plowing we have moved from the ergonomic eight to

1890
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:01,080
the

1891
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,080
What I call it the feng shui four

1892
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:07,960
A little cleaner than the fax machine four

1893
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:09,960
Oh

1894
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:16,280
But this is the wait, this is the final four we have made it to all right, so

1895
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:24,520
That means that what we can see at least per these matchups the best four fake offices in theme parkton

1896
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,960
the observatory from adventure land tree house bowser's study men in black

1897
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:35,240
Headquarters and the daily bugle. That's a really good list. I think that's an excellent list

1898
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:41,880
Um, and I and I now I like that we've got some like diversity in style because the very

1899
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,200
uh realistic

1900
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,200
Uh, and you know tropical

1901
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:50,200
Adventureland treehouse goes against bowser's study. These are two extremely different vibes

1902
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,120
um

1903
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:58,120
Now mario kart in the final four of any. Yeah, who would have thought is a real shocker?

1904
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:59,720
um

1905
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:00,680
I

1906
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,560
uh

1907
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:07,000
Hmm, I got I have no immediate thoughts here. I'm working through it

1908
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:14,200
Um, but we need to do it while we record that's I can't just you can't turn you cannot tell me to turn the mics off

1909
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:19,160
No, we can't that's not how we worked. Does anyone have a strong knee jerk

1910
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,920
Either way or an angle on one of these that was not already had

1911
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:25,960
It's a good question. Um

1912
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:29,160
I think that

1913
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:37,480
Hmm, we just do in the first two. Yes. Okay treehouse bowser

1914
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:42,040
The young girl's hopes and dreams

1915
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,680
versus the ultimate villains

1916
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:49,480
Den of villainy. Yeah place where he creates weapons of war

1917
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,600
And cute if harmful

1918
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:58,440
The thing bowser does everything it is cute. That's the that's the problem and I guess look that is also

1919
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,240
you know part of

1920
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:06,120
You know in real life too if somebody is is nice, but evil

1921
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,440
If they they say things if they have decorum, this is a big argument

1922
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:14,440
you have sometimes with somebody like a frank luntz who ultimately they

1923
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:20,700
You know, they agree with the same evil principles and and viewpoints

1924
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,640
But they want the politicians to do it nicely

1925
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:30,280
They want to say it with a smile and don't you think bowser in a lot of ways by making his weapons smile?

1926
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:35,880
And making them cute he's doing a lot of the same things that a frank luntz

1927
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:43,800
Would do they want a similar they have a similar approach bowser really is modern american politics, isn't he?

1928
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,640
That's what i'm saying do it with a smile, right? Wow. So maybe

1929
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,880
maybe

1930
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:51,880
We should not be swayed

1931
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:57,480
By the cuteness of bowser's office and we should not overlook

1932
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
the destruction

1933
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,080
That he will no doubt. Yeah

1934
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:08,600
Reek and that a vote for bowser is a vote for kind of this gross faux masculinity

1935
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:13,480
Like if you went to a restaurant that served steak and that's the ultimate height of it. Yes

1936
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,400
Don't you dare if arthur and sons had an office we don't we so we have gotten a glimpse of arthur and sons the soon to be

1937
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:25,880
Open downtown disney steak and bourbon restaurant. I didn't see a glimpse

1938
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:29,800
I didn't see an office like a themed office there

1939
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:34,200
To add to this because I would I would probably pick an 11th hour

1940
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:40,360
Or I would make an 11th hour choice to replace the daily bugle with the arthur and sons office

1941
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:46,680
But it hasn't happened so our yet. Look we already we already had franklin's game. That's too many things bad enough

1942
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:49,880
We're talking about bowser's office where he goes to stew

1943
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:54,760
After he betrays his friend of decades the innocent kyle glass

1944
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:57,080
You know

1945
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:01,800
Well, it's kyle gass first of all, but you're saying because he thought was yeah

1946
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:04,280
That was a lot of levels to get to a joke with

1947
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:09,160
With a very wrong name jack black is bowser in the movies

1948
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:14,680
Yes, and he sings a silly song broke up within that brief time where he said a thing about um

1949
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,360
so

1950
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:22,120
I just want to make sure everybody understands what we are voting for or against here

1951
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:25,080
because it is

1952
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:30,600
A lot more insidious than it seems sure. Um, I pulled up a video of the queue

1953
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:37,080
And I immediately landed on a close-up of a big book that says dental hygiene for chain chomps

1954
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:45,640
I am choosing bowser's gun on that alone. I love every one. These books are so good. We were so

1955
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,080
Like we've been so mean to this land

1956
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:54,440
But every everything in here if it was all like this like rich details

1957
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,080
For a kid who grew up playing mario

1958
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,240
And even that I think would be fun if even if you just vaguely understood the character

1959
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,880
Yeah, you know and the mythology

1960
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,200
um

1961
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:12,840
Yeah, and it's also grooming the motorways you get friendly landscaping. That's so good. You gotta give it to this ride also for

1962
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:16,920
Showing you something about bowser that you cannot see

1963
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:22,520
Elsewhere it's creating new. Yeah, you really get into his head. Don't you?

1964
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:27,240
Oh, and then there's a little animation. I'm voting for evil as well. All right a vote for evil

1965
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,560
Jason, do you want to do that that gives it to bowser?

1966
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,240
But do you uh want to cast the vote essentially?

1967
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:36,840
Do you want to do oh, yeah, I was gonna say adventure land just because I think it's cute and it's got lots of natural light

1968
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:41,800
That's nice. It is very nice. I can't disagree with that, but I can't disagree with your guys

1969
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:47,080
You know affection for this place. I can't believe final two. Our embrace of evil. Geez. Yeah. Yeah

1970
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,560
um

1971
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:53,800
Let's see. So that takes us then to this is a heavy hitter for sure

1972
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:57,640
I kind of yeah seem like a place that it all might go men in black

1973
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,800
versus daily bugle

1974
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:02,600
They oof. These are my yeah, these are my guys

1975
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:09,080
I mean jason knows

1976
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:15,640
Let's be honest. I mean, it's still daily bugle for me. Okay. All right, so it's just so it becomes that we talk about it

1977
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,800
um, I

1978
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:19,880
Mike i'm going to show you a photo. Yeah, go ahead

1979
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:22,120
the

1980
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:24,120
Not to just cut to the photo. Um

1981
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:27,240
Something that is clever about the daily bugle

1982
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:34,840
Styling is that it is painted like a comic book where you know

1983
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:41,720
Foreground details are more fleshed out and then background details just kind of fall into more simple color

1984
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,040
And I think that's cool and clever

1985
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:45,480
however

1986
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:47,480
Uh, you end up with things like this

1987
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:50,120
a bunch of gray

1988
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,600
Donuts and fruits and weird

1989
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:58,120
Uh croissants that they haven't repainted gray croissants that are

1990
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:03,640
Chipping away their paint. Yeah through the years. Yeah, this image. This is not a good image

1991
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:06,120
I'm not saying that i'm not going to vote for it

1992
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:11,240
But come on this this like what is this gray hamburger? What is this?

1993
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:16,360
Well, doesn't that reflect the decaying of the newspaper economy in america

1994
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:23,560
Surely, that's what they were thinking. I like your rationalization, but it did there were a bunch of weird gray donuts

1995
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:27,800
At this place in 99 too. Yeah. Yeah, there was some gray

1996
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:34,200
Huh, okay. Hmm. Do you know what you're voting for?

1997
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:41,080
You don't have to i'm just wondering if you do not not totally locked in

1998
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:43,960
Okay

1999
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,200
Here's what i'll say

2000
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,920
About spider-man

2001
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:52,920
It's great. I'm a huge spider-man a huge marvel fan. Okay

2002
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:59,160
They are trying to recreate comic book art in real life

2003
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:02,120
now more pop party than the kind of

2004
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,200
Grays and browns of the mcu. Well, yes

2005
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:09,240
Yes more like a comic book versus actually what it looks like with the

2006
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:15,720
What the slop the background cgi slop looks like oftentimes on the movies in the movies

2007
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:17,720
um

2008
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:22,280
I think that I have been shown through toys and through other different

2009
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:24,840
themed environments

2010
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:28,520
That the way in which they've made sort of a cell shaded

2011
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:30,920
environment

2012
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:34,760
It the spider-man to me looks a little outdated at this point

2013
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:36,920
And I looked

2014
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,480
And I remembered that there's a south korean cafe

2015
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:44,840
That has tried to recreate its space to make it look like like a comic or a comic strip

2016
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:47,240
And like it is so cool looking

2017
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:49,320
like wow

2018
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,880
They have come a long way and this has come this well what you're showing us is essentially just black and white

2019
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:58,360
They just completely limited about color palette. I think there are but there's a woman

2020
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:03,880
In full color obviously because she's from real life, right sitting in an illustrated black and white world

2021
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:08,520
That is really neat. I would like to go to this really closer to like your black and white

2022
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:16,280
Graphic novels or art comics, right? And I think they're i've seen a sort of more colorful versions of this and I could I could look

2023
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,120
um

2024
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:20,120
but

2025
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:22,680
I

2026
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,780
Do think there's a little tiredness to the spider-man

2027
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:29,960
Q after all this time can you barely look at jason you barely look at it

2028
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:35,320
You were scanning the room of where to put your eyes and even though like I voted kind of against men in black

2029
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:38,200
The other two times I do think it's probably

2030
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,760
held up

2031
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:46,680
In a stronger way in some ways. This perfectly looks like the movie and

2032
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:55,800
I think they could plus that spider-man q up by giving it some new paint paint would help making it look a little fresher

2033
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:58,280
And they don't have to necessarily go this hard with cell shading

2034
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,720
But i've seen so much good cell shading just on my toys

2035
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:07,640
My toys are amazing that style of turtle that you have. I don't know if that's what you're talking about

2036
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:09,640
But the style that's more cartoonish

2037
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:16,300
Um, yeah, that's that's meant to look like it does it great. Mondo does great spider-man and x-men

2038
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:22,680
One six scale cell shaded animated series style to this point now where the technology is whatever

2039
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:25,080
Technology the artistry has gotten so good

2040
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:27,960
That it does make me

2041
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:32,200
As impressive as it used to be and I think i'm voting men in black. Wow

2042
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:37,400
Wow, even after you just sent me the artist adam cubert showing

2043
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:43,800
How he had max his son's name in the ice man. Well, but that's not the i'm not that's outside

2044
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:47,400
That's outside. That's fine. I'm not gonna disrespect adam

2045
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,040
One of my but it weren't my heart

2046
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:56,040
Who hid my heart i'm not saying wicked needs to take over marvel's superhero island. I didn't say that

2047
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,960
I do think it's possible, but I don't i'm not saying I want it

2048
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:05,080
It's been a rumor for many years. Look. Yeah, it's all different things. Do I love

2049
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:11,000
The song hero by chad skroger featuring josey scott. Of course, of course I do

2050
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:16,680
If we're talking 2001 era music, that's the top of the top. That's the best anyone ever did it

2051
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:22,300
But that's not this hold on hold on no, well is hero or vindicated

2052
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,840
Which is your choice? No hero is oh always

2053
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:32,600
I don't you don't really know what vindicated is is that dashboard confessional for spider-man indicated. I am selfish

2054
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:37,160
I am wrong. I think i'm right. I don't know. I'm right

2055
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:43,480
I swear I knew it all along and I am i'm doing like the long but it's not really

2056
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:47,080
What a good little concert I just got yeah, yeah

2057
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:52,280
You got some emotion out there. I do. Yeah, I don't know the spider man

2058
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:56,280
Three song and I don't know the men in black three or four songs

2059
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:01,800
Uh chris, that's the guy's name. I've seen dashboard confessional twice, but i'm not a fan of them

2060
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,360
You're not a fan of them. All right. Yeah

2061
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:11,160
Uh, I okay. I have not locked in my vote. I want to give a shout out to the fact that the daily bugle

2062
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:16,120
Uh has adapted with the times. Yes, they make newspapers, but they also have their own

2063
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:18,200
internal use

2064
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:20,200
Internet called bugle net

2065
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:25,740
That helps them track villains and where they are great and that mythology I think is spectacular

2066
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:32,120
Uh, and i'm glad they have it and I like that. It's kind of 99 era clunky desktops, but the devil's in the details

2067
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:36,600
Uh, I don't like these gray croissants and i'm locking in men in black

2068
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:38,600
Oh my gosh

2069
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:41,160
Wow final two

2070
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:46,760
Wow, so that brings us jason just took a swig of whiskey a bourbon

2071
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:50,920
Yeah, it's oh, no things have gotten so bad. He's uh

2072
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:56,680
I prefer he's resorting to the devil bourbon. I prefer my sugar and chocolate. No my beverage

2073
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:02,520
Okay, so that gets us down to

2074
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:04,520
the

2075
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:08,620
Uh, the tidy two. Whoa, we're down to the tidy two a head-to-head

2076
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:17,400
Universal studios takes it entirely. This is too wild. Yeah is out. Disney has been out. I'm so sorry

2077
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,320
What was mike's vote?

2078
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:21,400
No, it's black men in black. Oh, okay. Oh, yes

2079
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:24,520
He blacked him out. He wasn't even reacting to the

2080
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:30,440
The loss of spider-man he wasn't paying attention. You didn't definitively say yes. He did. No, he didn't

2081
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:35,960
Um, no, that's that it's men in black. Uh, so that brings us wow, it's all universal

2082
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:42,040
That's really something they do good offices. They do good offices. Um, so browser study versus men in black

2083
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:49,320
Uh, is it hard or is it easy? Is it hard or is it easy? Um, yeah, I don't know. I don't know

2084
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,480
Uh, is it?

2085
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:55,560
We've got one that is full of detail. They're both like really great

2086
02:10:56,520 --> 02:11:01,100
Worlds like the the world of nintendo versus the incredible

2087
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,400
production design

2088
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:05,800
Of men in black now, this is it's obviously not

2089
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,320
You know

2090
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:12,920
If you watch a scene from the movie of the real setting that this is portraying and then you look at the actual space

2091
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,360
in a youtube video

2092
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:18,200
it is much smaller, but they do a really good job of just of like

2093
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:23,160
Maximizing space and making it feel giant and the way they send you in via catwalk

2094
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:29,320
It feels huge even though it's probably you know, like a fifth of the size of the set maybe less

2095
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:31,160
um

2096
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:34,360
I also in thinking about men in black was reflecting on the

2097
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:37,080
Awesome. I mean in general

2098
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:43,960
The production design of the men in black films and all of the all of barry sonnenfeld's films those including adam's family

2099
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:50,520
Um and remembering that it's all that all of that is one guy bo welch who is also tim burton's guy same guy

2100
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Same production designer like for if you took just one of them legend

2101
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:58,200
Uh, but both burton and sonnenfeld some of the best

2102
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:01,400
Uh production design movies ever and I forgot this guy

2103
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:04,200
Mr. Catherine o'hara

2104
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:09,400
They met during beetle juice. Yeah. Yeah. Wow what that's one of the greatest couples

2105
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:14,120
Ever to exist true icons in their field

2106
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,520
Uh both incredible

2107
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:19,080
um, so I like that there is

2108
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:22,520
I don't know. It's just it's great movie aesthetics that's portrayed

2109
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:27,160
You know mike you said yeah at some point you said like maybe an argument of something else

2110
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:31,080
Yeah, it looks like the movie and that is you know, I guess invention

2111
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:36,520
Is good bowser's office a space that we have not seen before versus recreating a movie

2112
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:39,960
But it's not like it was just recreating the movie. They had to do it with a pretty minimal space

2113
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:42,120
Yeah, and make it feel bigger than it is

2114
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:43,560
um

2115
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:47,960
And I don't I mean i'm i'm very impressed by both. I like these I like the tidy too

2116
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:57,180
Jason, are you are you okay? First of all? Yeah. Yeah, no, i'll survive. Okay. I will say a very strong memory in the year 2000

2117
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:01,480
of uh going down to florida with my family

2118
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:07,960
And my brother kind of was mostly doing smaller rides with my mom and my dad and I

2119
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:13,960
Went to islands of adventure after I had a day of rest because I woke up and I'm puke because I was so stressed out

2120
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:15,480
uh

2121
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:18,520
But you were you were that way then too

2122
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:22,040
As a freshman in high school, yeah

2123
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:29,000
I uh, but back then it could be stressed and just walk into alfredo's get a big plate of

2124
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:32,760
Fettuccine alfredo calm down can't do that anymore

2125
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:39,560
But the one day me and him went to universal and it's like we're getting one park ticket. Which one?

2126
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:43,240
And men in black had just opened I think

2127
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:46,200
And I was like, I really want to do that ride

2128
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,160
But I want to go to islands of adventure for so I made my choice

2129
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:57,480
I went that was all to say you didn't go. No, I didn't I eventually did and I wrote it again and again and again

2130
02:13:57,640 --> 02:14:01,560
On men in black. Mm-hmm. So I have a lot of affection for this

2131
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:04,860
In the mid 90s after having an nes

2132
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:07,560
I switched to genesis

2133
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:13,960
You know, what is this what for what what what you're saying you change opinions I switched to sega genesis for you're saying

2134
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:17,560
You could switch away from islands of adventure. That's what you're saying. What's that?

2135
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:24,760
What's the point you're trying to make about the genesis? Uh, I have more affection for the men in black ride than mario

2136
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:26,040
paraphernalia

2137
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:29,560
Oh, I see got it. I didn't really get back on board

2138
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:35,240
I mean I fiddle with my brother's game uh game queued every now and then fiddle. We did have we did

2139
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:40,200
I did too I do a fiddle sesh, but I was mostly playing like goldeneye. Uh

2140
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:43,640
Poof, uh, so

2141
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:50,600
I think my vote is men in black because I like it all so much the building we've been talked about the building

2142
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:52,920
That we haven't talked about if buildings count

2143
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:58,600
Yeah, we didn't even go over that they it's kind of weird because it's not it doesn't look like an office from the outside

2144
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:01,240
Yeah, it's kind of a I don't know if it factors in

2145
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:02,920
um

2146
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:06,120
Hmm mike, are you do you feel conflicted here?

2147
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:12,840
I do feel conflicted because I really i've grown more affectionate for the office as we uh bowser's office as we talk about it

2148
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,720
and it does really

2149
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:21,320
Satisfy a lot of things a lot of needs you would have from a space like this

2150
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:25,240
Especially attached to a character like this. There's so much character in it

2151
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:29,320
Yeah, so that's why that's where the conflict comes into where i'm like, yeah

2152
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:32,040
I guess of all the different characters on the list

2153
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:37,000
His office does feel the most fun now, maybe I could argue the collector but he's out of the running

2154
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,840
But he really is with all apologies to indiana jones. It's like yeah, it's indiana jones office. There's maps in there, right versus

2155
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:45,640
Uh bowser with the hundred

2156
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:52,040
Jokes and details. Yeah, not that indiana jones doesn't call for that, but you know what sure I do fleshed out

2157
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:58,120
Yes, it's so fleshed out and it's so yes fun and design. So that is where my conflict comes in

2158
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:02,360
Is that I just think it's like the best possible version of something like that

2159
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:07,640
Um, and it's cartoony it represents the it did come down to cartoon versus realistic

2160
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:12,840
Yes, and it is cartoony too, which I like which is you really want it to transport you somewhere

2161
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,760
You know, which obviously whatever men in black, but it's more real world, of course

2162
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:20,040
Um, so that's what that's what i'm weighing in my head right now

2163
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:22,760
Uh with the two of them

2164
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:28,680
Yes, um, okay by what I want to say details are my favorite part about maria cart

2165
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:30,280
However

2166
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:35,560
men in black detail game strong something that you want out of any of these offices are just like I keep wanting to say

2167
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:38,520
Freeze frame gags, but that's not it because you don't you're not freezing a frame

2168
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:43,960
It's you're walking through a space but kind of like blink and you'll miss it kind of details. There's a great

2169
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:48,920
Signs implying other offices and other areas of the of the headquarters

2170
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:54,360
I think are like then these are so good in men in black like there's a there's a directory that points you to

2171
02:16:55,320 --> 02:17:01,800
Fingerprint removal urban legend archive oxygen free zone human resources alien resources

2172
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:09,000
Child and spore daycare excellent sign. Those are good. This is a great. So so everything that's that's the caliber of

2173
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:12,600
Detail that is in bowser. I also want to point this one out

2174
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:13,320
I said that you know

2175
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:17,400
You can ask a team member to go give you a tour and like you have to walk on the floor and look at the

2176
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:18,440
desks

2177
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:21,240
And the desks here's something you can't tell from up there

2178
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:28,200
On each of the desks in the men in black bullpen is the paperwork like immigration papers

2179
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,920
of other alien characters

2180
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:32,440
in

2181
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:36,920
Universal studios in that park specifically for example bumblebee

2182
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:44,040
Broken at like formal forms. Yeah with last name and then first name so seeing b bumble

2183
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:46,760
And then the best one the best one

2184
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:48,600
for sure

2185
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:53,100
Is uh, there's immigration paperwork for king from the simpsons

2186
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:57,100
And in the section that says other names or aliases

2187
02:17:57,720 --> 02:17:59,720
bob dole

2188
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:04,440
Perfect, that's a good that is a good this is an office that is like

2189
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,760
Down to like the tiniest detail you can't even see that you can only see if you ask somebody to go see it

2190
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:15,400
A great reference to a great episode. Yeah, there's nothing to do with men in black

2191
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:16,680
We're not even in the men of black

2192
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:22,200
But the fact that it's taking going down on the floor and then it ties together all of universal studios aliens

2193
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:27,480
Really wish et was in there et sure, but that's what that's literally what et is is immigration

2194
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:28,840
Well, you're an oveille

2195
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:33,800
Well now I want to get down there and see if there's a kodos one that says alias bill clint

2196
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:36,840
I'm, not sure. I don't know. I only saw two desks in this video

2197
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:41,000
You're making my frank lund's argument from earlier about the different unit the shared universe

2198
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:43,160
As far as like

2199
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:47,720
Tying in different mythologies bringing hogan's heroes in with with bill clinton with the presidency

2200
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:52,760
Yes, george wood now. Here's a question to either of these does frank lund's knock out either of these

2201
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:55,800
If it made it to the final two

2202
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:01,160
There's another universe where it won all except jason would have always protected spider-man for sure

2203
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:05,560
Yeah, yeah spider-man all the way to the end, right? I think so. Mm-hmm. He's loyal

2204
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
My final four would have probably been

2205
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:13,160
frank lund's dot gandhar the collector

2206
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:16,360
and um

2207
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,480
uh

2208
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:21,720
Walt's apartment walt's apartment not fake. That's the problem fake

2209
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:26,120
Although I guess you could say frank's is kind of not fake if he does his real office. Yeah, that's true

2210
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,200
I guess that's points against it. Yeah, so

2211
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:30,600
Yeah

2212
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:33,880
Would do you would either of the bowser men in black would not have ended up in your final four?

2213
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:37,240
Um

2214
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:41,880
No, wow, I don't think wow so that puts you in a strange place. So you kind of have no allegiances

2215
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:45,480
I'd say I don't know because I also think it's a little bit like

2216
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:49,400
Man in black is so big. They have such a luxury of scope

2217
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:53,240
And that's just something that most of these places do not have the luxury of

2218
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:57,080
Like if you were to expand out bowser with that real estate

2219
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:02,680
It's no contest. Sure. So that's what that's where i'm trying to weigh the size of a mat. Yeah

2220
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:07,000
Size there's nothing that big in in the whole bracket

2221
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:09,400
Yeah, so

2222
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:11,960
It's unfair because if you put the same love

2223
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:16,200
Times whatever the size is times five of bowser in

2224
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:18,200
I think it's bowser all day

2225
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,960
Sure, the fact but the fact that it's limited to this room and the rest is not offices

2226
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:25,000
But it's a fun surprise that there's an office in this castle, isn't there?

2227
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:31,240
It's a great surprise learning that he reads learning that bowser is a reader and that he plays big and dumb

2228
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:36,120
But maybe it's all calculated right, but let's extend out. That's okay. Let's imagine the entire queue

2229
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:44,120
Of bowser's castle is an office. Yeah, just a hypothetical to try to get us on the exact equal footing, you know, yes

2230
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:49,160
I think you're in the you're neck and neck. Yeah as far as cool details

2231
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:53,560
You're kind of doing a handicap here and yes putting them putting making the size of the same exactly

2232
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:56,440
Because there's so much other cool shit in that queue

2233
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:59,560
so I cannot just

2234
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:04,040
Deliver a victory for something because it has the gift of of size

2235
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:10,200
To me, it's not size to me. It is certainly great details. I'm not saying that's all it is

2236
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:13,640
Yeah, I think if you had less space, I think I might still go men in black

2237
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:17,320
I think it's a great it feels it feels lived in which is something we need

2238
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:19,880
Uh details are great, which is something we need

2239
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:22,920
Um, you know you sense character in there

2240
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:28,280
Uh, yes all that's true and and just great and maybe I might also be I just like the 60s

2241
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:32,840
I like that aesthetic a lot as well. What if men in black was the size of bowser though?

2242
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:34,840
What's in there?

2243
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:35,800
What goes in there?

2244
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:37,320
Well, you know what stack them up

2245
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:43,240
You have a little glimpse of that because you see that break room that those alien that the sure the worms or whatever are working

2246
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:46,360
In that they've taken over and they're being gross in and that's a room

2247
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:50,120
You don't even get to go in you just that's like one of these little cage offices and that's great

2248
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:56,860
I'm not grading it on that but that shows you what a small version of it is like it would be still detailed still fantastical

2249
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:00,120
Doing it. God damn it men in black alien attack

2250
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:06,680
Locking it in I will decide I will give my dissenting opinion my supreme court justice dissenting opinion that I believe bowser

2251
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:08,760
It is bowser for you. Wow

2252
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:11,240
Wow, I'll pen a multi-paragraph dissent

2253
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:14,760
That I will publish to make it known in the history books

2254
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:15,480
Yes

2255
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:21,640
That I dissented that which will do a lot your note of dissent frank lens will have a copy of it in his oval office as well

2256
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,020
just for posterity just for

2257
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:31,300
Preservation sake from babe ruth letters to mike carlson rants about why bowser should have won a fake office contest

2258
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:36,180
I'll be on the record for that bowser did not win the men in black won men in black

2259
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:40,260
Has taken it also maybe i'm i'm also maybe skewed in like

2260
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:43,940
Though i'm happy mario kart made it all this way something that we have trashed

2261
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:48,580
It is really hard to say that mario kart is the greatest theme park office of all time

2262
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:53,380
It doesn't feel right feels like you need kind of I think that's your you're letting you see

2263
02:22:53,380 --> 02:22:55,780
I think you're revealing that you're letting the feelings of the ride

2264
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:59,940
Into this which should not be part of it. I know but I think I prevented as long

2265
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:02,500
Hey, I got it into the final two couldn't I that's true

2266
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:08,020
By the way, uh my plus up for the men in black area you a very tall man

2267
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:15,940
Doing the vincente anafrio sugar and he's walking around in front of the building and two like men in black

2268
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:20,660
Agents have their like guns in their hoof in their way after it

2269
02:23:21,140 --> 02:23:26,340
How is that not a walk-around character in universal studios sugar vincente anafrio sugar

2270
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:30,340
I feel like so like have such a bad headache by the end of the shift

2271
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:33,380
That would be so

2272
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:36,580
I can't imagine doing it now

2273
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:43,380
But I feel like i've only seen more and more online appreciation for that performance. Oh, it's great

2274
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:48,260
No, that's one of those. Yeah, it looms larger now than it did at the time. Uh, yeah

2275
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:50,420
That's great to see

2276
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:53,140
Um, well, uh, i'm happy with this

2277
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:53,940
Is everybody happy?

2278
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:58,580
I don't know if everybody's happy because it probably would have been spiderman for you and it probably would have been franklin's for you

2279
02:24:00,020 --> 02:24:03,460
I had a feeling it would come down to men in black her daily people. So

2280
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:07,140
5050 i'm satisfied. All right. All right

2281
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:11,540
Um audience, are you satisfied? Let us know. I hope so

2282
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:16,420
I hope it's not like the vehicle one where we knocked out indiana jones early and people were mad

2283
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:21,940
They might be mad here because maybe people like this indiana jones one more than I don't know. I can't tell

2284
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:28,100
These always provoke a lot of divisiveness. I feel but you know, I yeah, I wonder what consensus

2285
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:30,660
I don't know. We were talking about earlier how like, you know, we throw the rule

2286
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:34,340
You don't necessarily follow the rules of this and you can sub things in and out. I'd like to just real quick

2287
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:36,660
Um, can we sub out?

2288
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:39,380
the winner men in black for uh collector's office

2289
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:41,940
Can a collector's office win?

2290
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:47,700
Can we sub can I do that you want to you wanted to jump multiple rounds? I just wanted to win could it win

2291
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:51,380
That you're you're asking us. Yes. You have to say yes or no. No

2292
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:54,500
Okay. Well, I just want to try. I just want to try

2293
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:59,860
Just because I wanted to flaunt the rules a little bit because maybe we didn't flaunt them hard enough. Yeah, I don't know

2294
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:02,020
potentially

2295
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:04,020
Nope, it's too late. It happened

2296
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,580
Yeah

2297
02:25:06,580 --> 02:25:11,700
All right. All right. Whoa an elliptical just materialized out of nowhere. Jason's going nuts

2298
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:15,380
I'm gonna hop off my flying elevator to hop on

2299
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,520
My qvc purchased elliptical

2300
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:22,260
I feel I feel good about it

2301
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:27,940
Uh, I hope you do too and I hope you like it. I as always curious about ideas for what are you playing?

2302
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:33,320
No, no boo vindicated

2303
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:35,320
Vindicated

2304
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:42,600
You are not vindicated you're not vindicated you try to do one last minute slide out

2305
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:46,840
This guy's breaking the rules trying to cheat the system like frank luntz's cronies

2306
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:53,720
What a look this guy's got this lead singer lately of dashboard. Yeah. Yeah, you should do you should do it

2307
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:57,400
You're trying to look young and hip try to look like this dashboard guy, which show me the look

2308
02:25:58,360 --> 02:26:00,360
I mean, he's got a real like

2309
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,560
I don't know if this is photoshopped his beard and he looks you know what he looks like

2310
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:11,500
He looks like a cool because it's such listener. It's such jet black hair and beard. He looks like a cool emaciated bluedo

2311
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:18,600
If bluedo, he's kind of got like an old hat. He's emo bluedo. You know what bluedo would say about this

2312
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:22,440
I'm excited to see

2313
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:25,080
Jason got his phone out

2314
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:31,240
How long will it take to get to the part jason wanted

2315
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:34,120
minute 45

2316
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:36,920
And also he should move the phone closer. Definitely should do that

2317
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:39,800
In front of it probably it would help

2318
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:47,560
He would say so bluedo would just say sweet haven that's what he would say

2319
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:50,440
God must love us

2320
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,320
Why it's that wasn't that wasn't him though from the robert altman, we know what it is

2321
02:26:55,400 --> 02:27:00,120
No, we know what it is. But why would he say that because he would say oh sweet haven he loves the town

2322
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:02,360
No, he doesn't he's mean to everybody in it

2323
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:08,140
Yeah, he's the biggest jerk in sweet. Hey, lots of people have conflicted feelings about their hometown

2324
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:18,200
I guess that's true. I can't deny that. All right. Well, thank you for that. You survived podcast the ride fake office final four

2327
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:31,880
Really quick on the way at the door. I don't want to lock this in as next year, but I do want to throw it out

2328
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:37,880
Mike and I had an idea while we were out and about in the recent past. This idea was

2329
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:42,600
The fire for yeah the fire for here's what this would be

2330
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:48,040
Two sides maybe still maybe still 16 one half fake fire

2331
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:54,280
We're talking end of pirates. We're talking big thunder. We're talking the burning of rome the other side

2332
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:56,440
real fire

2333
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:57,400
mummy

2334
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:03,640
The epcot fire after during illuminations that peter newnes saw as mcfodur. Yes real

2335
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:04,680
Yes

2336
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:12,280
The fire that killed king kong the fire that peter newton from hermans hermits noticed at the american adventure stage when france was on fire

2337
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:15,400
Is that right france? We didn't actually talk about this on the show how to play out what happened?

2338
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:17,160
He well peter new was singing mrs

2339
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:22,760
brown you've got a lovely daughter on the stage at the garden rocks at epcot in front of the american pavilion and

2340
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:27,640
He looked over in the middle of maybe the chorus and he got oh france is on fire and he went back to singing

2341
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:33,480
There's like a cooler fire or something. I think everyone was okay. Luckily patch of grass lit on fire

2342
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:38,680
Oh, I don't know the official reason. Yeah, I mean that it's it'll be a year out and therefore less topical

2343
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:43,480
But we can keep it alive if we can devote a lot of time to the oval office in conservative pollsters

2344
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:46,440
For the bolster frank lunce's house, that's true

2345
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:51,960
We can within one of the candidates in this could be peter newnes fire peter newnes noticed fire

2346
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:58,440
I want to do a whole episode on peter newnes. That's well, that's possible too. That's frank lunce has a fire for

2347
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:01,080
uh good governance

2348
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:03,320
That's true

2349
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:07,160
He sure does and the resolute desk reminds him that this is possible

2350
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:13,960
Uh, but anyway the fire for real fire versus fake fire. Yeah, which division wins. I think it's a strong idea

2351
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:17,560
Do you have a better one leave it in the comments or leave it in your head?

2352
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:23,560
We think of the ideas. All right, that's how this show works. Whoa, bluto got here. No, no

2353
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:26,120
Whoa, sweet haven
