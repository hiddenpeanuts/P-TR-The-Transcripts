Warning!

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,640
The following podcast may contain man on horse action, high octane talk of comic strips from

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,800
the depression, and splash-tacular analysis of Islands of Adventure mainstay Dudley Do-right's

Hey everybody, welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,360
who send each other links when Disneyland introduces a new taco.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
Joining me as always Scott Gardner and Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Hello.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,480
It's been a while, Brent, by the way.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,520
We're just getting back in the swing of things.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
I've been gone for a few weeks.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,080
Oh, I meant since taco news.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
No new taco news.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Oh, good point.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Step it up, Disney.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Yeah.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Thanksgiving is coming.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,800
There will be a turkey and stuffing taco soon enough available for you to purchase.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,680
And we will send links to each other and excitedly talk about it.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,640
We are part of Teral Audio, which is home of Doughboys and other great podcasts.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,120
And today we're talking a pretty weird ride.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,040
Dudley Do-right's Ripsaw Falls, Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Ever since we...

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
I was very skeptical about this.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,880
I was a little bit, I don't know, you know what?

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,000
I like the idea of that title sitting in the list of episodes being one of the first ones

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,240
as if that's one of the major rides we have to get to.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
You know what?

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Maybe it is.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Maybe it is.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,480
Major ride cannon.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
For me it is.

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,160
I am a ride or die for Islands of Adventure.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I fucking love it.

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Oh boy.

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Unabashedly.

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
It is funny because this is like one of the...

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,280
This is still the first 10 episodes of this podcast and this is one of the ones we've

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,360
chosen and it doesn't make any sense.

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,440
We've done, yeah, the essentials in the beginning.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,280
The Spider-Man Rocks, the musical, the Ellen's Energy Adventure and...

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,440
And then argued with Mike Mitchell a little.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,480
About nothing too specific.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
Just general stuff.

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Like a feeling.

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
We argued about feelings mostly.

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Yeah.

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Talked about your shared Ithaca experience.

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Yeah.

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
There was like 20 minutes on that I think.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
I believe so.

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Yeah.

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
The cafeteria at Ithaca.

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Yeah, Ithaca's weird current...

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Thrilling than any theme park.

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Well, hey, well, yeah, we're still...

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,240
First 10, we're bringing those bangers.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,920
We're taking you to Deadly Do-Rites, Ripsaw Falls.

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
But first...

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
First...

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
We're gonna be some theme park world hoppers today.

66
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,240
We're gonna take you all around the theme park universe into a very, very odd place

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,120
that I just learned about that is a theme park that has not been open for even a year

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,000
at this point, I don't believe.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,600
A place called Motion Gate Dubai.

70
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,720
And the big news out of this place pretty recently, within the last month, at least

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,460
of us recording, is that they have opened the World of the Hunger Games.

72
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,440
It is the first actual Hunger Games theme park experience, and it is not coming to one

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,160
of the major US parks.

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,080
It is straight to Dubai.

75
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
And it's...

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,720
I think the major theme park property opening first in Dubai is sort of unprecedented as

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,800
far as I know.

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah, Dubai...

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Dubai has had a lot of failed theme park stuff.

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,440
I believe there is that indoor theme park that has Marvel stuff.

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,800
A lot of stuff in Dubai is in domes because it is so hot in the desert, and you also have

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,960
to account for sand storms.

84
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,280
Right, because if it was outside and you were on a roller coaster, you would just get a

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,040
mouth and eye full of sand.

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,800
And that wouldn't be good for the guests.

87
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Giant clumps.

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Because in your eye, your eye literally replaced by a pocket of dust.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,240
And you would probably find these people dead with a belly full of sand.

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,120
It would be a nightmare.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,840
You just have to account for atrocities every once in a while, as opposed to a typical US

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,640
park where a death is totally unexpected.

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,360
At an outdoor Dubai park, it's par for the course.

94
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,720
Dubai is also the insane hyper theme park of the world.

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
There's just giant buildings.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There's an indoor mountain that you can go skiing on.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,200
Do they have all those man-made islands where it's like islands in the shape of the states?

98
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
States or countries?

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes, I believe that's Dubai.

100
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,720
Like Elton John bought the fake Florida island or something.

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,380
Someone bought, some very rich man bought the fake Florida island that was man-made

102
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
in Dubai.

103
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,400
I don't know, maybe it's not Elton John.

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,480
So a lot of this stuff built by at best underpaid labor, at worst slave labor from around the

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
world.

106
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
That's a good point too.

107
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,720
Oh God, we're never going to get to go to Dubai.

108
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,680
We'll never be flown to motion gauge now.

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
We've got to cut this off.

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,880
We've got to cut the lid off of everything.

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,360
So what is in the Hunger Gates?

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,400
It's like a roller coaster and a snack bar.

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Is that right?

114
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,040
We got two attractions.

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,360
There's one that looks like sort of a generic roller coaster that could apply to anything,

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,000
but they made it slightly Hunger Games themed called the Capitol Bullet Train.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Do you guys know Hunger Games by the way?

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Cause I don't know what I'm referring to.

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
A little bit.

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
I've seen a couple of the movies.

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
I feel like I've saw the first one and the last one.

122
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
Was there a bullet train that went to the Capitol in one of them?

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,760
I think they take the train to the rich part of this.

124
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Yeah, the Capitol is like where all the rich like one percenters live.

125
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,240
Elizabeth Banks' character, whoever that is.

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, the president is Donald Sutherland.

127
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Right.

128
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,640
And they take this train to, so that's the ride.

129
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
You get on the train.

130
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah.

131
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,760
I don't know if you end up in one percent world.

132
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't know if your life is improved significantly by the end of the ride.

133
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,520
Probably just a roller coaster and it seems like it's outdoors.

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
So watch out for sand gang.

135
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh really?

136
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
But he hadn't emotionally to buy.

137
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,600
Yeah, I think so.

138
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
It seems like I had to repart.

139
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,440
And then, but the one that I could not find a ride through of it.

140
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,000
I couldn't find any footage, but it seems like there's a more avatar Harry Potter S

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,280
mask motion simulator that's more specific called Pan Am aerial tour.

142
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,080
Again, Pan Am, a thing I assume is from the Hunger Games franchise.

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,880
I don't I'm not familiar with Pan Am.

144
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,840
Well, Pan Am.

145
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,440
We let us know what to let us know what Pan Am is.

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,000
We're being nice and specific here.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,520
There there is the thing that I'm interested in is that there is a little bit of actual

148
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,600
content from the stars of the movie.

149
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,160
No Jennifer Lawrence, but you do get intro videos from Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci

150
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,360
as their respective characters.

151
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
F.E. Trinket and Cesar Flickerman.

152
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
There we go.

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
I think I got him right.

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,240
He is very funny.

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,520
He's just playing it at 11.

156
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,480
Like it's it's when you let Stanley Tucci do whatever like when you just let him go.

157
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,520
Like he was in Feud Betty versus Joan as Jack Warner and he's just the most scene chomping

158
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,360
like cigar smoking movie studio exec and he's crazy.

159
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
It's it's pretty fun.

160
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
I mean, it gets very dark, but it's it's fun to watch.

161
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
I should probably see these movies if they have like big full throttle crazy performances.

162
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,320
I'd probably dig them a little bit.

163
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
You're not.

164
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
You're OK.

165
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
They're fine.

166
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
I think it's mostly him.

167
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,440
I think it's mostly him and the rest.

168
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Everyone's doing an OK job.

169
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I see.

170
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I see.

171
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,320
But yeah, but you do get and you can watch these on YouTube.

172
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,520
There are ads with the characters, Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trigget.

173
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
But they do.

174
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,840
They're inside Hunger Games World, but they also say we have it all at Motion Gate, Dubai,

175
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,680
which is very surreal.

176
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,320
I guess it makes Motion Gate Dubai canon within the Hunger Games World, which is I saw some

177
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,320
chatter online people pointing out that it is a little odd that this movie about caste

178
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,600
systems and dystopias is built in a world of caste systems.

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,480
Oh, in Dubai, where if you are a foreign worker, your employer will usually take your passport

180
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,720
when you start working for them.

181
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,760
Yeah, it's a little strange.

182
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
He'll probably give it back.

183
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Yeah.

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,200
Everybody can organize a bust into the passport safe.

185
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
There's options.

186
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
Look, they'll figure it out.

187
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,320
So when Scott brought this up, we were all kind of like, yeah, this is this is weird.

188
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
This Lionsgate branded property at this random park in Dubai.

189
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,760
By the way, as part of a bigger in Motion Gate Dubai, the themed lands are divided up

190
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,040
into it's real sloppy.

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
There's like the world of the Smurfs.

192
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,040
You can go to Smurfs Village and then the other ones are like Columbia Pictures land

193
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,920
and Lionsgate, like as if Lionsgate is like Disney, as if Lionsgate is a brand.

194
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,560
Yeah, we're all super passionate about.

195
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
Well, that brings me to my thing, because Scott brought this up.

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,880
It was like, isn't this weird?

197
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,520
And I was like, it is weird.

198
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,880
And I can do you one better because I had just recently learned about Lionsgate Entertainment

199
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
City.

200
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,200
What is Lionsgate Entertainment City?

201
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,360
The world's first Lionsgate branded indoor entertainment center set to open in New York's

202
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,840
Times Square in 2019.

203
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,240
Finally.

204
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,520
We've all been waiting for something like that.

205
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,960
The Lionsgate family go visit all my favorite Lionsgate characters somewhere.

206
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,120
A real estate developer is like thanking whatever God they worship that someone was able to

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
move into the four story Toys R Us.

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
That was my question.

209
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
It's the Toys R Us.

210
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
I think it is right.

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I don't know.

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,720
I don't know that Toys R Us closed, which is a bummer.

213
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,680
That was a cool, cool ass Toys R Us.

214
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
If you've ever been there, it was like four stories.

215
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,680
There was a big dinosaur, like a full sized dinosaur and a full.

216
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
There's a Ferris wheel.

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
There was an indoor Ferris wheel.

218
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
There was a Ferris wheel.

219
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,200
There was a whole Wonka area with like fun candy.

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,560
But it was all the same.

221
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,360
These things are starting to disappear from Times Square a little bit.

222
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
The giant weird.

223
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,680
The Virgin Megastore is long gone.

224
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,480
That was another big space there.

225
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,360
There's a FAO Schwartz doesn't seem to exist.

226
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,840
The FAO Schwartz was taken over by the Toys R Us and then Toys R Us bought FAO Schwartz,

227
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I believe.

228
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,080
Yeah, I think the big famous FAO Schwartz was further down, like Fifth Avenue.

229
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm thinking of a different.

230
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,360
You can still visit the Plaza Hotel.

231
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,920
You can still visit the Plaza.

232
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,720
Kevin McAllister asked directions from a lovable passerby.

233
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,360
Whatever happened to that man?

234
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
I wish that was the question.

235
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,800
So you may be asking yourself what attractions will be in an indoor theme park in the middle

236
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,720
of Times Square based on Lionsgate properties.

237
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,120
And I'm reading from a crib this from a Deadline article and a variety article.

238
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,640
Attractions will include a Hunger Games flying simulator attraction, which sounds pretty

239
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
close to the Dubai.

240
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
That's the Panem Aerial Tour.

241
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Okay.

242
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,480
Panem is also the nation in the I looked it up was the nation in the Hunger Games.

243
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,720
So it's capital, the capital is the city.

244
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,000
The capital city, Panem is the country.

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sorry, sorry.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Back.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,440
A divergent themed obstacle course, another dystopian teen movie.

248
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,680
The John Wick Chapter 2 shooting ride where fans go head to head with a series of assailants,

249
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:58,960
a 4D film and live theater and a virtual reality entertainment center, including a nerve VR

250
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,440
motorcycle experience.

251
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
What?

252
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,400
You all remember Nerve, right?

253
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,640
The Emma Roberts, Dave Franco banger about an app where I don't have any clue what you're

254
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
talking about.

255
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
What is Nerve?

256
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I really don't know.

257
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,980
I love like knowing stupid bullshit that came out and making fun of it, but I've never heard

258
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
of Nerve.

259
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,640
It's a movie that came out a year ago about like a crowdfunded like app, like a Snapchat

260
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,200
sort of app where you play like a crazy game and the users have to tell you what to do

261
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
and it's one crazy night, but then it starts to get dangerous.

262
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm looking this up.

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,320
I don't have a memory of this.

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
I remember the poster.

265
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,000
It was backwards for some reason.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
Unless I was looking at one that was backwards.

267
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Okay.

268
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
This one is not backwards.

269
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
This one is not bad.

270
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,800
I remember seeing it in a food court and I think it may have been improperly installed.

271
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
It may have been put up backwards.

272
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,280
What is Irvin?

273
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,720
Here, here we go.

274
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
You have the backwards one?

275
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Here's the backwards one.

276
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Whoa.

277
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Yeah, that's right.

278
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
Now why is it backwards?

279
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,840
Is there something about the Nerve app?

280
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,640
I think because it's sick and twisted.

281
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,680
It turns this genre upside, the evil apps come to life genre upside down.

282
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Yeah.

283
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Slash backwards.

284
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,640
I do want to go back and talk about the John Wick chapter two shooting ride, which is a-

285
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,360
Is it called a shooting ride first of all?

286
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,960
It is referred to as a shooting ride.

287
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Cool.

288
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Shootings in Times Square.

289
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,320
In Times Square.

290
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,800
I was talking to a friend of mine from college after we released an early episode and we

291
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,360
mentioned Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers where you would have shot at criminals from a car.

292
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Sure.

293
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Oh yeah.

294
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Never built Disneyland Disney World ride.

295
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,600
Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers.

296
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah.

297
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,040
I remember talking about like, what would that have been bulldozed for?

298
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Probably Star Wars land.

299
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,720
They probably would have been being bulldozed right now for Star Wars land.

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Might have been up in the western.

301
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,160
There's no way that survives the sands of time.

303
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,840
I also think they may have just shut it down after Columbine because if it had opened in

304
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,120
96 when it was supposed to and three, four years later Columbine happens.

305
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
But it wasn't.

306
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,200
Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers wasn't going to take place in a high school.

307
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,440
No, but you were still going to be riding around with like, you know, six shooters shooting

308
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
at people.

309
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I mean, I guess.

310
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Well, do you think it being an actual gun, like a bullet gun makes it a problem as opposed

311
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
to men in black where you're firing weird lasers at aliens?

312
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,600
Lasers at aliens, at like grotesque aliens.

313
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
But a ride where you're a person shooting people is weird.

314
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,840
I think it's worse.

315
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,040
And I mean, John Wick gets gruesome.

316
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
But they weren't.

317
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
I love it.

318
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,360
Like those movies are super fun.

319
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,800
Well, John Wick does seem crazy because those movies are very gory.

320
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,240
But like Dick Tracy, you weren't going to be shooting robots and like blood was going

321
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,880
to shoot out the back of their head or anything.

322
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,040
You were probably going to like shoot their hat and like the hat flipped up or the boat

323
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,680
like the bow tie would spin.

324
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,040
You would shoot the guys bow tie and it would spin like there was no way those guys were

325
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
going to be grizzly murdered.

326
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,320
Now, John Wick 2.

327
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,080
Yeah, that's a that's a more that's a far more realistic where you have to shoot at

328
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,680
virtual common where common plays a rival assassin.

329
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,360
I mean, the thing of Mayor de Blasio is going to shut that thing down.

330
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,080
There's going to be so much commotion.

331
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,600
So there's also more because what themed entertainment center would be complete without retail and

332
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,720
dining establishments, including a Lionsgate Cafe?

333
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Who cares?

334
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,680
A madman themed quote dining and lounge experience.

335
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,400
Oh, now you've got our interest.

336
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,280
Yeah, you've piqued our interest.

337
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,440
That's a thing that weirdos would go to.

338
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh, yeah.

339
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,080
Go dress, go do their own little dapper day at the sure at the mad.

340
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,640
Although can you imagine you live in New York and like going like walking through Times

341
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:58,800
Square, you'd feel like Batman's parents going to see the I'd be so embarrassed.

342
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,160
Or I'd be so mortified to be in public in like madmen clothes walking to the Madmen

343
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Cafe.

344
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:12,440
Well, also like to have it on the green Peter Lute, like all of these like very old establishments

345
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,480
that they eat at and madmen, whether it was filmed on a soundstage or not, are mostly

346
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
still there.

347
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,200
Like, imagine if New York still felt like the 30s.

348
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,920
Well, kind of.

349
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
What else?

350
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,040
The games inspired Peters Bakery and the Capitol Confectionary.

351
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
Oh, they have those also at Dubai.

352
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,280
Dubai is I noticed Peters Bakery is like a baker in the movies.

353
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,640
I think that's a good deduction from the name.

354
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,280
We're Hunger Games experts along with the first ever Lionsgate Studio Store.

355
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,200
Mommy, mommy, I want to go get a souvenir at the Lionsgate Studio Store.

356
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:59,080
I want I want I want a shirt from whatever movie Marlon Wayans finagled them into producing.

357
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,960
I really don't know what's a Lionsgate.

358
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,360
Yeah, we'd have to look like I was just going to I was just going to make a nerve joke.

359
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,520
I was going to make a joke about nerve shirts.

360
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,280
Yeah, buy shirts with you know what?

361
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,240
What we're missing, though, here is I want to say Lionsgate is the studio behind Tyler

362
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Perry.

363
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,960
I think they put out the Tyler Perry movie.

364
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Right.

365
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,960
So that seems like if anything in Lionsgate world, you want to go like a media walk around

366
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,520
to be so exciting.

367
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,760
One of three or four like it takes three or four studios and production companies to put

368
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,560
out any movie nowadays.

369
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah, there was one last.

370
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,840
The Entertainment Center will also feature party rooms for private events and special

371
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,320
programming that can be customized for Lionsgate properties.

372
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,800
Everyone slide in your favorite.

373
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
So you can do so.

374
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,680
They put out Power Rangers.

375
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,160
They did La La Land.

376
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Oh, oh, boy.

377
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,560
They have My Little Pony.

378
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,640
They have the Expendables.

379
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,440
So a live La La La La La Land live.

380
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
Now, that's a theme park show you want to see.

381
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
The Twilight movies.

382
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Huh?

383
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,720
I mean, you were right about the Tyler Perry connection.

384
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,680
OK, the big sick.

385
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,180
Hey, come on.

386
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,560
The big sick first aid clinic.

387
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,760
Come on.

388
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,480
We got to get out of here before they bill us.

389
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,280
We got to get out of this hospital.

390
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
If they send it in the mail, maybe they'll forget about the billing.

391
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,480
So this is I mean, the thing about this is it really seems like they're trying to pitch

392
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,840
it as like, hey, America and the world, you know, Lionsgate.

393
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,800
Y'all love Lionsgate, right?

394
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:45,440
Because like when Disney when Universal opened their Florida park, like they had they had

395
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,680
like a decade and a half of just like giant blockbusters to pull from and movies that

396
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
felt iconic.

397
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,600
E.T. is a huge iconic pretty quick.

398
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,640
You know, like that's a Univeral movies.

399
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,860
And they also had the Hollywood Park to go like, well, this work there and we can probably

400
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,160
make it bigger in Florida or this didn't work.

401
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,880
So we're not going to we're not going to build the Miami fight stunt show.

402
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,440
And then so they had a lot of properties.

403
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,800
And I think they would have they would have had the license, some of the Hitchcock stuff

404
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
for that show.

405
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,720
And they had a license Ghostbusters because they didn't put that out.

406
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,640
And then when Disney opened the original MGM studios, that's mostly like licensed stuff,

407
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,100
like the first few years Star Wars, Indiana Jones, because like Disney's movie fortunes

408
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,880
were not great in the 70s and 80s.

409
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,480
Like a condor man.

410
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,640
They couldn't build a condor man.

411
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Yeah.

412
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,560
Black hole, black cauldron, the rescuer, like stuff that did OK.

413
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,880
But it wasn't until like that, you know, the stuff that they talk about in Waking Sleeping

414
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Beauty documentary, their big like Little Mermaid, Aladdin.

415
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:00,840
So but like Lionsgate, I mean, I should also add when I searched like Lionsgate financials,

416
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,920
the first article that came up was from like the start of 2016.

417
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,240
And the headline was Lionsgate shares plummet following disappointing earnings.

418
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Do you get to go on a ride that simulates their earnings?

419
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Whoa.

420
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,480
We've been rebranded.

421
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,680
Unhappy shareholder animatronics.

422
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,680
But that's that's what happens with some of these these in the Middle East and some of

423
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,800
these licensed parks that never got made or even in Europe and around the world.

424
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,600
All this stuff that gets made in the money just isn't there.

425
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,640
So it's like that Lionsgate is going all in on themed themed entertainment.

426
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,520
It seems like an odd business to get into if you if your studio is not as established

427
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
as as Disney.

428
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,880
And also from what I can tell about Motion Gate Dubai, I was looking at videos from this

429
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,200
park and like Stanley Tucci saying come to Motion Gate Dubai.

430
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
That has like 400 views.

431
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,860
None of the videos of Lionsgate World have any views.

432
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,840
And I saw another video of people like they're a little video diary like our day at Motion

433
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,360
Gate Dubai, a park to ourselves.

434
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,160
Clearly, they are documenting that nobody else is in this park.

435
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
So it's yeah, I don't know.

436
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
They're off to a weird start.

437
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
It's a weird guy.

438
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
I looked at I looked forever to find the video of that one.

439
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
And I can't think of the name of the park in Dubai that has it as Marvel.

440
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,000
It has Adventure Time for whatever reason from Cartoon Network.

441
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,040
Like there's an Adventure Time ride time world you can go into.

442
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
But it's all indoors.

443
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,080
It feels like a bad Mall of America ride.

444
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,120
They all feel like and like there was a boot ride at the Luxor.

445
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Yeah, exactly.

446
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,280
Like a ride, but kind of chintzy.

447
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Right, right.

448
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,200
But I could I was trying to find these videos forever.

449
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,480
And then finally I got one and it's empty in there.

450
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,680
No one's in there.

451
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
It's depressing.

452
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,140
The lights are down like there's a Marvel ride that's just they look like repurposed

453
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
carnival rides.

454
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,080
And then there's one 3D movie that I don't couldn't find video of the Adventure Time

455
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,380
ride is like it's just cardboard things of the characters.

456
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,360
And you're like, oh, they didn't spend any money like they're trying to do a Disney thing,

457
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,980
but they're not going to spend any money.

458
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,280
And no one gives a shit.

459
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,200
And being in a chintzy theme park, you really feel you feel it, especially if you've been

460
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,880
in a better theme park.

461
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Yeah, yeah.

462
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,440
And the pictures I saw of Motion Gate Dubai felt very I was noticing like no trees, no

463
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
vegetation.

464
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,600
They don't feel very lived in.

465
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,920
It reminded me a lot of the Disney Studios Paris, which I got to go to, which we haven't

466
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,800
I don't think we've talked about on here, but it's like a very chintzy park that uses

467
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,800
the excuse of like it sounds stages to have no decoration or charm whatsoever.

468
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,640
Yeah, it's weird.

469
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,560
I think you have to spend money to make money at these theme parks.

470
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I don't think you can have these places also in like Dubai is like a playground for the

471
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,520
hyper hyper rich.

472
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,560
Like there is there was an article a few years back written by George Saunders, MacArthur

473
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,700
genius George Saunders, author of the recent novel Lincoln in the Bardo and a bunch of

474
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,440
short story collections.

475
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,680
He was paid by I think it was GQ or Esquire to go and write about Dubai, like go to Dubai

476
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,760
and write about it.

477
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:23,120
And like his he went to a hotel, like not even like the fanciest hotel, like a Hilton

478
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,000
or something in Dubai, but like still a hyper fancy version of Hilton.

479
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,760
And like his GQ corporate credit card was almost declined.

480
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,800
And he's like, oh my God, I'm not going to have a place to sleep in fucking Dubai.

481
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:43,400
He's going to end up like respected writer, George Saunders, respected writer and and

482
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,920
just eaten sand.

483
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah.

484
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,880
And wandered around and was just kind of like amazed and also mystified at like this place

485
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,260
of like the highest of high of like, well, they built an indoor mountain and these children

486
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,480
are seeing snow for the first time and it's manmade.

487
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
It's like.

488
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Right.

489
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,000
So what you're saying is if this Lionsgate Park and the Hunger Game Park is going to

490
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,120
work there, these rich men need to be able to hunt children for real.

491
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
That's what has to happen.

492
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,000
If these people are going to be satisfied with their experience, there's no way they're

493
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
going to go and see a screen of we're going to fly over where the battle would happen.

494
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,840
No, they have to have a bow and arrow and be able to shoot children and win the Hunger

495
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Games.

496
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,240
The actual Hunger Games have to happen for this thing to be a real success.

497
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,760
You can feel the cheapness of fake child blood.

498
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
That's right.

499
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,520
The 3D blood isn't going to be good.

500
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Yeah.

501
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,760
You need to taste that child's blood on your tongue.

502
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,080
And feel the sense of satisfaction.

503
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,560
You get for murdering a boy.

504
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,520
Have an animatronic Donald Sutherland sleepily tell you, like, good job.

505
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,200
If this is Dubai, let's get Donald Sutherland and just pay him a ton of money to be there

506
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
every day.

507
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,880
Like, come on, let's not fuck around here.

508
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,960
It's been a good deal.

509
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,520
They put me up at the Hilton.

510
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,080
It's an OK hotel, close enough.

511
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,280
All right.

512
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,880
That's the best I could do with Donald Sutherland impression.

513
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
I guess we can say we're cautiously optimistic about these places.

514
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
But guys, step it up.

515
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
And kids, volunteer as tribute.

516
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,720
That said, we'd love to be at the opening of the Lionsgate Entertainment Center.

517
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,520
Yeah, well, let's take a second to kiss up after we've shit all over Lionsgate.

518
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,880
After we've portrayed Dubai as a barbaric state.

519
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
We'll take a free trip, though.

520
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
But New York, we love.

521
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh, the charm of New York.

522
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
We love Times Square.

523
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,440
We love you, Mayor de Blasio.

524
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,760
We love, yeah, we love the we can't buy big sodas and.

525
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,120
We love it.

526
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:56,320
Hey, well, send us to Dubai and we'll be right back.

527
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,880
Welcome back to Podcast The Ride.

528
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,240
We are now going to get to the main event, the thing we're so excited to talk about.

529
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Here we go.

530
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,360
Dudley, do writes rips off all the falls Dudley.

531
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,000
You've been asking for it ever since we started the pod.

532
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,280
Yep, we've gotten all the tweets and we are going to deliver opening day attraction at

533
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,520
Island of Adventure May 28th, 1999.

534
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,520
The world was changed with Dudley do writes rips off falls came on the scene.

535
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
Uh huh.

536
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,980
So ever changed the flume experience despite being right next to another flume with the

537
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,360
Jurassic Park ride.

538
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Yeah, it's fine.

539
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,260
There's a couple of flumes there, but the better flume.

540
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,040
This is a flume for the whole family.

541
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
So yeah.

542
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,400
So 1999, as you said, Islands of Adventure opens.

543
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,440
That's the second theme park in Universal Orlando.

544
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
It's right.

545
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,880
It was designed to have different islands with different properties and characters.

546
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,660
So like you would get a Marvel land and you would get a Dr. Seuss land.

547
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,560
And like those to me make sense.

548
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,640
Well, so here's the thing.

549
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Yes.

550
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
Islands of Adventure was supposed to be a very different park.

551
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,040
It was supposed to be called Universal's cartoon world.

552
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,360
And it was supposed to be like a joint effort with Warner Brothers so that they could have

553
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,520
the Looney Tunes in there and the DC Comics characters in there.

554
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,760
They had Dr. Seuss on it sounded like from the beginning and they had the J ward.

555
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Right.

556
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
So like Rock and Bowling called Dudley do write Peabody and Sherman.

557
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,660
And then the Warner Brothers stuff fell apart.

558
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,920
So they had to scramble to like figure out what they were going to do.

559
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,760
Suddenly have some empty islands.

560
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah.

561
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,840
And so like for and so but then Jurassic Park like hit really big at the box office.

562
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,600
So they're like, well, that's an island.

563
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You're in.

564
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Great.

565
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
That's in Marvel.

566
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,340
The comics, the 90s comics bubble burst.

567
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,680
So like Marvel's fortunes were quickly declining.

568
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
So they're like, with the stunt show.

569
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Yeah.

570
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Marvel is in dire straits.

571
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,760
It's pre pre cinematic universe.

572
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Yeah.

573
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
So they're far less valued.

574
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,040
So a lot of necessity is the mother of invention.

575
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,720
The Lost Continent, which I do like.

576
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,360
I think it's a neat area, but it's all public domain mythology and fables and stuff that

577
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
you don't have to send bad.

578
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,520
They call them Sinbad in case you don't check out episode three.

579
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,560
Yeah, it's true.

580
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
But yeah.

581
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
And what?

582
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
And yeah.

583
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Poseidon is in there.

584
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Poseidon.

585
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Yeah.

586
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Nobody owns Poseidon.

587
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,560
That was his catchphrase.

588
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:44,320
But supposedly there is on another one of our competitors to see some past podcast.

589
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,560
A competitor shot fired across the bow at a different theme park podcast.

590
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,960
A guy named Phil Hedema.

591
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,480
There's an episode with a guy named Phil Hedema and he was one of the people who worked on

592
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,080
the islands park and he seemed to imply that there's like looney tunes.

593
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,560
There's a drawer somewhere with concept art for like looney tunes, e-ticket attractions

594
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,000
like a Bugs Bunny ride, a Duck Dodgers ride.

595
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Sounds great.

596
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah.

597
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Phil Hedema.

598
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
Look, we got great guests too.

599
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
We got Mike Mitchell talking about the Ithaca Cafe.

600
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,880
Get out of here, Phil Hedema.

601
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,920
I also remember and I couldn't find this, but I remember another theme park podcast

602
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,840
where someone else who worked on it said when they were building like the Toon Lagoon, which

603
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,800
is where the Dudley Do-Right ride is, some days someone would just stick their head in

604
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,920
and they're like, we're okay to use Cathy.

605
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,960
Like we're good on Beatle Bailey.

606
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,880
So they would just be adding stuff in last minute.

607
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,560
So if you haven't been before, you walk through the Marvel and you walk through the entrance

608
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,640
and you get to Toon Lagoon, which is where this Dudley Do-Right ride is, and it is covered

609
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
in pictures of comic strips.

610
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,720
It's just random assortments of comic strips that were old for the time.

611
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,520
In the nineties, they were already like your grandfather loved Beatle Bailey.

612
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,680
Family circus, Mark Trail.

613
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,040
So yeah, so I was trying to find a list of all the different properties represented in

614
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,800
Toon Lagoon and I could not, but what I did is I went back to pictures I took in August

615
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
when I was there.

616
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,760
So did you hit them all?

617
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,800
So I tried to get them all just because I was, I'm so fascinated by this and how bizarre

618
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,600
it is even for the nineties, because the nineties was about extreme and attitude and Sonic the

619
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,800
Hedgehog and the Noid.

620
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,240
Those were like cool characters and a lot of these characters were not cool.

621
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,640
They're like families who argue over dinner.

622
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah, like or don't or just have a nice dinner or like satire.

623
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That doesn't make any sense.

624
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,120
Is there a Doonesbury?

625
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,200
I also take these same, every time I am down there, I take these same pictures.

626
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,640
Sure, no, we all have these pictures.

627
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
We all have these pictures.

628
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm not saying I'm unique to that.

629
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,320
The upside down, where if you tilt, you're the person taking the photo has to tilt it

630
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,600
and you hold a rope that's dangling down and it makes it look like you're sideways and

631
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,760
Marmaduke is dragging you furiously.

632
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,160
I have a couple different versions of that and different outfits.

633
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,320
All ages, all times of your life.

634
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,240
Happy and sad, Marmaduke was always there dragging you.

635
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm charted.

636
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
My height is charted on that ride.

637
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,720
We mark it every time I go.

638
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,200
Okay, so here we go.

639
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,840
So there's Heathcliff.

640
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,680
Heathcliff is in a mound of garbage and he's got a fishing line and he's trying to like,

641
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,000
he's stealing a bone from the dog Spike.

642
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
You remember the Heathcliff strip and Spike, all those characters.

643
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Sure.

644
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,320
And by the way, now you've just covered the most major character in the comics portion

645
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
of Family Grants.

646
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,120
Well, yeah, well, Popeye, Popeye's kind of there.

647
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,920
Popeye was famous for cartoons.

648
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Popeye is there making comics.

649
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,840
Also a very early like broadsheet comic strip before the cartoon.

650
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,400
So he kind of hits a lot of, checks a lot of boxes.

651
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
I think there's a couple arguments to be made.

652
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,760
Who's the most famous of all of these weird characters?

653
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,040
So we could spend all day arguing if Betty Boop is more popular than Popeye, which I

654
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
might argue that she is.

655
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Is there?

656
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,960
I don't know if so, but from like merch and like saucy pajama pants.

657
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,840
I think that's what she's known for.

658
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,160
She's on like, you know, like, I feel like she's always weirdly, it's always something

659
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,480
about like, like a cherry or so.

660
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,640
There's always something suggestive with Betty Boop.

661
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,840
And she's like holding a big like heart shaped candy box and it says like chocolate makes

662
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
me horny.

663
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,360
Yeah, they have gotten legitimately sexualizing of Betty Boop.

664
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,880
Confusing, because she is clearly from the 1940s and I think from her head, clearly a

665
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
baby.

666
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,360
Betty Boop is a baby and any sexualizing of her is wrong.

667
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
Her voice is a baby's voice.

668
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Yeah, that's right.

669
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Yeah, she is.

670
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
It's an odd.

671
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
It's an odd thing.

672
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
And she's lasted without having any sort of TV or movie.

673
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,320
And she's always been, no matter the state of the culture, she's always been very thirsty.

674
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Well that's her whole thing.

675
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,760
Yeah, she's a thirst trap.

676
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
She's a walking.

677
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
What do you mean by thirsty?

678
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Horny.

679
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
He's talking about her now.

680
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,000
It's a young person's term for horny.

681
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,520
Well you're the one of us who's single who's on the dating scene.

682
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I am single.

683
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,280
I'm also the youngest, I believe.

684
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,800
If I told my wife I was thirsty, she'd first say what and then.

685
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,840
Give you a glass of lemonade.

686
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,800
Once I explained it, I'd be kicked out of the apartment for two weeks.

687
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,320
I have some other other properties.

688
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
No, I mean.

689
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
You have more.

690
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I got them all.

691
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
I got them all.

692
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Maybe all.

693
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,240
So Shoe, do you remember Shoe, the comic strip Shoe, about a bird who's an editor at a newspaper?

694
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
We got nerve.

695
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,080
We got the nerve characters in their comics.

696
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,880
Shoe is different from Mallard Fillmore.

697
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Yes.

698
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Another animal who works at a...

699
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,960
Yeah, Mallard Fillmore is totally different than Shoe.

700
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
What is Shoe?

701
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Explain the characters of Shoe.

702
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,960
I mean, as far as I remember, he says a good editor never sleeps.

703
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,800
And I don't, that's all I remember is that neither does his steps.

704
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,840
So he's just a bird who works at a newspaper.

705
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,920
That's all I really remember.

706
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,200
He's like a bird, George Saunders.

707
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,760
Yeah, that's a good way to think of it.

708
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Great.

709
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Of course we have Kathy.

710
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,840
Kathy is the ice cream window.

711
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Right.

712
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
She is.

713
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
She's...

714
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,280
She has an ice cream cafe, the thing that she wants to avoid at all, because she stress

715
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
eats.

716
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,960
And now there's, now she has unlimited ice cream.

717
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Now she's on a mountain.

718
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,400
She's in a bathing suit sitting on top of a mountain of ice cream.

719
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
She's got her legs like spread open.

720
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
It's weird.

721
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
It's like totally weird to have Kathy.

722
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,360
Spoon like a food mad maniac.

723
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Poor Kathy.

724
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:47,080
It's probably her, one of her trademark fantasies about surfing or like sitting in a giant tub

725
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
of ice cream.

726
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,920
But wait, why would you, you're in a bathing suit on an ice cream mountain?

727
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,200
All right, we gotta keep moving.

728
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,560
We will be here for hours.

729
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,840
We still haven't talked about Dudley.

730
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:04,600
Jason is upset because this is one of his fantasies to be in a giant tub of ice cream

731
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
in a bathing suit.

732
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm excited.

733
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I'm just kidding.

734
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,120
In a one, Jason in a one piece bathing suit like Donald Duck used to wear.

735
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,200
Hey, now everybody's getting thirsty.

736
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
There's all these characters.

737
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,440
I don't remember any of their names.

738
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,400
There's just a redheaded woman who cries.

739
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Jason, do you know who this is?

740
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I don't know who that is.

741
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,920
Is she a specific character or is she just like a tribute to film noir, to noir, uh,

742
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,720
rec training kind of.

743
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah.

744
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,680
There, there was a lot of, uh, serialized like crime.

745
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,280
There was more adventure strips back in the day.

746
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,840
Serious comics like Dick Tracy, like they do not have the rights to, um, I'm skipping

747
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,400
over Nancy and sluggo.

748
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,520
You can get a, there's a standup with Nancy and sluggo, which I love.

749
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,960
Like Nancy was saving this for the end because, okay, cause we'll go, we'll go right to Nancy

750
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
and sluggo.

751
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Nancy there.

752
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
There's another weird thing.

753
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,680
The bathrooms, the bathrooms are themed to gasoline alley, which is a very old, old comic

754
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
strip.

755
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,480
I don't know a single one of these.

756
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,040
Uh, here's a, did it was gasoline alley, but like incontinent people,

757
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,080
I think it was people worked at a garage.

758
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
They were mechanics.

759
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,680
I believe here's sluggo Scott.

760
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Oh, he's the little pale guy.

761
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
And I hate to, I'm sorry, sluggo.

762
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,880
I'm sorry to insult sluggo, but he looks like a human version of curious George.

763
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,580
He kind of looks like a, I've sent, I've sent a picture of sluggo to a mutual friend of

764
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,080
Jason and I, and they all go, oh, it's Jason.

765
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,760
I walked right into that.

766
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,560
I mean, so, so, but I looked up, yeah, it's sluggo's lovable.

767
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,360
But here I, so I looked up sluggo's biography.

768
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,240
This is a side note, but I feel like we needed to share cause when are we going to talk about

769
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
sluggo again?

770
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Okay.

771
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,180
So this is, this is the bio.

772
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,800
This is what the character like his history and whatever sluggo Smith is Nancy's best

773
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,800
friend introduced in 1938 sluggo is Nancy's agent is a poor ragamuffin type from the wrong

774
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,040
side of the tracks.

775
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,560
He has sometimes described as Nancy's boyfriend.

776
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,240
He has portrayed as lazy and his favorite pastime seems to be napping.

777
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,160
He lives at seven 20 drab street in an abandoned house he found.

778
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,640
And according to a storyline in 2013 strips is taken care of by his truck driver uncles

779
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,660
in parentheses, less and more who discovered that he had lived in an orphanage.

780
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,400
His mother died after he was born and his father died serving his country sluggo's

781
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,400
uncle Vince is a is shady and his rich aunt Maggie in California doesn't care about him

782
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,000
because he reminds her of when she was poor sluggo ran away from the orphanage and his

783
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,520
cousin Chauncey gave him $200 and he took the train as far as three rocks.

784
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:47,040
So we, the most thirties specific character you could imagine.

785
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,120
Also I feel like it's, it's worth mentioning.

786
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,580
Like the Nancy comic strip was originally very different.

787
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,400
It mostly focused on her saucy attractive aunt and then they introduced Nancy, like

788
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,560
her lovable funny niece and everyone's like, uh, we like Nancy more than just this, uh,

789
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
weird aunt character.

790
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,120
So it's like when Fonzie kind of took over happy days, pretty much.

791
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:17,720
And uh, except Nancy perhaps not as dynamic as Fonzie or Urkel.

792
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,320
Uh, Nancy pretty dynamic.

793
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,360
I mean, Nancy gets up to some real mischief.

794
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,320
You're talking to Jason's girlfriend, Nancy.

795
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Nancy.

796
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,400
Uh, I, my nap buddy, they, they, there are like, uh, nice like glossy collections of

797
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,600
the Nancy, like daily comic strips that Fata graphics puts out like every year.

798
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,920
And they're like still pretty funny.

799
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,320
Like it's hard to make humor that like holds up over decades and like the Nancy strips

800
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,160
are very odd, like they're very weird.

801
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Your love for Nancy.

802
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,960
We may end up talking about Nancy and Sluggo on a different episode.

803
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,040
I may be starting a Nancy podcast on Feral Audio.

804
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,320
You do a build your own theme park kind of thing.

805
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,880
Maybe you, you invent the entire Nancy Slug-a-verse.

806
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,360
Oh yeah.

807
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,760
Nancy and Sluggo try to like catch some wily junkyard dogs or whatever people did back

808
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,720
in the 30s.

809
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,320
Get to listen to FDR's far side chats with them, experience politics as they did.

810
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,920
Uh, I, I have a couple of properties.

811
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Yeah, go ahead.

812
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,600
I mean, go for, maybe this is one of them.

813
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,960
Uh, is that the, oh, is that Nemo and Slumberland?

814
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,600
Like Nemo and Slumberland falling out?

815
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,360
Yeah, that's another, that's like a weird.

816
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,440
I don't know what that is.

817
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,400
I've never, Little Nemo and Slumberland.

818
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,920
Little Nemo was, I think the very first newspaper comic strip and, and is like historic in the

819
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,680
world of, uh, uh, comics in general.

820
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,800
Um, and he's just falling off the roof of a building and there's a sinister moon looking

821
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,560
at him at Islands of Adventure.

822
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,920
And it says, he's saying there's a word balloon.

823
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,440
He goes, oh, I'm falling out of bed.

824
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
And that's it.

825
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
That's the joke.

826
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,680
And then the moon, yeah, the moon is just staring at him.

827
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,080
In Toon Lagoon, see all of your favorite sad little boys.

828
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Yeah.

829
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,120
Uh, there's a Dagwood restaurant.

830
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,000
Dagwood, the guy who makes real big sandwiches.

831
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
From the strip blondie.

832
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,600
That's from the strip blondie.

833
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Also very thirties.

834
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,960
Cause that's like, you want to live vicariously, uh, through, uh, adventures and comics and

835
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
stuff.

836
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,120
Imagine eating a giant sandwich with a whole fish with the head and tail sticking out of

837
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
it.

838
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,480
Only few people in the thirties get to eat a giant sandwich.

839
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,040
Uh, so I remember eating at that restaurant, like one of the first times my family went

840
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,360
to Islands of Adventure and it is still to this day, one of the worst meals I have ever

841
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
had.

842
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,600
I ordered one of those giant sandwiches and like, it was bad.

843
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,680
And you love theme park garbage food.

844
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Yeah, sure.

845
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
So that's saying something.

846
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm not saying I don't either.

847
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm saying it really must have been bad.

848
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
It's bad.

849
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Yeah.

850
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,720
Deli sandwiches are not a good pick at theme parks.

851
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,400
Like I would avoid, but usually I would avoid lunch, lunch meats, unless they're like slicing

852
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
it fresh.

853
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,640
Like, uh, they do not slice it fresh at Dagwood's sandwich shop.

854
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
Islands of Adventure.

855
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
No.

856
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,800
But the sandwich on the outside of the Dagwood restaurant is disgusting.

857
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,160
I saw a photo of it.

858
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,800
If that didn't, I don't know, if that didn't turn you off, then maybe you deserve it.

859
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
Um, yeah, I probably did.

860
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Uh, you should have known what you were getting yourself into.

861
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,840
There was also the Wossamatta U store.

862
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,980
That is of course, Bullwinkle's alma mater.

863
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,200
He went to Wossamatta U. Uh, that, that when it first opened, sold rock and Bullwinkle

864
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:35,760
merchandise and from my memory, very quickly morphed into an internet cafe, a popular trend

865
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,720
in the early 2000s, a place where people would go and pay for internet access.

866
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,200
Was it like a place at Islands of Adventure where you could go check AOL or whatever?

867
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Yeah.

868
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,840
Check AOL, check your email, like that sort of thing.

869
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,800
Which would have been, I think I went when I was like a pissed off teen in 2002 or something.

870
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,120
I probably like, let me check my email.

871
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Yeah.

872
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
My girlfriend emailed me.

873
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:01,200
That's probably, yeah, yeah, that serves a function.

874
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,560
And last time I was there, I think it sold phone cases and minions t-shirts, uh, like

875
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,120
most stores at Islands of Adventure.

876
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,160
So they have not determined that they needed a full time Rocky and Bullwinkle specific

877
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
store.

878
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
No.

879
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,240
The only real merch or the most, most of the cartoon merch that sold there is Popeye stuff

880
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,080
and Betty Boop stuff in August when we were there.

881
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,600
And the Popeye stuff is straight up bizarre.

882
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,360
It's like Popeye breaking bad parody shirts.

883
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,040
And it's like B, like BR, which is the symbol, uh, which for what?

884
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,800
One of the elements table spinach.

885
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,280
And then it's like bros and it's just Popeye and, and it's Bluto.

886
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,840
Is that Bluto is the character's name?

887
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Yeah.

888
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Pete is from Disney.

889
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Yeah, they're very similar.

890
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
They're grumpy sailors.

891
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Yes.

892
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Uh, yeah.

893
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,100
Popeye and wimpy.

894
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,240
There's always, there's price and wimpy shirts.

895
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,640
Pete's hamburger window was not open when I was there at the end of Summer.

896
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,000
Wimpy another character that you've been compared to many times.

897
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,520
Another character I've been compared to.

898
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,360
He's kind of like a grown sluggo a little bit.

899
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Yeah.

900
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Yeah, pretty much.

901
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Fan theory.

902
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,040
Sluggo is, sluggo grew up into wimpy.

903
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,800
By Pokemon rules, a sluggo evolves into a wimpy.

904
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,960
And finally into a Jason.

905
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,280
The other Toon Lagoon thing that place itself food is another Popeye character who I know

906
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,600
you have a lot of affection for.

907
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,080
Um, it's, it's Popeye's father.

908
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,560
Uh, poop deck Pappy.

909
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah.

910
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,040
So Popeye's father is just Pappy.

911
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,040
Sure.

912
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,640
Popeye's father is named poop deck Pappy in case anyone, I mean, obviously you guys all

913
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,800
knew that, but in case you didn't know that.

914
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,460
Just catching up any weirdos who aren't up to speed.

915
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,440
What you've done, Jason, I know you've done a lot of research on poop deck Pappy and I'm

916
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
not being faceted, right?

917
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,920
You wrote a sketch about poop deck Pappy.

918
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,920
Yeah.

919
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,200
Me and our past guest Marissa Strickland wrote and did a sketch once about a man whose sexual

920
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,480
kink was a Popeye with like, uh, uh, being Popeye specifics.

921
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,360
Like he had anchor tattoos and spinach was an aphrodisiac and wanted to be called poop

922
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
deck Pappy.

923
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:20,280
So we spent just hours reading about the Popeye mythos and it's, it's very weird.

924
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,720
I'm severely disturbed by all things Popeye.

925
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,920
I find it so unpleasant.

926
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I hate every voice.

927
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,760
The live action movie is very weird.

928
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Yeah.

929
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Yeah.

930
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,600
I mean, I, I directed by Robert Altman starring, uh, Robin Williams, co-directed by cocaine.

931
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,560
But an interesting Harry Nilsen score.

932
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
An interesting Harry Nilsen.

933
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
Yes.

934
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,040
Reprised in punch, drunk love sampled and punch, drunk love.

935
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,200
Um, so that w that would make you think it was a fun and worth checking out again, right?

936
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,000
I, but then I've tried, you put on five minutes of that thing and it's terrifying.

937
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,640
I'm afraid of like see stuff to like giant octopuses and that kind of thing, uh, freak

938
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,640
me out.

939
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,240
And, uh, it's a disturbing movie, but you know how they made people want to go and investigate

940
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,280
Popeye.

941
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,880
You build a Rapids ride and you build a children's play area.

942
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,760
The, the Popeye and Bluedo's bilge rat barges and the children's play area.

943
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,240
Me ship the olive.

944
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,080
Uh, and that's one of the highlights of two lagoon is you leave the, that part of the

945
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,120
park drenching wet.

946
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,720
Like you are, you can just get soaking wet on, on all of the rides there in the Florida

947
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
heat.

948
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,000
All of the, the thing about universal is they're not gentle with you in the water.

949
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,600
Disney's a little more splash bound.

950
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,520
You can still get pretty wet, but we went on a couple of years ago.

951
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,880
Just the Popeye then onto Dudley do rights, rip soft falls.

952
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,240
And we were just soaked.

953
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,280
We was like, we got into a shower or we got into a tub filled with water and we got out

954
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,340
and like every part of you was soaked.

955
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,340
It was impossible.

956
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,120
Like they make you pay to get dry.

957
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,480
It's this evil shit they do.

958
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,920
There's these three or like $5 to get dry.

959
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,520
And it's like, well, I don't want to pay.

960
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,160
It's still kind of hot, but then you're walking around miserable and there's the dryers only

961
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,960
you're located outside those rides and it's a very cruel thing they do to you.

962
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,320
Getting wet at the theme park is something I may have retired from as an adult.

963
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Can you imagine that?

964
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,600
I don't want to walk around with like a wet wallet.

965
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,600
Oh, my father.

966
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,600
Yeah.

967
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
My father hates it.

968
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,000
Like he's always like, we're doing that last and I'm going back to the hotel.

969
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,560
Like he doesn't like, I love it.

970
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,000
Cause I think I love getting wet.

971
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,960
He loves wet pants at a theme park.

972
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,360
I sloppy sandwich after.

973
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,760
I think it's really fun.

974
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,120
Like I think all this park too, with the way it was originally designed, like you would

975
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,920
hit to a lagoon, do all these water rides and then you would go around the bend to Jurassic

976
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,480
park and another water ride.

977
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,240
So it's kind of smart the way they put all of that stuff next to each other and get dried

978
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,040
off by dueling dragons that serve the air.

979
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,120
Suction serves as a natural dryer.

980
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,720
And now there's a fucking air conditioned Kong Kong ride right in the middle to make

981
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
you very cold.

982
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Yes.

983
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
Yeah.

984
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Yeah.

985
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,920
Die of hypothermia.

986
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,960
So let's get to the, unless do you have another thing or do you want to get to the actual

987
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
ride itself?

988
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
I have a question.

989
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Sure.

990
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,960
Sure.

991
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
Which is, so now we've set the scene.

992
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,240
We've taken you all the way through to lagoon up to our, our highlight ride, but why did

993
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,960
we all agree that Dudley do writes Ripsaw falls was worth an episode, but not Popeye

994
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,240
and Bluto's build rat barges?

995
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,400
Ripsaw falls to me feels like it's the better ride.

996
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,400
It is the better ride.

997
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Yeah.

998
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,360
I think it's got a more coherent story.

999
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,200
I guess it is a more coherent story.

1000
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,960
I feel like all, I feel like they're both a little half-assed argument, well, or a story

1001
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,640
wise, but I, although, uh, I don't know if you guys caught this, but I, I was watching

1002
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,440
some making of videos and behind the scenes video that, that, uh, made the Popeye story

1003
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,240
sound a lot more complicated than I knew, which is that, apparently the story is that

1004
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:03,040
when you get on Popeye is going to like take you around a river, like a nice river, uh,

1005
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
it's going to be very calm.

1006
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,200
And then Bluto steals you.

1007
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,960
He like makes a false turn in the queue or something to where you don't know until you're

1008
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,920
on it that you're on Bluto's build rat barges.

1009
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,840
So he like obscons with you and then you're on a ride, which they failed to convey.

1010
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
Right.

1011
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
I don't know.

1012
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,840
I don't know.

1013
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,440
I feel like I remember one or two signs that are like normal signs.

1014
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,560
And then it has like a fake, like shitty paint cross out and a fake, like, you know, arrow

1015
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
this way.

1016
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,560
That's what's happening.

1017
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
So a little trick.

1018
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,080
Bluto is stealing you.

1019
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,120
So that, now you guys have got to compete with them.

1020
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,760
Maybe that's my role on this podcast.

1021
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,740
I will argue Popeye versus Dudley Do-Right.

1022
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,600
But look, you got a pretty big twist in that ride is the, can the storytelling of Dudley

1023
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,040
Do-Right top that the complexity of build rat barges?

1024
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
I mean,

1025
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,040
No, I don't know.

1026
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,040
I just think it's charming.

1027
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,320
No, I'm holding you to the wall.

1028
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,360
This has to be complex storytelling or I'm out.

1029
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,240
Well, I remember being a kid and at some point Nickelodeon and Nick at night were both showing

1030
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,520
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

1031
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,680
Like they, they, they had this indication rights and they're like, we're just going

1032
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,520
to show it on both.

1033
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,660
We're just going to show it on both.

1034
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,440
So I watched a lot of it a few summers.

1035
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
I do.

1036
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,600
I think probably it starts because I do have more affection for the Jay Ward stuff.

1037
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
Yeah.

1038
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,600
I do for Popeye.

1039
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,160
I enjoyed that as a kid more than I gave a shit about Popeye.

1040
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,680
I like the game.

1041
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,200
I like the old arcade game with Popeye.

1042
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
I liked going to get this.

1043
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Yeah, that was fun.

1044
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,600
But that's probably the thing of Popeye.

1045
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,600
I like the most.

1046
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,600
Sure.

1047
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,640
And like I liked when Wimpy would do the eat a cheeseburger.

1048
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
Did you like Dudley Do-Right?

1049
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,120
I feel like I have consumed very little Dudley Do-Right content in my life.

1050
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
I have.

1051
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,120
That is the thing.

1052
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,760
When I said Jay Ward specifically, because it wasn't like I Dudley was the one I liked

1053
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,860
the best of all the Jay Ward verse.

1054
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:58,720
But the general veneer where it is, I think Simpson's writers will drop Rocky and Bullwinkle

1055
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,320
especially and the Jay Ward stuff.

1056
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
Yeah, because they were like.

1057
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,200
It's snarky and self-aware and kind of a little more adults than other kids' cartoons.

1058
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,160
They were primetime and a little smarter, a little body.

1059
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,160
And more kind of clever and more levels than like Flintstones and Jets.

1060
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Yeah, for sure.

1061
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,800
And I think they were like surface, I mean, like fine shows, but like, yeah, you'd see

1062
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,600
like pop culture references and parodies and stuff.

1063
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,240
And like the kind of storytelling that knows where they know it's a story and step outside

1064
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,520
of it and comment on it.

1065
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
And yeah, I agree.

1066
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
I like the Jay Ward stuff.

1067
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,240
And like what are the bad guys' names in Rocky and Bullwinkle?

1068
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Boris and Natasha.

1069
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:49,920
Like much, much better Cold War Russia jokes than the garbage Russia based humor nowadays.

1070
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,740
Like I don't know, it just seems more fun and more biting.

1071
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:03,040
Like when as it seems more biting to have like these stupid cartoon spies, like just

1072
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,900
being incompetent at trying to kill a moose and a squirrel.

1073
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,920
Like just fucking that up every week.

1074
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
That's the problem.

1075
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,800
The myth of incompetent Russian spies.

1076
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,560
It's no longer applicable.

1077
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,560
That's true.

1078
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,900
It wouldn't make sense now.

1079
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,960
They wouldn't hire Boris and Natasha these days.

1080
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
I guess.

1081
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:28,600
No, they need geniuses to buy shitty Facebook ads that five people click on.

1082
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,960
To fish, fish, podestas and males.

1083
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,200
Just could have fished podesta, John podesta I think.

1084
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,080
So the ride takes the form of like one of these Dudley Do-Right shorts.

1085
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,520
Like you pretty much walk there.

1086
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,440
There's some, there's some moose heads.

1087
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,800
There's some animatronic moose heads talking to you in the queue.

1088
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,800
There's a big movie set.

1089
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Catch a bear.

1090
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,560
A quick note about the heads.

1091
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
There's a bear and a beaver.

1092
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
Oh, excuse me.

1093
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,560
Yeah.

1094
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Right.

1095
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
That's yeah.

1096
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,560
Yeah, you're right.

1097
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Yeah, it's a bear and a beaver.

1098
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,160
So the main two characters, Dom DeLuise, Charles Nelson Riley.

1099
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Wow.

1100
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Awesome.

1101
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
So already a strike.

1102
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Great.

1103
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
A good strike.

1104
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,720
Celebrity con, the Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci of their day.

1105
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,460
There's a big movie screen playing the like safety video and that also kind of like sets

1106
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,520
up the story a little and there's a lot of like theater-y.

1107
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,120
There's like a projector and then like a cartoonishly, a projector prop and like.

1108
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,120
Oh yeah, I like that.

1109
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,760
You're in the, you're going into a movie theater.

1110
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,160
Silent movie, this like, yeah, and this.

1111
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,040
Piany Nickelodeon feel, which is fun.

1112
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Yeah.

1113
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,880
And that's the start of the ride is like the credits of like a little.

1114
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,880
Right.

1115
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,880
And if short.

1116
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,320
If you don't know Dudley Do-Right, like he's basically a parody of old silent movies where

1117
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,520
there would be like old timey piano music and like, oh help, help, the woman is on the

1118
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,520
train tracks.

1119
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,000
And like it's goofing on that, which, which is part of what I'm going to talk about is

1120
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,560
just how bizarre it is to make this ride in 1999.

1121
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,080
It's a parody of something from the early part of the 20th century already.

1122
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,560
In a land that is entirely depressionary.

1123
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,200
But yeah, that's where the whole, that's where like, that's where it starts out this, where

1124
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,400
they got the idea for Dudley Do-Right.

1125
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,400
And in general, this is, I think the odd thing to me, but especially Toon Lagoon, they've

1126
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,520
added new things to islands of adventure, but a lot of islands of adventure has just

1127
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,600
not changed at all since 1999 in any way.

1128
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:33,880
There's been no way to evolve or mod out things like Dudley Do-Right or Popeye.

1129
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,960
So it feels very, so now it's like locked in silent film era stuff via 1999 has not

1130
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,660
changed in almost 20 years.

1131
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,860
And I'm wondering how much of that is money and how much of it is just like, well, people

1132
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,860
still like it.

1133
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,860
It's still reviewed.

1134
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,860
That is true.

1135
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,640
You're not obliged to change up a theme park, right?

1136
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,520
If it's, if it's working and people go on it.

1137
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,400
I feel like Dudley is usually pretty consistent when I go on it.

1138
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Like I think-

1139
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,840
Like the time.

1140
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,600
No, no, just in terms of experience.

1141
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,440
Like stuff is usually working and also like just the ride system is good.

1142
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,320
Like it is a fast log flow.

1143
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,100
Like you go pretty fast.

1144
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,040
Like space, a splash mountain the last few years, I, when I've written it, the logs back

1145
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,960
up a lot and it kind of kills the energy.

1146
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,240
And like that doesn't happen as much on Dudley cause like the flow of the water is fast and

1147
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,120
you go down the drop fast.

1148
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,080
Like, yeah, yeah.

1149
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,480
I think that's why I won't go on it.

1150
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,960
I did it once and yeah, it is a like much more, a much more intense drop because then

1151
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,560
you get that second hill.

1152
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
Like it gets, yeah, it gets pretty fast on.

1153
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,760
I'm still, I'm disturbed even recalling the memory.

1154
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,640
Cause you're not, I don't want to out you, but you've talked about how you don't like

1155
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,680
these rides, these dry, these drop rides.

1156
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,680
I don't go on, yeah, I don't do drops.

1157
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,760
I'm not doing Dr. Doom's fear fall.

1158
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
I'm not doing-

1159
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,760
Well, I agree with you on that.

1160
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,160
You won't do a tower, but you'll do, I don't do a guardians.

1161
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
I don't do tower.

1162
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,120
If I'm enclosed on a giant drop, I'm okay with it.

1163
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,520
But with my legs dangling and it's outside, I don't see the point.

1164
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
You feel too naked.

1165
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,520
You feel too exposed.

1166
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,160
I feel like I'm going to slide out and it's too stressful.

1167
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Yeah.

1168
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
Yeah.

1169
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,440
If only I could go that way.

1170
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,600
You've tried to open the restraints.

1171
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,800
I tried to open, I want to give myself to Dr. Doom and the kingdom of Latamaria.

1172
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,040
I support your mission.

1173
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,680
I support your mission, take my fear juice.

1174
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,720
Yeah, that's true though.

1175
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,840
I don't go on the drop rides, so that'll keep coming up in certain episodes.

1176
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,080
I did go on this one.

1177
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,560
It is fun and decor-wise, but I was terrified going up that hill.

1178
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,320
I'm really freaked out on drop hills.

1179
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,640
I feel legitimately, it's torturous memories.

1180
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,760
Yeah, there's a few little drops too.

1181
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,640
So you're going up and down a lot.

1182
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,040
Yeah, there's like three drops that have significance, kind of like Splash Mountain.

1183
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,600
This is also obviously a parody of Splash Mountain.

1184
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,040
There's a lot of similar, the ride setup is very similar and there's a couple different

1185
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,720
drops before you get to the big one.

1186
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,240
Ooh, my voice cracking.

1187
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:18,040
But hey, so you're in a Dudley Do-Wright cartoon and you're meeting, you're seeing all your

1188
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,160
favorite characters.

1189
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,880
Dudley Do-Wright, Snidely Whiplash, the mustache drooling villain.

1190
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,880
Nell.

1191
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,280
Nell, his girlfriend, or his would-be girlfriend who like kind of doesn't really like him.

1192
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, I guess not.

1193
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
That's the whole thing.

1194
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,760
Like she doesn't, he likes her, but she's like kind of just berates him.

1195
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,160
It's just pure necessity.

1196
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,720
She needs him around for constant saving.

1197
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:49,200
And Nell Fenwick, perhaps the least Bechtel test passing character in cinema history.

1198
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,280
But kind of self-referential to the fact that it's playing on the trope of the woman in

1199
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,280
peril as well.

1200
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,280
Yeah.

1201
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,280
So maybe you could argue.

1202
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
Is, is, is, yeah.

1203
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,920
I wouldn't argue that by the way, but maybe you could.

1204
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,040
I'm not saying there's anything like particularly sexist about the character, just when you

1205
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:10,200
think about it that her only function is one man wants her to be one place and another

1206
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,920
one wants her to be another place.

1207
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,040
I feel like there is jokes.

1208
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,800
There are jokes every now and then where she's like tied to the train tracks and it's like,

1209
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
oh, this again.

1210
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,880
Like, yeah, that must be where they're at.

1211
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,240
Like episode two, right?

1212
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
What else?

1213
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,000
What's another, what's a Dudley do right plot that isn't all the same.

1214
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,240
The one I watched one earlier today and it's just the joke is that snobbly whiplash keeps

1215
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,400
tricking him into being tied to a different woman on the track.

1216
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,120
So he was like, put your finger here.

1217
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
It would make me feel bad.

1218
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,960
He's like, he tries to convince him that he's rehabilitated, but then he just ties a woman

1219
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,280
in the train track and Dudley gets stuck in it and like it happens.

1220
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,560
He keeps happening over and over again.

1221
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,400
I think they say like snobbly whiplash is like his pastime tying women to the train

1222
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
tracks.

1223
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
What's his profession then?

1224
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
That's a good point.

1225
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
How does he make, how does he make a living?

1226
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,760
How does he earn, how does he pay for these fancy hats and suits?

1227
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,180
Yeah, it's the same suit and hat.

1228
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,360
Also why are these kind of, we're in like Canadian Mountie world and then why is there

1229
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,600
this like fancy magician walking around?

1230
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,040
Like he's not particularly rustic.

1231
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,800
I think he's like a Baron, like a robber Baron or a railroad Baron sort of like sinister

1232
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
looking villain.

1233
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Is he like a guy who would own the, the loggery and be siphoning money off of it or investing

1234
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,360
it in shell companies?

1235
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,360
Yeah.

1236
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,280
I assume he's doing like corporate plundering as well as literal plundering.

1237
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,840
That's probably how he's getting his like living money.

1238
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:41,240
So he's a, he's an evil, he's a city corporate influence disrupting the beauty of nature,

1239
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,280
which is why there's a general tension with the parks community.

1240
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
Right.

1241
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,440
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah.

1242
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,640
That's, that's the backdrop at which we set.

1243
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,640
Right.

1244
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
And there's also a horse.

1245
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,640
The horse is funny.

1246
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,080
The horse is like, you know, I think a joke in the Dudley cartoons, the horse is usually

1247
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,520
smarter than him.

1248
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,120
So socioeconomic messages and a funny horse and a funny horse.

1249
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,880
And now like usually sometimes swoons over the horse more.

1250
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,880
Yeah.

1251
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,880
More so than Dudley.

1252
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,600
The joke is that now wants to fuck the horse and not Dudley do right.

1253
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,360
Which is, I mean, what it is, like, they're not going to say that, but like, it's like,

1254
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,600
she kisses the horse at the end of the ride and not Dudley.

1255
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,240
And like, that's a common joke.

1256
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,160
And if you'll allow me just to, uh, you guys keep talking.

1257
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,880
I'm going to see if there's any, uh, uh, rule 57.

1258
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
Oh, please.

1259
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,120
And you guys at home, look that up on your own.

1260
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,840
Cause we're not going to sully our Twitter with such X rated material.

1261
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,800
But if I see any, I'll describe it.

1262
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,760
So you ride through the ride.

1263
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,760
Yeah.

1264
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,440
The Nell gets tied to the train tracks.

1265
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,880
Dudley rides us off on the horse.

1266
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,880
There's a sauce.

1267
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,200
There's a sassy narrator.

1268
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,440
The narrator in the Dudley do right cartoons is like very appointed.

1269
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,800
I believe I could be that could be wrong, but the original narrator, I believe was Paul

1270
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,080
Freese.

1271
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
I think that's right.

1272
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,280
The haunted mansion, a voiceover and great moments from Mr. Lincoln.

1273
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
Uh huh.

1274
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,160
Um, and also the, in the original, uh, Hans Connery, who is, I think the voice of captain

1275
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,600
hook and a lot of early Disney things.

1276
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,800
They got some, some of the really good early Disney voices in this, uh, the J word company

1277
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,600
responsible for, uh, the original design and creation of captain crunch.

1278
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,600
Yes.

1279
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
A lot of cereal.

1280
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
They did a lot of cereals as well.

1281
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,560
I don't remember the quisp mascot, but he was a weird alien.

1282
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,240
Maybe I think he was, I think the quisp mascot was a weird alien.

1283
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,360
We'll have to look that up.

1284
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,360
Uh, yeah.

1285
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,120
So they did a lot of stuff.

1286
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,600
What I do think is weird about is that the big ride, they didn't pick, they picked like

1287
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,840
the mo the fifth most popular J ward property.

1288
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,200
Cause like a big Rocky and bowl Winkle ride would have made sense.

1289
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,360
Cause Rocky and bowl Winkle still was pretty well known in the nineties.

1290
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,160
Had a revival on VHS.

1291
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Yes.

1292
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
I had a Rocky doll.

1293
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,480
Like I, I, I, one that translates the best, I think.

1294
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,480
Yeah.

1295
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,960
Oh, that was part of the, the Disney universal war there for awhile.

1296
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,400
Cause one of them bought the like home video rights for Rocky and bowl Winkle.

1297
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,000
And they were like trying to, they were like bidding over and trying to get them back.

1298
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,240
Cause universal had the theme park, right?

1299
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,160
And they're like, well, we want to put out, we want to sell the f*****g videos.

1300
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,160
Oh really?

1301
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,160
Yeah.

1302
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,680
Which once they got, when universal got those theme park rides, they ended up in the parks.

1303
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,400
Like that's, that's the thing I remember loving from going to universal studios in like 1992,

1304
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,900
like really charming little Rocky bowl Winkle street shows and walk or to get your picture

1305
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,900
with them.

1306
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:45,920
I think my dad was handed a big bomb where the fuse was, that was delightful and he made

1307
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
it.

1308
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,920
He survived everybody.

1309
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:56,480
Death at a theme park today is a large cartoonish bomb went off an understandable mix up.

1310
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,520
He assumed it was a prop and he made a wrong assumption.

1311
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,520
Yeah.

1312
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:09,360
Hey, by the way, I am looking at a GIF of Nell getting double teamed by, indeed I am.

1313
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,720
I'll describe it no further, but I'll show it to us in your way.

1314
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,720
Oh my God.

1315
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,720
It's a minimal animation, not just a,

1316
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Whoa, it's moving.

1317
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,720
Yeah.

1318
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,720
It's a GIF.

1319
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,760
Some fun little, fun little thrush.

1320
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,360
Jesus Christ.

1321
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,280
It does appear though that the horse is wearing a cunt.

1322
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,840
So don't worry.

1323
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
They're playing it safe.

1324
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,840
Save it for you.

1325
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Anyway, back to the ride.

1326
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
All right.

1327
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
Rocking the ride.

1328
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,840
And how much we loved it as kids.

1329
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
Yeah.

1330
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
Rocky Bow Winkle.

1331
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
I liked a lot.

1332
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,640
Peabody and Sherman, I feel like was more popular than Dudley Do-Right as well.

1333
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,440
Like they were very prominent on that show.

1334
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,560
I even think maybe Georgia the Jungle, like I knew the song better.

1335
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,320
Georgia the Jungle was well known.

1336
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,320
So it's, it is kind of odd that they picked Dudley Do-Right.

1337
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,560
Now I'm sure we were going to talk about this anyway.

1338
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,080
This is the same year, and I don't know if you have any information about this.

1339
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,040
This is the same year that the Dudley Do-Right movie came out in theaters.

1340
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,520
I bet I have a feeling that was just fortuitous timing.

1341
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,960
Like that was just luck.

1342
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,960
Yes.

1343
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,000
And I think that it was probably a luck because like they were not so good with the synergy.

1344
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,720
Like these days they're a little bit better about everybody's a bit better about having

1345
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,720
a ride or a thing come up right when the movie starts.

1346
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,200
Getting that Avatar ride out 11 years before Avatar 2.

1347
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
Fair enough.

1348
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,200
That just proves what I just said.

1349
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
But fine.

1350
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
They were trying to coordinate.

1351
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
They were trying.

1352
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Well because of the sequels.

1353
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Yes, the sequels.

1354
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,320
Especially this part of the park.

1355
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:42,840
It seems like they were scrambling to get it done and open and to make a little, a lick

1356
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
of sense.

1357
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,440
I actually, I learned that this ride was going to be delayed and open a year after Islands

1358
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,400
of Adventure, but they cut budgets in order for it to be open in 1999.

1359
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,400
Oh, okay.

1360
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,400
I do think it's pretty slick.

1361
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,040
Like as I was thinking about it, it's like, oh, Toon Lagoon.

1362
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,840
And like the logo has like a lot of splashing water in it and it like, yeah, it's all water.

1363
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,880
So they're like, they tried to lean into the island, like the different sun.

1364
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:14,480
I feel like earlier on there was more like leaning into like the island part of Islands

1365
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,480
of Adventure.

1366
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,400
Like, you know, Tokyo Disney Seaway where water is a component of a lot of the ride.

1367
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Yeah.

1368
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
And there used to be the Skipper.

1369
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,960
I really liked the like junk boat, the Skipper Island tours.

1370
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:31,080
There used to be these like fake looking like junky boats that you could take from the port

1371
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,000
of entry across to Jurassic Park.

1372
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,120
And that lasted, I think, barely two years, like, and it was just for cost.

1373
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,360
I wonder if that's just a char, that's like a charm atmosphere kind of ride and not necessary

1374
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,360
to keep open.

1375
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,480
They also used to do like a big nighttime water show at Islands of Adventure.

1376
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,840
They used to do fireworks from there and that sort of thing.

1377
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,680
And that quickly got sent back over to Universal, Florida.

1378
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:02,840
This is a sidetrack actually, but I, there was a video, I've talked to Mike about this.

1379
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,800
I don't know if I've talked to you about it, there's an Islands of Adventure promotional

1380
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,520
video where you meet a John Hammond, who's clearly a younger man with like dyed white

1381
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,760
hair and beard.

1382
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,400
And he looks exactly like if you dyed yourself with.

1383
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,760
I think Mike sent me a photo of your dad.

1384
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,760
My father.

1385
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,760
Yes.

1386
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
Yeah.

1387
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,080
Apparently, if you, yeah, we think we should do a side by side here and see how accurate

1388
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,080
this is.

1389
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,080
But apparently your dad looks like an off brand John Hammond.

1390
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
Yeah.

1391
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:35,400
Every time we're at a Universal park, someone makes an employee goes like, shouldn't you

1392
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,600
be at the Jurassic Park adventure?

1393
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,240
Like someone makes a joke.

1394
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,960
He's not dragged backstage and put on the clock, is he?

1395
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,960
No.

1396
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,160
You're back to work, Hammond.

1397
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,200
It was only half kind of thought that we would end up comparing most of these characters

1398
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
to you and your family.

1399
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,200
We're up to number seven.

1400
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Yeah.

1401
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
Yeah.

1402
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Yeah.

1403
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Well, I don't know.

1404
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,200
Yeah.

1405
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,200
We haven't gotten mean with it.

1406
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,200
We're not like, and you look like the horse too.

1407
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
Damn it.

1408
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Well, the horse is charming and funny.

1409
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Yeah, you're right.

1410
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
If you're going to be anybody.

1411
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,200
Gets the girl.

1412
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,600
This is why you like Islands of Adventure so much because it seems like home.

1413
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
Oh yeah.

1414
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,640
Like you're looking in a mirror everywhere you go.

1415
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,720
I do have very pot.

1416
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,400
My family always had a great time.

1417
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,320
And I've been, I think I talked about this before.

1418
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,200
The fact that Islands of Adventure hasn't changed is in such stark contrast with a lot

1419
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:30,880
of the theme park theme parks in the country that are change a lot more, especially the

1420
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,600
Disney parks in Florida.

1421
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,760
So it is weird to think about sometimes it is trippy down there sometimes being like,

1422
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:45,960
I was here when I was 13 and then 16 and then 20 and now recently 31.

1423
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,960
It's like it gets, it's a trippy.

1424
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,360
It's just odd to think of.

1425
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,040
Even enough all of as all of our ashes are thrown in tune lagoon.

1426
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,040
Oh, why?

1427
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,920
The trippiest thing of all.

1428
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,920
I mean, I would.

1429
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,800
Every time you go down there, you go, you know what?

1430
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,480
I've gotten older, but tune lagoon stayed the same.

1431
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,480
Like Matthew McConaughey and dazed and confused.

1432
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,560
I have to say the way the ride ends, I always kind of like the line they use at the end.

1433
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,880
Do you remember this?

1434
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,880
No.

1435
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:24,680
The first narrator, the Paul Fries-esque narrator goes like, and it's something along the lines

1436
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,920
of like, and it just goes to show you a Mountie always gets his man, but not always the girl.

1437
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,920
And that's when you see she's kissing the horse.

1438
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,800
And I'm like, oh, I'm always like, oh, that's, that's cute.

1439
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,800
She's kissing the horse though.

1440
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,160
She's giving a little kiss on the cheek.

1441
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,160
Yeah, no, no.

1442
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,760
It's not like in that picture you showed us or anything.

1443
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,280
Yeah, it's not for your porno.

1444
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,760
Same for your porno podcast.

1445
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:50,200
Well, when they need this, wouldn't in our, in our more risque future in 50 years, they're

1446
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,400
going to need to step it up.

1447
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,200
They're going to have to get all these, all these characters fucking.

1448
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,280
Cause tune lagoon will still be standing.

1449
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,280
Certainly.

1450
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,280
50 years.

1451
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,000
Tune lagoon will, God willing outlive us all.

1452
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,040
Tune lagoon will probably outlive some of those comics.

1453
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,960
Like I mean, some of those comic strips do not.

1454
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,960
Yeah, it already has.

1455
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,680
They already have.

1456
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,760
Little Nemo is not still publishing, is it?

1457
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,840
Every now and then there's like tribute.

1458
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,880
There's like tribute anthologies to it.

1459
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,400
Cause it's, it's very influential for a lot of comics artists.

1460
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,920
Have you been asked to collaborate on a little Nemo?

1461
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,880
Yeah, but oddly enough, I slept through the conference call.

1462
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,240
So I should like, look, we're, we're talking so glowingly about it.

1463
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,920
I have some minor complaints about this ride.

1464
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,920
Sure.

1465
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,920
No, nothing's perfect.

1466
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
I know you're going to be upset.

1467
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,920
You're going to be upset about this.

1468
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,920
I'll be fine.

1469
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
I'll live.

1470
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,920
Like it's supposed to be a splash mountain parody, but there's no interior scenes at

1471
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,920
all.

1472
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,440
It's almost all outside and the animatronics are very limited.

1473
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,600
It's like, there's barely any movements.

1474
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,640
There's some dialogue, but anytime like, like on splash mountain, you do, you do a cool

1475
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,320
like drop and all of a sudden you're in like the dark and you're in a forest and there's

1476
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,320
brayer bear and brayer rabbit.

1477
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,520
But like this, you do it on a cool drop and you're in just another piece of the barn.

1478
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,360
You're in a different barn with that's not decorated at all.

1479
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,360
Shrubs kind of.

1480
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:15,080
If I may give them too much credit, there's Jay Ward cartoons had a more limited animation

1481
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,080
style.

1482
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,080
I don't think that's why.

1483
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,480
So I think it's works.

1484
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,440
I think it works for this ride.

1485
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,960
But there should be like a cool elaborate train tracks and the only reference we have

1486
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,880
to train is a Mr. Toad parody where they say something about, Oh, watch out for the train.

1487
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,200
And then like that lights come at you like at the end of Mr. Toad or like Mr. Toad where

1488
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,600
like a train is going to hit you.

1489
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,320
But we don't get a cool big elaborate scene like on splash mountain with smiley whiplash

1490
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,880
and train tracks and a full size train coming at you.

1491
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,040
It just feels parts of this feel cheap.

1492
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,040
It's yeah.

1493
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,640
That's that boat sequence at the end of splash man is like one of the most expensive things

1494
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,640
that ever.

1495
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,800
There's a big riverboat at the end of splash mountain and all these like 50 animatronics

1496
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,320
singing and dancing and things cost money.

1497
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,120
But there's a little trick with the train scene in this in that like you know you think

1498
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,360
you're going through it.

1499
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,000
It's pitch black and then the train light and the train sounds and then you drop.

1500
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,520
There is a drop in the darkness.

1501
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,520
There is a drop in.

1502
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,840
It's not that it's not fun.

1503
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,880
I'm just saying you have to compare this to splash mountain because it's built years after

1504
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,040
splash mountain and it's supposed to be sort of a parody.

1505
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:25,240
But there's just it lacks the depth of fun and characters and show scenes.

1506
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:30,400
So it's like it's a little disappointing in that regard because you never get some wow

1507
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,960
thing like you do on splash.

1508
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,600
Yeah I find it a little chintzy.

1509
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:40,080
I think that is a little my reservation about the ride in general.

1510
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:45,040
With splash mountain though I don't know that we would ever see a big animatronic show scene

1511
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:51,120
like that again because part of that is the fact that they had a warehouse full of animatronic

1512
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,120
animals that they could re-purpose.

1513
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,360
But I think we're going to see that on Star Wars land.

1514
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,880
They're going to build 150 robots and we're going to get to go through it every time and

1515
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,880
it's going to be amazing.

1516
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
I hope so.

1517
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,880
I hope so.

1518
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,680
That's a mega big ticket attraction.

1519
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:12,280
This is just one of the many rides.

1520
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:17,320
Do you guys know about the I barely caught this while researching on the way here.

1521
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,380
Do you guys know about the big finale that was cut from this ride?

1522
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,720
I know.

1523
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:29,960
I only barely caught it on a site called theme park university which has some great stories.

1524
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,440
Shout out to theme park university.

1525
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,000
Indeed they have not only the story but also some concept art.

1526
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,960
What was supposed to happen is that the entire ride was going to be two logs put next to

1527
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:48,160
each other made to look like one log and then when you got up to the final hill Snyder

1528
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:54,120
whiplash is going to lower his big chainsaw into the water splitting the logs in half.

1529
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,120
Isn't that cool?

1530
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,120
Oh man.

1531
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:01,800
You would have split apart and gone into two slightly different flumes.

1532
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,880
So that was kind of the big thing.

1533
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,560
That would have obviously upped the production value and given you something extra fun.

1534
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,800
Isn't that cool?

1535
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,800
And you can see they did drawings of how this was going to work although you still can't

1536
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,720
really imagine how that would work exactly.

1537
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:23,360
Maybe the thing would just dip and then you'd split at the point that the chainsaw is in

1538
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:29,960
the water then you split the two different ways.

1539
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,400
I think that idea would make it a great ride.

1540
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,280
I think the cutting of that makes it a good solid ride.

1541
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:41,720
And to be fair whoever the people who made the ride probably had a hundred cool ideas

1542
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,880
that were cut.

1543
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,560
This is true of so many rides.

1544
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,560
Nobody wants rides to be truncated.

1545
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,240
When I'm saying the things that I don't like I'm not going after the people who made it.

1546
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:53,960
I'm going after those tight ass corporate penny pinchers.

1547
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,360
Yeah especially when you have to open a whole park.

1548
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,120
Like stuff starts to get scaled back and there's a dead there's like we got to open by this

1549
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,120
date.

1550
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
Yeah.

1551
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,120
We got to make this money back.

1552
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,240
Disneyland itself got to evolve so slowly.

1553
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:12,520
Disneyland was probably the revolutionary at the time was probably felt very chintzy

1554
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,160
and still until the 60s until like kind of the major rides started showing up.

1555
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:21,680
So like open a park out of the gate in the 90s that has to immediately compete with with

1556
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,680
Disney.

1557
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,680
Yeah.

1558
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,680
Yeah.

1559
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,680
That is a tall order.

1560
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,440
Although Islands of Adventure God knows did it way better than California Adventure which

1561
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,480
took a very long time to for sure.

1562
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:34,940
Although I did read a funny thing and I remembered this personally.

1563
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:39,120
There was confusion the first year or so of Islands of Adventure because they had done

1564
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,080
a marketing rebrand for the whole resort to call it universal escape.

1565
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,080
Oh yeah.

1566
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,960
And and and didn't do a clear enough job of going.

1567
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:57,120
We have a whole separate park now and two three hotels and city like everyone just thought

1568
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,080
oh Islands of Adventure it's a new land at Universal.

1569
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,080
OK.

1570
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,720
And so then that the marketing changed to go like two parks and you know an entertainment

1571
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,000
really threw it out.

1572
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,520
So also a year and a half after this park open 9 11 happened and really like Orlando

1573
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:21,200
tours like no one was traveling at all like let alone to Florida.

1574
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:27,080
I mean Disney just shut down some of the hotels in Orlando for a while until like attendance

1575
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,560
sort of went back up.

1576
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,440
That was a grim time in theme park world and I think you probably felt the decay in that

1577
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:40,440
can you guys name offhand a lot of good attractions built from like 2002 to 2008.

1578
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,920
It was a pretty dry time.

1579
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,920
Right.

1580
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
Yeah.

1581
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:52,560
I cannot name the worst effect obviously of the Darth of great theme park rides.

1582
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,480
I was going to say the I'm going to praise it for one thing here.

1583
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,480
Wonderful.

1584
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,480
Yeah.

1585
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,440
At the end after you're done you go on this bridge and there are water cannons that if

1586
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:09,920
you pay 25 cents you can spray people spray a stranger that just finished the big drop

1587
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,920
on the ride.

1588
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,840
So they think oh my gosh it's done it's over and you can strategically hit a button and

1589
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,200
hit them in the head with a burst of water.

1590
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,240
Now this might not this sounds cruel this might sound like it's not fun.

1591
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,120
My girlfriend and I this is a couple of years ago we actually didn't do that this time we

1592
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,120
should have.

1593
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,120
I don't know why we didn't.

1594
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:33,280
We went over we put the quarter in and we hit it and the people reacted so like like

1595
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,920
they freaked out so much and then started laughing.

1596
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,720
It was the most satisfying part of the whole ride.

1597
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,560
We both like squealed with the light that we had just done these to the stranger.

1598
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,520
I know this making sounds like we're maniacs but there is something so fun about giving

1599
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,660
like an extra little like scare.

1600
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,760
Now they're getting money out of us.

1601
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,760
I know.

1602
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,760
Yeah.

1603
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,500
To do it but it is a really nice little fun thing at the end of the ride.

1604
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:01,400
That is that is like a universal creative has a term for something like that.

1605
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:08,200
They call it J Pops named after Jay Stein one of the former heads of Universal.

1606
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,880
And it's the idea is that it's a big scare.

1607
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,620
It's a big startling moment.

1608
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:17,920
But you because you're sharing it with people you're with or even strangers you all go.

1609
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:23,120
And then you all laugh like so it's a thing that they that is like a trope in a lot of

1610
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,880
universal rides.

1611
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,120
And I do think it is part of what's fun about this part of the park is that you get it's

1612
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,600
fun to see a stranger.

1613
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,600
Yeah.

1614
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,760
It's fun to see a stranger get all over.

1615
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,760
You laugh at a stranger getting a bucket of water dumped on them and then you get your

1616
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,760
comeuppance immediately because then you get drenched on the rapids ride.

1617
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,760
We got Jay popped and then you all start laughing.

1618
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,760
Shout out to Jay Stein.

1619
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,080
Shout out to Jay Ward.

1620
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,840
So many Jays bringing you the magic over it.

1621
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,880
Dudley Doos rips off falls.

1622
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,880
2017.

1623
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,560
Twenty years after I away 2017.

1624
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:05,920
That was our hip hop celebration of the ride.

1625
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,920
All right.

1626
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,920
Should we wrap?

1627
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,920
Yeah.

1628
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,920
Do we have anything else to add before we give it our skate?

1629
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,320
We figure out where it lands on the scale.

1630
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,960
No, go for it.

1631
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,480
OK, so we have a scale.

1632
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,480
We assess the ride.

1633
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,880
You know, do we want to keep the right absolutely as it is?

1634
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:20,880
Don't change a thing about it.

1635
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,880
We love it.

1636
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,880
Do we want to plus it up?

1637
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,280
Do we want to add stuff to the ride to make it better?

1638
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,600
Or do we want to burn it down for insurance purposes in a mysterious fire?

1639
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,080
So, Jason, would you like to go first?

1640
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,080
Sure.

1641
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,120
I have a guess what you're going to say.

1642
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:43,960
You know, I I I would say after learning about that original ending, I say like, yeah, keep

1643
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,960
the spirit of it.

1644
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,800
But like, yeah, let's let's plus it up.

1645
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,160
Let's let's revamp it.

1646
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,040
We'll soon enough be at Islands of Adventure's 20 year anniversary.

1647
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,960
So I think it'd be cool if some of the stuff that's still there from the opening, they

1648
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:00,640
just like they just hyper like amped them up.

1649
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,480
I think that would be really cool to do.

1650
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,200
And I mean, I thought it was when they when they redid the footage on Spider-Man, like

1651
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:12,400
I thought it really like it's like, oh, this gave this ride like it practically feels like

1652
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
a brand new ride.

1653
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,360
Like all the beats are the same, but it just looks it just looks a lot better and still

1654
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,360
looks pretty good.

1655
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,480
So like, yeah, I think keep this ride pretty similar.

1656
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,800
But like, yes, put some put some new stuff in there, put some new animatronics or non

1657
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,800
structural changing.

1658
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,800
Yeah.

1659
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,800
Yeah.

1660
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,800
Yeah.

1661
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Well, and it still has like a double track.

1662
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,800
They did build it right.

1663
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,240
And they cut right.

1664
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,840
They just run two logs at a time.

1665
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,600
But you could very easily put in the chainsaw at the end.

1666
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,320
I think that would step it up to the next level would make it make it a lot more exciting

1667
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,320
and unique.

1668
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,400
And the only thing is you have to commit to that.

1669
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,920
Like Radiator Springs Racers and California Adventure.

1670
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,480
Like I feel like so often I've been on it where it's like there's a point where the

1671
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:00,080
cars are supposed to get to a starting line of a race and you're supposed to race.

1672
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:06,560
And so often it's just been one car or like one car goes like well before the other cars

1673
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,920
out of the previous seat.

1674
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,680
Rides give up on the racing very easily.

1675
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,960
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:16,160
Look, it would create some operational challenges, but sure, it'd be neat anyway.

1677
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,160
Yeah.

1678
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,840
And you know, spend some of that Harry Potter money, guys.

1679
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,360
Put it back into the community and into Toon Lagoon.

1680
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:30,640
Well, you know, I have my suggestion of how to plus it up.

1681
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,560
It's a link that I can send them from I believe the maker is Nope Porn.

1682
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,400
It's a jiff that lays out perfectly.

1683
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,760
They should do that makes it edgier.

1684
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,240
I'll show it to you guys again.

1685
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,600
You already have the animatronics.

1686
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:50,120
So just and it's very simple animation, almost the level that you guys are that the animatronics

1687
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,120
do already.

1688
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,920
So let's get these characters a little more intimate.

1689
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,880
It makes it makes a little more more edgy for the youth of today.

1690
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,200
How I'll send you the link Islands of Adventure.

1691
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,200
How dare you?

1692
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,160
Jason is offended.

1693
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
I'm choice.

1694
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,000
I guess I'm a little thirsty today.

1695
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,040
What can I say?

1696
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,960
OK, so I also I'm going to say plus it up.

1697
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,160
I have a kind of a radical idea, though, because I think that there's there's too few robots

1698
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,160
on the ride.

1699
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,600
And I think there's not look, they're not going to make this.

1700
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,000
They're not going to tear it down and rebuild it, because that's what I would want.

1701
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,640
I would want something where they totally build some cool scenes with where you're in, like,

1702
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:27,680
feel like you're in the mountains of Canada and you feel like there's an actual giant

1703
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,680
train coming at you.

1704
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,680
But I know that's not going to happen.

1705
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,040
So what can we do?

1706
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,320
We can put more robots on the ride.

1707
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,400
And what robots do I want?

1708
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,520
Not necessarily just the J ward.

1709
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,160
I think we should put all the comic strip robots on this ride.

1710
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,960
All the characters we've seen pictures on the walls.

1711
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,760
I want little Nemo on the ride.

1712
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,800
I want Dagwood and Blondie on the ride.

1713
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,320
I want Nancy and Sluggo waving hello.

1714
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:54,320
And then we can change this from Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls to just call it the Toon Lagoon

1715
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,320
Ripsaw Falls.

1716
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,240
Like, let's keep it simple here and have a very similar narrative.

1717
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,000
Like you can still be sort of snidely whiplash.

1718
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
He's kidnapped.

1719
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,880
Maybe he kidnaps Nancy and Sluggo has to get like he's kidnapping different women, put tying

1720
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,880
them to train tracks.

1721
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,280
Sluggo goes to a pawn shop and buys a gun.

1722
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,280
That's fine.

1723
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,280
I love that.

1724
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,280
That's a great idea too.

1725
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,880
I want you to pack these sides with robots of all these characters.

1726
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,000
Because kids are wondering why can't we ride a ride with Heathcliff on it.

1727
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,080
They see Heathcliff on the wall and they go where's the Heathcliff ride?

1728
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,080
They don't know.

1729
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,880
I want to see him fishing for a...

1730
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,880
Exactly.

1731
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,640
Grabbing a fish bone out of the banks of the Toon Lagoon waters.

1732
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:32,240
So as you're rising up on that on the big drop, you see Heathcliff and he's fishing

1733
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,680
and you're like there he is.

1734
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,240
There's Heathcliff and you're satisfied.

1735
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,160
Because we've teased all these characters and then you don't pay him off.

1736
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:42,000
I want Mary Worth to say a passive aggressive thing to me at the end.

1737
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
That's right.

1738
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That's perfect.

1739
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
That's exactly.

1740
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Now you're thinking.

1741
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
This is what I want.

1742
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,920
I want to pay off the fact that we see all these characters.

1743
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,880
Now we actually get to experience them on a ride.

1744
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,880
So I think that...

1745
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:56,520
I'm one of the PJ family circus PJ running around with a dotted line leaving a dotted

1746
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,520
line trail.

1747
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,840
No, that's where I draw the line.

1748
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,840
PJ is a menace.

1749
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,080
Jason hates PJ.

1750
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,760
His arch rival.

1751
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,760
Grow up kid.

1752
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,760
Learn some respect.

1753
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,720
His ghost grandpa is just like they're stewing.

1754
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:14,480
Like I wish I could still give him a whipping.

1755
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,840
I want Jason on the ride.

1756
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,320
I want a robot of Jason on the ride.

1757
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,440
Eating a sandwich and not liking it.

1758
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,000
I want all of that.

1759
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,200
Like a statue that is a fountain where you're watching the ill effects of the sandwich flowing

1760
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,200
through Jason.

1761
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Yes.

1762
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,200
This is perfect.

1763
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,240
Why are there whole olives on this?

1764
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:40,440
Your famous catchphrase that will ring through the new Ripsaw Falls.

1765
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,440
Not into them.

1766
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,800
Why are there olives on this?

1767
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,800
Why are there olives on this?

1768
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,480
Everyone's got a shirt that says why are there olives on this?

1769
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,480
All right.

1770
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Picture everybody.

1771
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,880
Everybody say why are there olives on this?

1772
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,520
All right.

1773
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,520
Cool.

1774
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,800
We're all plus it up to varying degrees.

1775
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,680
We can maybe combine all three of these.

1776
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,920
We can add the log.

1777
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,720
We can add the horrible sex act.

1778
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,760
We can add all of my characters on it too.

1779
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,840
A fountain of Jason diarrheaing.

1780
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,840
This is a wild ride.

1781
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,480
I love the ride we've invented.

1782
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,600
These are some Ripsaw Falls that are truly rip roaring.

1783
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,680
And on that note, we'll be right back.

1784
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,680
So it's a closed podcast, the ride.

1785
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:28,160
It's kind of a sad note actually that we're going to end on because it was just announced

1786
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:32,040
that Disney is building a big new hotel in Disneyland.

1787
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,200
But the problem is there's limited space at Disney.

1788
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,220
So that real estate comes at a cost.

1789
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:42,400
So there are some businesses that we're going to unfortunately have to say goodbye to.

1790
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:50,480
And we would like to do that now in the most serious way possible.

1791
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,880
So long, Downtown Disney AMC Theater.

1792
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,880
Sure, some people said, why would I waste time in a movie theater when Disneyland is

1793
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,880
mere feet away?

1794
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,720
But those people were haters.

1795
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,640
I, of course, loved you.

1796
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,160
I can't tell you the amount of times I've been at Disneyland riding an exciting classic

1797
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,480
ride and thought, man, this is boring.

1798
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,040
I wish I was sitting in an empty movie theater right now.

1799
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,400
I'd stroll down to your inviting doors and catch a matinee of Vince Vaughn and Kevin

1800
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:19,460
James's wonderful comedy, The Dilemma, or taken an early morning viewing of Johnny Depp's

1801
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:21,040
lizard movie, Rango.

1802
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,680
You know, the nice thing about your theater was how much room there was.

1803
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,320
Never before in a movie theater could I answer the question, if I was using movie seats to

1804
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:33,520
measure the length of my body, how many movie seats long would I be?

1805
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,280
The answer might surprise you.

1806
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,280
Six.

1807
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,860
I am six movie seats long.

1808
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,880
So goodbye, Downtown Disney AMC Theater.

1809
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,480
I will truly miss you.

1810
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,520
Oh, and also I used to get free parking at Downtown Disney by buying a movie ticket electronically,

1811
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,080
going inside to get my parking validated and then using the Fandango app to cancel the

1812
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,080
ticket.

1813
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,480
A pretty sweet hack.

1814
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,820
Anyway, so long.

1815
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:02,960
By the way, lovely of you to score that with such a lush lullaby version of Every Breath

1816
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,960
You Take.

1817
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:12,120
I believe I believe we've all prepared versions of respectful funereal songs.

1818
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:17,320
And Jason, I look forward to yours.

1819
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,800
Sure.

1820
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,840
What is there to say about the Rainforest Cafe?

1821
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,800
You know, my family always enjoyed the Rainforest Cafe, the animatronic animals, the fun, the

1822
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,800
fun sound effects, the super powerful air conditioner at the Orlando location.

1823
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:37,440
And most importantly, everyone could agree that it was pretty good.

1824
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:43,400
I remember ordering fun fruity drinks as a kid and fun appetizers, but I have no memory

1825
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,600
of entrees, which is probably not a great sign of eating a restaurant that I've eaten

1826
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,840
at that much.

1827
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:56,160
On a personal note, the Anaheim location is notable for being the first place I had a

1828
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,840
beer with my father after I turned 21.

1829
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:08,400
It was mid-October at night and about 50 degrees and they opted to seat us on the balcony.

1830
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,260
I believe one of the locations was also the first place I had coconut curry, a food I'm

1831
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,440
now very fond of.

1832
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:20,640
Is this really a eulogy or am I just naming food and beverage memories I have?

1833
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,640
Who cares?

1834
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,920
Anyway, I do think Rainforest Cafes are fun.

1835
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,840
Sadly, the Walt Disney Company is better at making hotels than the Landry Restaurant Group

1836
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,320
is at making restaurants.

1837
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,560
So it's time to go.

1838
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:40,120
But if you're fond of the Rainforest Cafes, please visit any one of their 26 other worldwide

1839
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,120
locations.

1840
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,120
Beautiful.

1841
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,120
So beautiful.

1842
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,360
All right.

1843
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:54,280
And from your piano, Wiz Khalifa, to my piano, Sarah McLaughlin, a great zone once said, get

1844
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,960
in the zone at this temple of all things ESPN.

1845
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:06,480
But now this truly fine temple, the ESPN zone, is due to be de-erected, the 120 HDTVs unplugged,

1846
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,480
including the ones in the bathroom.

1847
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,600
And so, ESPN zone, I reflect on my memories of you.

1848
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,120
Truly a zone for all seasons.

1849
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,880
I remember when I first stepped inside your walls, which of course are covered in creepy

1850
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,080
bobbing athlete heads.

1851
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,480
It was 2002.

1852
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,920
I had just finished touring nearby Chapman University, where I was considering enrolling.

1853
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:31,400
My meal at you helped me decide that going to college in Anaheim would probably be very

1854
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,400
boring.

1855
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,320
Thank you, zone, for shaping my academic career.

1856
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:41,560
I visited you again 15 years later, purely for parking validation reasons.

1857
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,760
We learned that alcohol doesn't actually count towards validation, so we had to buy one of

1858
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,760
your desserts, an off-brand Pizookie that we deemed acceptable.

1859
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:56,040
Today I cherish these two memories that we shared, and I honor them by pouring one out.

1860
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:01,080
Specifically, your signature drink, the Espie, the world's finest beverage made of peach

1861
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:05,200
schnapps and Sprite, to zone with love.

1862
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,200
Beautiful.

1863
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,200
Beautiful.

1864
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,200
Are you guys okay?

1865
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,480
Are we going to be able to get it together in the episode?

1866
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,640
Okay, I think so.

1867
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,680
But there's word, though, that these might be relocated.

1868
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,680
Yeah.

1869
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,880
We're just going to put shops underneath the restaurant.

1870
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,880
There's a chance.

1871
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,880
Dry your eyes.

1872
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,880
There might be.

1873
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:24,880
I forgot one thing.

1874
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,920
I also validated parking at the Rehmer's, Kev.

1875
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,040
A strong reason for the mall to exist.

1876
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,200
The hat trick of parking validation.

1877
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,880
None of us had anything to say about the Earl of Sandwich.

1878
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,880
No.

1879
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,880
Fuck you, Earl of Sandwich.

1880
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,880
Yeah, go to hell, Earl.

1881
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:43,960
Where you already are, the actual Earl of Sandwich.

1882
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,520
Well I hope you enjoyed us talking about one of the most popular rides ever, Dudley Do-Right

1883
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,520
Ripsaw Falls.

1884
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,200
A trip to Dubai, a trip to Toon Lagoon, a trip to the 30s, and a trip to hell with Earl of

1885
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,200
Sandwich.
