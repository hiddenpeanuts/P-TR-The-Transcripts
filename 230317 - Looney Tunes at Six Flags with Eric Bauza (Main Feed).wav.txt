 Forever.
  Dog.
  Warning.
  The following podcast may trigger  severe dork-outs.
  Thanks to the guest's incredible  voices and equally incredible  vintage shirts.
 Be on the lookout  for rapping rabbits, sun-bleached  rides, and a heavy  dose of Toronto nostalgia.
  It's the Looney Tunes at Six Flags  with Looney Tunes voice  Eric Bowser on Podcast  The Ride.
  Welcome to Podcast The Ride  hosted by three very good boys  who are deeply uncomfortable with the  phrase, Puddy Tat.
  I'm a racking frack environment  by the name of Scott Gardner  joined by my co-host, what a  maroon.
 It's Mike Carlson.
  That's true, that is what I am.
  But I'm still reeling from what you said earlier.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  When I said earlier, I mean 15 seconds ago.
  That was earlier than right now, yes.
  We'll try to avoid  disgusting, lewd phrases such as  that.
 And host  number three, Aini the Stinker.
  It's Jason Sheridan.
  I've been sitting over here with beta breath  to see what I was given tonight.
  I mean, that's, you've  said the phrase before even,  not even in the context of  the Looney Tunes.
 Oh, yeah.
  You are the stinker of the show.
  Today we are talking about  all things  Looney Tunes, including their  Six Flags association, Bugs Bunny  World at Magic Mountain.
  And we're doing it because we're joined by  an excellent guest who  he voices some  of the more obscure characters  in the Looney Tunes canon.
  Just some of the, you know, the more S.
O.
J.
, the deeper cuts  such as Bugs Bunny,  Daffy Duck, Porky  Pig, Elmer Fudd, Marvin  the Martian, Foghorn Leghorn, too many  to name.
 It's the Emmy winning  Eric Bowser.
 Hello.
  Oh, forget about him.
 Do me, do me.
  Daffy, it's me.
 Do me next.
  What about, am I a loser?  And am I, what am I to you, Scott?  Lists are arbitrary.
  I didn't mean to put you in any particular  order.
 We could do it again and you could be number one, Daffy.
  Oh, I see, I see.
 Not good enough  for an insult from you.
 I get it.
  Not on your radar, I see.
  I didn't want to insult you.
  I thought you seem a little touchy.
  I don't know.
 I'll just go.
  Come on, Daffy.
 Come on now.
  Relax.
 Everyone's friends  here.
 I was  going to start off with like  you can do as much or as little  voices as you'd like to do.
  You can steer the ship.
 I am just  a whore when it comes to  these characters.
 No, I  am just thankful to be here.
 Thank you, guys.
  Thank you for doing it.
  Again, these characters for me are  who I grew up watching  and from anyone that's  read an interview or seen another  interview, you know, you'll know  that this was the Bible for me Saturday  mornings.
 It was reruns.
  And I guess it was the 80s,  more particularly the 90s,  where these characters had somewhat  of a like a renaissance, I guess,  because they were originally made in the  40s, 50s.
 And  you know, decades later  here they are in the 90s being  you know, slathered over  air fresheners, mud flaps,  you know, for 18  wheeler trucks.
 Coca-Cola  cans promoting Six Flags.
  Is that the right brand? I think it was  Coke, right? Yeah.
  And that ties in my appearance here  today is my obsession with the Looney  Toons, not just as cartoon characters, but  as backdrops to  the Six Flags Magic Mountains  theme park.
 Right on.
 You voice these  characters who are like  the corporate  faces of  you know, various parks  and not just to jump around  a little bit because we're sort of  Looney Tunes focused.
 I don't want to shut off  another character because  you're the voice of  the face of Six Flags,  but also a character we've talked about  a lot over the years who  is by default Universal's  Mickey and that is Woody  Woodpecker.
 That's right.
  And it doesn't get you into  Super Nintendo World any faster  than any other.
 No.
  You gotta watch the Virtual Q when you get  there.
 Hi, I'm  the voice of Woody Woodpecker.
 Yeah, yeah, sure pal.
  Just, uh, you have a platinum  pass or not? I do and  you can go.
 I was there last night.
 The red  pass, that's what I have, the red feathers  of Woody.
 But here's the thing I've learned, you can  only, the only way to  skip to the front of the line  for Bowser's Castle Mario  Kart, the ride, is to have a  VIP pass, which is  $400 per pass.
  But that includes a free lunch,  a tour, a guided tour.
  Oh, that's what gets you the like, you're on  the back line, you're going in the sets and everything.
  You're not just on the big tram.
 But if you're just  there, like that, that is the  only way, unless you get there right before the park  opens and you're lined up to go into  Mario land or whatever it is.
  Right, right.
 Yeah, that's the only,  that's the hack.
 You have to pay $400.
  Money is always the  hack.
 Let me tell  you something about money and theme parks.
  It's what  makes those things run.
  Not electricity, but  just paper money.
  You've been a  universal fan, a theme parks fan  it seems like forever.
 Part of me asking  you if you wanted to do this was  your Instagram, which is a treasure trove  of memories of yours.
  It's constantly you seemingly  proving your voice  nerd credentials,  I feel like.
  You were completely the kid  who loves this stuff and now you get to do  it and how cool is that?  Again, going back to  the night, I ran  into our colleague, Kyle  Mooney at Six Flags Magic Mountain,  who we both worked with on Smash  Saturday morning.
 Saturday morning All Star Hits,  which you were so great on.
 Some of our favorite voices  in the whole thing.
 Thank you.
  We were there because of the premiere  of, to celebrate  the premiere of Space Jam  A New Legacy, which I was lucky enough to do  one or five  voices, I don't know how many voices I did on it, but  even if I was like the out of focus  tree in the background, I would have  been happy.
 There were a lot of out of  focus characters in the movie.
 Maybe no movie  ever had more out of focus characters.
  HBO Max, the movie.
  With LeBron, maybe.
  But yeah, we were there to celebrate that  movie and  it was kind of funny because on the red carpet,  if you were just kind of like walking in,  there was a mascot of  Daffy, but specifically  for me Sylvester.
 And I remember  when I first  visited Los Angeles and  first went to Six Flags,  there's photos of me and I  actually compare, I put them together  now, where it's me from like  1994 and  Sylvester in Six Flags  in 1994.
 And then  what, that was like two years ago  or 2020, like in the  thick of the pandemic.
 It was actually  a big thing that we were even able to go  to Six Flags to do this because  it was that one week in LA  where there wasn't COVID, if you  remember.
 They're like, hey, it's gone.
 Let's  go out and lick fire hydrants  and stuff.
 And then  Cut the Six Flags padlock.
 Yeah, and  then literally after that movie premiered,  lockdown again.
 But  I remember being on that  red carpet wanting to take that photo knowing  that that photo existed in  1994 at that exact same  theme park.
 Wow, wow.
 So I  had put them to, I put them like  side by side so you could see  how little I've grown  since then.
 I'm still like  a tiny person.
  But a tiny nerd.
  To that end,  do we have that picture, Jason?  I think you loaded up a photo.
 I loaded up  a photo.
  Eric, I got this on your.
.
.
 Blackmail photo, right?  This is the.
.
.
 Yeah, yeah.
 We will show this  to all of our viewers.
 This is available  on ForeverDog on the YouTube  also.
 Well, Eric, you might be ahead of  me because I see you brought a shirt.
  But I emailed.
.
.
 Oh, this  might be the exact shirt that we  may or may not see any minute.
  If not now, we could see it later,  I'm sure.
 If we did.
.
.
  This is, I think, a picture of you  in.
.
.
 You were in eighth  grade.
 Do I have that right?  If the braces are correct  and the laser background  is correct, that was the.
.
.
 Yeah, the laser background  really gives away a range of  dates.
 That was the era.
  Not to date yourself, but never post  a photo of you with lasers in the background.
  Because it looks like  I was like a jewel thief.
  Like I was in a heist.
  You were in the middle.
 I was in mid-heist.
  Oh, there it is.
 Look at this.
 Just that  weird Widow's Peak that I have  there.
 Oh, there it is.
 Oh, God!  The further down you go, the  worse it gets.
 Keep going.
 We've seen the braces.
  Scroll down.
 This is like it's loading  on Windows in 1985.
 Yeah, I  feel like I'm trying to download  pornography in the 90s.
  We're just trying to get to a kid's shirt  though.
 We're not trying to do something weird.
  We're not trying to do anything weird.
 We're just trying to see  an eighth graders full shirt.
  If you want to scroll down a few more  pixels, maybe  we'll get to the juice of the photo.
  Or is this all.
.
.
 There it is!  Good God!  Listeners, this is a very  early  90s kind of like purple  pastel pattern  that's extremely busy in very  90s fashion.
 And the pattern  is primarily made up of  Bugs Bunny.
 It's like a Wild Berry Pop  Tart of a shirt.
  It's such a good.
.
.
 It's like the most  attractive color scheme to me because we're all  growing up.
.
.
 We all grew up the same.
  This is it.
 That was essentially  what was fashionable back in the 90s.
  And this was to  me.
 Like, I saw this  hanging in the, you know,  the gift shops of Six Flags  in the children's area because that's the only  place in Six Flags where the Looney Tunes  exist.
 And I was like,  oh my God, I'm  going to get married and buried in this shirt.
  I was in the eighth grade and I knew  that already.
 And I actually  brought it with me.
  This is it.
 So this is the  shirt  that predicted my future.
  This is the exact  same shirt.
 And for whatever reason,  this is the funny, disgusting part about it,  there's a giant hole in the back  where my ass might be.
  Like I blew out a fart and  ruined the garment.
  And if this isn't  going to make the podcast  even weirder, I'm going to try it  on to see if it.
.
.
  I'm so glad we have the video  component.
 Before I pass it around so you  can all get a sniff.
  Because that's what I was hoping that you would do.
  Like how you're holding it now.
  It feels like a holy  garment of some kind.
  Whoever wears it is bestowed with voice powers.
  I commend you for holding  onto it because that would go for hundreds on  Deepop.
 This is actually the  original plot of Big.
 But they're  like, it's too weird that he wants to be the voice of  Bugs Bunny when he's older.
 What if he just wants  to be Big? And  forget about the Looney Tunes element.
  This is what I had pitched.
 New Line Cinema.
  What is this?  This is Looney Tunes exclusively  for Six Flags is what the  label says.
 Can't find that on.
.
.
  Well, not the internet at the time.
 You can't find that in  the Warner Bros.
 Studio store.
 And it says  Looney Tunes characters, names, and  all related indica.
  Indica.
 Isn't that.
.
.
  Sounds like a wheat strain.
  Indica and Sativa are  trademarks of Warner Bros.
 1991.
  Uh, yeah,  so.
.
.
 Oh, crazy hearing Bugs  say the strains.
  Is he allowed? Is that okay?  I said, you got any foghorn, Kuch?  That's what I want to know, son.
  Okay, here.
  I'm gonna try the sun.
  This is history.
  Am I wrong? Does anyone else get nervous  when Bugs starts talking? And like in a way where  one of the most famous people on Earth  is talking to you? Or am I the only one?  Oh, yeah.
 Oh, a thousand percent.
  It's a little strange.
 No, it's not.
  It's great.
 I'm like, oh my gosh, Bugs  is in the room.
 Yeah.
 There's something  otherworldly about it.
 Right.
 It takes me to  a different place.
 And this  is a pretty successful transfer on Eric's  part so far.
 This looks great.
  I built a time machine.
  I'm sure one of these buttons  is gonna pop.
 I'm gonna leave  the gut part of the shirt.
  This is future-proofing from clothing  manufacturers in the 90s by making  all things very baggy.
  Yeah.
 Okay, big reveal.
  You're gonna want this again in 30 years.
  Oh my god.
 It's.
.
.
  It's great.
 It still fits, guys.
  If I could recreate the  pose, the pose.
  Can we key out the red of the curtain and give you  some lasers? We'll work on the post on this.
  Yeah.
 Wow.
 So either  I was a really big eighth grader  or I'm a very small man.
 It's  either which.
.
.
 I'll just stop it  now because all the dates I had lined  up this Friday on Tinder are gone.
  Well, I wanted to commend you because  that is something that I  would buy  when I was that young out of Six Flags.
  I would not have had the gumption  to wear it both to school and  on picture day.
 So people thought  and they still say it, like, why  are you wearing a pajama top to picture day?  They're like, what is your.
.
.
 you're an idiot.
  And I'm like, you'll  all see.
 Wait till we all  live this through this thing called COVID-19  and then  and only then after I will be the voice  of Bugs Bunny in the year  2020, I think.
  It's a good thing you have that shirt and not like  a tougher-to-get  voice.
 I don't know who else  in Warner Brothers.
  I mean, you were in the Looney Tunes,  but like, you know, unless  if you went to Universal and bought the same  pattern but Frankensteins,  then you're just  dependent on are they doing anything with the  property? Is the dark universe up and running?  Then my dream would be to be the guy  in the Frankenstein outfit.
  And again, it would be a very  unimpressive photo of Frankenstein  at 5'5".
 Even with  those big phone book shoes, no one would  be threatened.
 The least intimidating  Frankenstein.
 I want  a picture with Marilyn.
 Marilyn Monroe.
  That's a picture.
 Is that  the sound of short Frankenstein?  He's like literally  half the  angst of big Frankenstein.
  Sounds right to me.
  But yeah, going back to  Six Flags,  again, and being a kid  on vacation where your parents  give you, here's like a little bit of vacation.
  Here's your budget.
 Now don't  go crazy.
 Don't, you know, buy  food.
 Buy the things you need to survive  while you're away for a couple weeks.
  And of course, I was under the care of my aunt and uncle.
  But I blew it all on Looney  Tunes stuff.
 I bought an  all brown Wile E.
 Coyote  shirt where it was the color  of his fur and only his  muzzle, eyes, and ears.
  It was so 90s.
 Like, it was like  god, they were so good.
 Actually, you know what I should  have done, and I'm  an idiot, maybe on part two  of this, I bought every  Warner Brothers catalog off  eBay.
 I don't think you can search  for it because I'm, again,  obsessed.
 I'm obsessed.
  You can't find a  90s Warner Brothers catalog on  eBay right now.
 It's because they're all at my house.
  I bought.
 Really? Wow.
 And they  were released by season.
 So I,  you know, there goes my son's college fund.
  At least the first few weeks  of his university career gone  because I just had to have  that Rover Dangerfield cover  of Rodney Dangerfield and his dog  self.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 I'll  scan that and send it for your  fans.
 Please send whatever for the socials.
  He understands.
 These are  priceless items.
 Where did this  catalog, because there was the studio store  which I was really fond of in the malls,  but the catalog was a whole other  So it was like the size  of like, you know, it was  very thin.
 It was  seasonal.
 So it was only like, you know, spring,  summer, winter.
 Of course, they had Christmas  and holiday stuff.
  But like it was just for the studio  store.
 And there are pictures  of like celebrities that were  hot back then.
 So I  actually have, because it's Warner Brothers  100th this year,  I have been scanning pages of that  in, of the catalog and like erasing  all like the writing.
  So I, if you check on my, on my  Instagram, there's a picture of  Mark Lynn Baker,  Bronson Pinchot, and the girl that played  Mary Ann on Perfect Strangers.
  And they're all wearing Daffy Duck or  Looney Tunes stuff.
 And they're all like  like, hey! Like cause they're  popular.
 They're so, who else?  Gene Shallot was  featured heavily.
  Now you've got our attention.
  It's like him and Tweedy and Sylvester  eating cake.
 And like, cause I think  at that point they were celebrating their 50th.
  And then there's one of Jonathan,  there's lots of Jonathan Winters.
  Like just like in different attire.
  Like Warner Brothers ball caps  and stuff.
 But they would get, and  of course Fris Freeling, Chuck Jones,  these are beloved directors of the  Warner Brothers, you know, history  and legend.
 They're still alive.
  Mel Blanc also was featured in the catalog  like posing with bugs, like a cartoon  drawing of bugs.
 Oh wow.
  There's so much good stuff in there.
 Oh, there's  an entire catalog just about Gremlins  too.
 So if you're a huge  fan of that movie, I'm like  truly, and there's stuff in there  that you'll just, you'll never be able to get.
 And my  goal is to try to recreate  like, cause I work with intellectual  property like the licensing  of Warners.
 I'm trying to milk  this for as much as possible.
  You have a brand also  Yeah, Retro Kid  in Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.
 And we deal a lot with  Canadian nostalgia like Degrassi.
  Stuff that made it here, hoping  you know, some Americans will latch on to it.
  But otherwise it's just a collection of  really obscure Canadian children's programming  where you're just like, what the hell  were they doing in Canada? Like  why does this exist? It's so weird.
  When I was reading about  your work, I definitely had some long detours  learning about Mr.
 Dress Up.
  Yes.
 And  also looking at your store's expansive  website.
 Yeah, thank you.
  And oddly enough, like, Mr.
 Dress Up  was like our Mr.
 Rogers.
  And actually they were friends at one  point in their history.
  But he was basically like our  you know, our childhood  for whatever reason, there was  always a guy who lived by himself  that would talk to you and  would have friends who were, who happened to just be  puppets, that also kind of live at  this weird house that is in his house.
  It's like a place where they could be creative  and then like leave.
 Like, Kiwi's Playhouse  was kind of like that.
 Oh, that's true.
  We go visit a place.
  We leave our creativity here  at the single man's house.
 This is where  we go smoke weed is basically  there was another guy in Canada  like another show called Fred  Penner's Place.
 Oh, we had that.
  They put that on Nickelodeon too.
 Okay, yeah.
  So you would follow this guy through a tree trunk  into this secret part of the  forest and he would sing to you  and then he'd be like, oh, we need  to go now.
  Like, yeah, it's too bad.
  Don't tell your parents.
 Yeah.
  Don't tell them you went in the tree trunk.
  Yeah.
 So much stranger danger  but then also every show was go  visit a, like  this weird guy's house.
  Yeah, it was come over, hang out  for 22 minutes, we'll make stuff and  I'll put some clothes on and pretend  to be someone else.
 Everything's  gonna be fine.
 Everything's gonna be fine.
  Yeah.
 Yeah, kids, do that on PBS.
  Do not do it two blocks away.
  Absolutely.
 Do not  look stranger in the eye.
 Do not go to Mr.
  Smith's.
 Stay the hell away.
  Stay out of Mr.
 Smith's tree trunk.
 Maybe  there's a new thing we just created.
  It's like a host that  operates inside an abandoned amusement park  and he's like, come ride, come ride  rides with me.
 Sure.
 I have the  keys still.
 Yeah.
 Hey, climb  the fence.
 I got a hole  in the fence just for you.
  Go flip some switches.
 Let's see if any of this  electricity turns on.
 You don't need  seat belts.
 Put your mouth under this fountain  soda machine.
  It never goes bad.
  Never.
 Oh no, a rat flew  out.
 Oh well.
  The puppet friends are like, yeah, raccoons  and rats and  maybe a homeless guy could be  the sidekick.
 I don't know.
 This sounds good.
  The security guard.
 The security guard.
  He'd be the nemesis of the city.
  The security guard who's seen some shit.
  He doesn't use that word, but we know he has.
  This is good.
  We need to like, abandoned amusement parks  have gotten a bad rap from the Scoop Scoop franchise  and it's time to learn they can be  joyous places.
 Sure, yeah.
 We can't let  good time, the second act of good time  be our.
 Oh yeah, right.
 Yeah, yeah.
  You're not necessarily going to get drugged and  left for dead.
 No.
 Yeah, yeah.
  Things might turn out great.
 There's no  a lesson doesn't need to be learned every episode.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Just pure fun.
 You know?  I think  something else to ask you about too, in terms of that  Instagram stuff.
 I also love seeing you at the  I forgot this place existed.
 The building's  still there, but this might have been on your like  LA sojourns also  that you were, you took  pictures at what was then the Hanna-Barbera  headquarters,  which is now like, I think people  live there.
 It's an apartment complex.
  Condos and a gym.
 Wow.
  We have the LA fitness there.
 It's all  like a complex just below the  Universal City Hill.
 Yeah.
 And I totally  actually until I saw your Instagram I forgot  that'd be part of the kind of the tour that  my dad would take me on is like, not  just Universal, but they make all the  they make the Flintstones and stuff here too.
 What  a magical.
 Did you guys ever get to see that building  while it was still around? Not in its state, no.
  I just thought it was an interesting  building architecturally for a long time.
  And then a few years ago I saw like  a photo of the guard stand  with like someone in a yogi walk around  costume in it.
 Yeah.
  There are still hints and remnants  of Hanna-Barbera in that complex,  in that area.
 Like paintings of  like dinosaur footprints on the ground.
  I think there might be some murals on the wall that  they are still going to keep up in memory of Hanna-Barbera.
  But I remember  being a kid  growing up in Toronto watching  Two Stupid Dogs, Powerpuff Girls,  Dexter's Lab,  Johnny Bravo.
 At the end of every  episode in those 90s Hanna-Barbera  before they became Cartoon Network  there would be a voice going,  send all your fan mail to  26555 Coinga Boulevard.
  And I was like Coinga Boulevard.
  That's a weird name.
  I remember, I felt so bad  for my uncle who is no longer with us, but  he never had kids and every time  I visited I was always like,  take me here now!  I need to see this place  now! To Coinga!  The most magical place in the city.
  You're probably in your mid  40s, almost 50, and this  stupid kid comes from Canada  and he's like demanding you  take me to these places.
  And sure enough he did.
 He was also  the uncle too by the way that would  send me clips and clippings  of LA Times  newspaper, the entertainment section  like Little Mermaid breaks box office  you know, Dolly.
  He was the one that encouraged me to be in animation.
  So that's what  he gets.
 He gets a kid that's  obsessed.
 So he in fact did drive  me to Hanna-Barbera.
 It was the weekend so it was  closed.
 I did take pictures  outside of this building  and yeah now it's a gym.
  It's kind of sad but  at the same time  I've managed  to  work and make friends with people  that were inside of that building.
  People that could tell me  stories about hearing  people like  Mel Blanc or Don  Messick who was the original voice of Scooby.
  The walls were paper  thin.
 Like if someone was getting in trouble you could  hear someone arguing like  four offices away  and just weird stuff.
  And you know I'm talking about  Frank Welker who's still a  living legend still with us.
 He  is literally half of IMDB if you look  him up.
 He was like all the gremlins  you know.
  Megatron.
 Yeah he's done so many  voices and everything but  now he is Scooby-Doo and  is still Freddie Jones from  that.
 He still does it.
  We got him on Smash.
  It was unbelievable.
 You did?  Yeah yeah.
 Just through like it didn't even get to see  him.
 It was like I don't think we even had the zoom  window.
 It was like a scratchy bad  connection.
 Which then you're like are  we going to be able to understand this and then that voice  comes booming through like I think  we'll be fine.
 That's so great.
 I'm glad  that he was it just makes it that  much more authentic that you got Frank in  there.
 That was the thought was like  yeah we're doing this full 80s  90s tribute what better way to make it  authentic than getting like you know  like the people from then  like because those vocal qualities you recognize  instantly.
 But yourself included  because we thought of you right away because you  are the new version of that  you know.
 Thanks Doc.
 I bet  you say that to all your guests who voice  bugs bunny.
  This is so sad.
 I'm doing the voice  that I'm wearing this shirt.
  No it's not.
 It's  we're blown away.
 This is like  I like this will be the nerdiest episode  on our.
 I want to say like  I want to say thank you bugs so much  for all you've done.
 Like I think  that's the core of I think all of us.
 You're  welcome.
 You're doing just fine.
  You got your own show.
 There's lights  in the stage and a couch.
  Thank you bugs.
 Amazing.
 That's all  I ever wanted.
 The most encouraging note  we've got in years.
  Can I ask a question.
 Do you do the Wiley  like intelligent Wiley?  Yes Wiley  coyote.
 Super genius.
  Yeah.
  I've only ever done it like maybe  like once or twice.
  Maybe for a  like an app video  game on your phone.
 Oh wow.
 It was literally  like here's five things that he said.
  Just say them.
  But yeah Mel Blanks like normal  normal voice print is very  difficult to kind of  get because he had a very  rich you know  smoked at 9 a.
m.
  butted out at 9 p.
m.
  probably unfiltered.
  We did have to ask you to put out your unfiltered  Chester Fields when we started  recording.
 When you saw me I was like  sucking on a rain drizzled cigarette  outside.
 Is it time to go in?  Oh man he's  got to build my voice up.
  If I don't smoke these  I just sound like a woman.
 Yeah I sound  like my mom.
  You powered through a couple of packs that we  started.
 Yeah.
  In terms of that Mel Blank stuff  you must just know beyond that  you do so many of his voices  you must just like understand  the general ecosystem  of him  pretty well.
 That you know his regular  what's closest to his regular voice and what's  furthest.
 I kind of call it  the house of Mel Blank.
 And it's  like some characters  live in the attic so if I'm doing  Tweety it's almost  almost the same voice as  Bugs but Bugs is like maybe  like a step down here.
  So Tweety I'll do a self  pitch.
 Like it's up here and you kind  of have to talk like a baby.
  So all the L's and W's  and all that stuff.
 Like you can't say  Granny.
 He always says  Dwanney.
 With a D.
  Dwanney that putty cat's  trying to chase me.
 And then they'll  pitch that up.
 And then  Bugs I kind of ask them  or maybe suggest maybe not  to pitch that up at all.
  Because there's again something  so weird almost like Jack Mercer  doing Popeye.
 Where it's like  you know you who olive oil I bring  you some flowers.
 And you who olive  oil I bring you some flowers.
 It's like  it's this high pitch and kind of  low voice mixed together.
  And I always think that's kind of like Bugs.
  It's almost like this  kind of higher pitched nasally  Brooklyn Bronx accent  thing that he does.
  But you can still hear that grit to  his voice.
 Now Sylvester  and Daffy are the same voice.
  By the way I'll never use this mic again.
  This is like I'm probably going to have to buy this mic.
  So Sylvester's like  here right.
 He's that big sloppy  cat that's trying to eat that  bird.
 I'm going to eat that  yellow canary if it's the last  thing I do.
  That would have got to me so much more than I thought it would.
  I'm excited about all of these but  I didn't think that was going to hit me so hard.
  But Sylvester  is the same voice that he did for  Daffy.
 But they would take this  and speed it up.
  They'd pitch it up.
 And when  I do Daffy I'm doing what we remember.
  Daffy is how he sounds.
  Which to me is Richard  Dreyfus with a lisp.
 That's all it is.
  Mayor Vaughn  what we're dealing with here is  a perfect eating machine.
  All he  wants to do is eat people and  make little baby sharks.
  Yeah like that's what I whenever I hear Daffy  I think about like Richard Dreyfus.
 Geez.
  I never would have made that connection.
 That's insane.
  And then Pepe Lepieux  I say he is in the basement for  other reasons as well.
 He is a  pervert and we keep  him zel.
 Stays down there chirp.
 But  he is in the same rate I say  as Vaughn Leghorn.
 So if you  take that same bassy type  boys and do French  and then do Southern.
 It's  in the same.
 Pay attention  Scott.
 I'm talking here.
  Anyways  that's kind of like the  Ferris wheel of  characters I guess.
 Do you  visualize that too? Are you  sort of like spatially  to go to those places? Yeah.
  And also when we record I'm not doing  the back and forth between characters.
  I'm kind of like  when we do Bugs Bunny Builders I'll do Tweety  first then I'll do Daffy and then I'll  to separate Tweety from  Bugs I'll do Daffy in the middle.
  Oh wow.
 So I'm like  reading the script like three times  essentially.
 When you were a kid  were you like doing it analytically or  did you just do it pretty well and then as you got older  you got the extra.
  I think it's the same answer for every kid  growing up.
 It just sounds like a kid doing it  right? It sounds like worried parents  going what's wrong with him?  I think he hit his head sometime during  recess yesterday.
  Yeah for me it was Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
  That was the movie that I  thought was real.
 I thought like  oh man if I go to Hollywood Bugs Bunny  will be walking down the street.
  On Kohanga he's always there.
  He loves it.
 That's a lot  more charming than like say Mike  and I going like I am scared of the dip.
  I can never meet this judge.
  That's true.
 We were worried about the judge.
  It was real hard.
  Christopher Lloyd was the.
.
.
I'm still terrified  of Christopher Lloyd because I'm afraid  his eyes will turn into daggers.
 Cartoon  daggers.
  But yeah I mean  I think as a kid you run around the  house thinking you.
.
.
  I nailed it.
 I nailed this voice and it just  sounds like a kid doing it.
 But it wasn't  until high school when they were like  okay we get it.
  You can do voices.
  Stop.
  Please stop.
  And then they'd be like well why don't we  let them just get it all out  and do the morning announcements.
  They let me go on the PA system.
  I could have said anything.
 I could have done  awful things.
 But I took  that as a way  of creative outlet and the  teachers were so nice.
  Yeah Cardinal  Newman High School is where I went.
  It's at this place in Scarborough  where I grew up which is where they filmed  The Love Guru.
 Mike Meyers  hits The Love Guru.
  Very recently talked about on this show.
  Really?  Well that  whole scene at the end where they're dancing  they're doing the whole Bollywood number.
 It was  done in Scarborough.
  If you just look up my high school  was right there where they were  dancing.
 Now I'm really impressed.
  Now I'm telling you.
 I live  like one block over  from Mike Meyers way which is  actually just a.
.
.
 because they named a street  after him.
 I'm from Scarborough.
  Jim Carrey was from Scarborough.
  Worked and lived in Scarborough.
  John Candy went to high school  at Neil McNeil's.
 It's like an all boys high school.
  Yeah there's  something weird about Scarborough.
  People  with the ability to morph into weird  characters I guess.
  Is there like a  mundanity to it that  makes a spark of like I  have to go crazy.
 Probably.
  I was going to say  what keeps us humble are those  disgusting winters.
 I heard  last week in Toronto there was a day  where it was like  they got like 70 degree  weather or whatever and then literally  the following day was just like  four feet of snow.
  Not so  fast there guys.
 You still got a few more  months of this shit.
 You ever have to fight  back the Canadian in the void? Do you ever  like find some Canadian in  Daffy El Cervester? As soon as I  go back even for five minutes it's like Rick  Moranis and then you come back and you're like oh  hey like it's Louis Tully from  Who Does Your Tax? It's like I'll come  back here and it'll just be  like ugh.
 It's  embarrassing but it's also like  you know I always say I recharge  my Canadian comedy batteries when  I go back.
 That's why  you should.
  Well so okay.
  To dovetail it back into theme park  stuff a little bit.
 Oh oh here's a thing  before we talk a little bit of Six Flags  because this was a question I had  just when we were DMing.
  I wondered  you must have done voices in attractions  somewhere.
  I couldn't tell you where but well I found one  but you tell me.
  Okay so it is crazy that  now we live in this age  and era of you know  hey celebrities get busy.
 They  get too busy or  you know they've been known to  ask for lots of money and  as they should they've  created such amazing characters.
  Believe it or not  I'm the voice match for Antonio  Banderas for Puss in Boots  for DreamWorks.
 Oh  wow wow.
 So all  you have to do is close your eyes  and listen to this voice.
  And that is what I do for Puss in Boots.
  Yeah it's like I'm able  to do like the sporadic  burst of energy that he has and  then all of that low  stuff.
 Yeah.
  Trust me.
 Yeah so  they made  a ride, a roller coaster  actually in Universal Studios  Singapore.
 Oh right.
  And surprise  I got us all tickets.
 We're going  next week.
 Hey!  No I didn't.
 Sorry guys I'm a liar.
  I'm also aside from  the voice match of Antonio Banderas.
  A pathological liar to  people that I just meet.
  I have to tell one big lie.
  When you came in and you said  I'm not a liar.
 I just  took that.
 It turns out that was the first  lie.
 That was the first lie.
  And there's an on air lie which I just did  and then when the credits roll I'll be like  guys I'm also  the president of the United States.
  Not true.
 Not true.
  Also a lie.
 Reel me in again.
  But if you are in Singapore  please let me know how that  because there are moments in the ride where it's like  you're waiting and it's me going  the restrooms are over here.
  Yeah it's like yeah.
  There's arbitrary things they made me say.
  But I can't wait  to one day  go to Singapore.
  Aside from Singapore I was  in London for a wedding.
  To visit for a wedding.
  And I was able to see something  that I did that was a walk  through attraction like  by the eye.
 That giant  Ferris wheel.
 And that whole area is  basically like Times Square  or like you know Hollywood  Boulevard.
 It's basically like the attraction  site of London  England.
 And Dreamworks  has a theater there where you do a  walk through Shrek  thing.
 And my voice is there  as Puss in Boots.
 There's a thing  where he's on a screen  and for I don't know how they did this  I'm still like puzzled from  this day.
 He coughs out a hairball  and the hairball comes out of the screen  and like falls into the crowd  somewhere.
 Wow.
 Wow.
 And I'm like  how did they do that?  I'm like I want to know.
  I was like I have a question how the hell did you guys  do that? It's kind of amazing how they did that.
  I know how you did half of it  from doing it.
  I'm thinking of a voice and doing the coughing.
  But I was like how the hell did that come out of the  screen? I want to know.
  That's like catching the bouquet  at a wedding or something.
 You get that hairball.
  Antonio Banderas  Flem.
 Yeah.
  The other one I saw was that  you can assert if this  is correct or not but I saw that you  did the voice of Marvin  the Martian.
 Yes.
  Isn't that lovely? I did.
  Actually of all the characters  I've done for Looney Tunes the longest  over  12 years I think.
  Oh wow.
 12 Earth  years creature.
  Isn't that lovely?  For which was that another attraction?  I have it that you do that voice  in Warner Brothers Movie World  Dubai.
 Yes Dubai.
  In Dubai.
 Of all the places.
  So in Dubai somewhere in the  middle of Dubai  exists this giant  Vegas like indoor  theme park  that is Warner Brothers  and DC Comics  themed.
 And it's all fully  licensed and like there's a  Flintstones ride, there's a Looney  Tunes ride.
 Apparently  a Marvin the Martian  ride.
 Isn't that lovely?  And stage shows where I've done  like  they did something for Space Jam  and they did like something for the holidays last  year where I will  have to do you know  Christmas? What's that all about?  Woohoo! I'm greedy!  I hope I learn my lesson  in 45 minutes of dancing.
  Talking about this with you.
  And it's like someone in  like poor soul in this costume like  moving around to my voice.
  A ghost who resembles Fogger and Leggmorton  appears to Daffy to teach  him a lesson.
 Nah say  spirit!  No more spirit! I've seen enough!  I get it!  I'm an asshole!  Sounds like a good show.
  It's going to be a good one.
  The four of us are going to  do this right after this  and we're on this stage.
 I can  get us free tickets to it because we've been  got in a PR email saying we  can get free tickets but we have to fly out.
 Oh my God  are you kidding me? No I'm not.
 All we have to do is  finance the flight.
 All we have to do is fly  and put ourselves up and then probably pay for  food but the tickets  are free.
 And watch out for various like traps  that you might end up in.
  Don't worry about that.
 That's nothing.
  That sort of thing doesn't happen at a Marriott Courtyard  Dubai.
 Three white guys  and one Filipino Canadian.
 What could go wrong?  That sounds like  what could we get for that?  That sounds like a bunch of bad people scratching  their chin going yeah yeah  millions maybe.
 Perhaps  trillions.
 As long as we get  to go on the Flintstones ride.
 Yeah  yeah.
 You can hear me going  wow wow wow wow.
 I do Dino's voice.
  You're in that.
 Yeah I do that.
  Wow.
 Dino.
 So I heard  and this is true I guess  when I first  booked it I was going wow wow wow wow  I was barking out and  a very famed voice director  Andrea Romano who worked with Mel Blank  while he was still alive.
 She said are you doing  what Mel did? And I was like what's that?  And she's like he inhaled when he barked.
  Like wow wow  to get that like higher pitch.
  So there's another  trick.
 Another trick.
 That's cool.
 I spell it  on your podcast.
 Straight from the source.
  You have to inhale for Dino  apparently.
 Is there a  wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.
  Is there a Mel voice you can't do?  Oh man.
 Have you gone through his whole IMD  being gone? I'm just going to have to check them all off  the list.
  Yeah that's a tough one.
 I mean  I don't expect you to have actually gone through  but like is there one yet glaring one?  You know I know there's  one.
 There's got to be one that I can't do.
  Seems like you can do all the big ones though.
  Yeah the one the important ones  thank god.
 But I mean again it took  a while.
 Like even with Bugs  I had auditioned only  twice for Bugs in ten years.
  They only ever asked  people to audition for him in  the better part of a decade since I've been working  with Warner Brothers.
 And that just  goes to show how often they like you know want  to.
 I call it the shaking of the  ant farm.
 You know it's like this  crew of people build this thing and then like  another crew comes in and goes shh shh shh  it's all gone.
 And they're like we're going to do it  our way.
 But like  in ten years it's only been twice.
 And  the first time I didn't get it  that's when I got Marvin and then the  second time I was  lucky.
 So  you did get it.
 You got the foot in the door  then and now you're oh my god.
  It was a little nutty.
 It was a little nutty.
  But yeah.
  But even further I also want to talk a little bit  about bringing it back to theme parks.
  Growing up in Toronto  we have Canada's wonderland.
  Oh I was wondering.
 I've never  gotten it.
 I've always been curious.
 It's insane.
  And again I think for  most East Coast and  Midwest parks they  had license to use the Hanna Barbera  characters in the 90s.
 And I'm  thinking about Kings  something.
 Was there you guys know?  Well Kings Dominion and Kings Island  both had them.
 Yes.
  We did an episode once.
 I think like  35 theme parks have had  the Flintstones over the years.
  And then weird shady RV  parks in Arizona.
  It's just all over the way.
 Whoever wants it you can  grab the Flintstones.
 All the meth  you could.
 The biggest meth capitals.
  Yabba Dabba Doo!  All the meth you can Yabba Dabba Doo.
  All the meth you can  Yabba Dabba Doo.
 I'm telling you man.
  Hey Fred.
  Grinding my teeth too much.
  Oh good.
  But yeah.
 You know breathe in when he  nails me.
  That was like  the best time of my life growing up as a  kid in Toronto.
 Going to  what they called their kid section  was Hanna Barbera land.
  So you would have  Bedrock mini golf.
 You would  have like this you know the carousel  that had all the Hanna Barbera characters.
  I'm  pretty sure there was like again that  drive in that they had in  Flintstones where you could get like a Bronto Burger.
  I think there was a  jet.
 There was a Scooby Doo's  Goster Coaster which was awesome.
  And it was like it felt  like you were in the car.
 It felt like this ride  was going to fall apart at any minute.
  Which is half of the fear of being  on this coaster.
 Like  we're going to sue Scoob.
 Like I'm  going to break my neck.
  Like whiplash.
  Like is my nose bleeding.
  I can't feel my legs.
  But yeah it was unbelievable  that this place existed.
 And the one  thing that scared me the most about it was not  the rides or anything about it.
 There was a  person in a costume  that was Jabberjaw.
  The giant shark.
 As a child  I was terrified of this character.
  Something scary about  a giant cartoon shark that sounds like Curly  from the Three Stooges.
 Like  that I don't know about you but scares  the shit out of me.
  You had me a giant.
 That's plenty from any  other details.
 Shark that's just  icing on the cake.
 A cartoon shark.
  Maybe because my parents let me watch Jaws  and that's where my love for Richard  Dreyfuss comes from.
 Oh sure yeah.
  I like  general production value at that park.
  Are things a little rickety? What is the like  overall? So I mean they've  I've been there recently.
 Canada's Wonderland  and they're good.
 They're  they've held up.
 They still have some of the classic  rides but have gotten rid of a lot.
  They had this really great ride  there called The Bat and it was  kind of like it's almost like similar  to The Mummy where you do it one  you do the ride one way and then you do it backwards  and go like the complete opposite  way.
 But if you were standing  like right in front of it it looks like a bat.
  It looks like physically it looked like a bat.
  They called it the bat.
 I remember  Sky Rider was  a stand up roller coaster.
  You'd be standing up completely  and it would do like a full loop  which was insane.
  I like those.
 That's Riddler style.
 I like Riddler's Revenge.
  Oh yeah I remember that when that first came  out.
 I think I was here because that was  when Jim Carrey was the Riddler right? That was  like the big the big thing.
  Those were the days.
  The Great Canadian Mind Buster  that was like I believe  like a giant wooden roller coaster and I  remember this one.
 This is a great one.
 Top Gun  the ride.
 So the  ride based off of even  before Top Gun Maverick came out this  was like this is the real  sequel to Top Gun if I may say.
  You gotta go on the sequel.
  Oh yeah.
 But like it was the  first roller coaster where your legs were like hanging  like this.
 And I remember people  were freaking out because if you're  a tall gentleman they actually  did a thing a test where  they put like a tall mannequin  on the ride and I think like at  some point in the ride like the leg  had like gone off  and it's like oh my god we have  to make adjustments.
 Oh god.
  We didn't compensate for tall people.
  There are no tall  characters in Top Gun.
  Well Tom is short.
  Is that the secret?  Goose was a little tall but we all know what happened to  him.
  Tom doesn't let an actor  be taller than him in the movie.
  Not at all.
  Kaput.
  Kaput.
  On the end of like  a questionable  production value of four  attractions.
 You can imagine that phrase  is taking me to Six Flags.
 Yes.
  Let's dive a little into  Let's go back.
 The Six Flags  because you mentioned you do  frequent this place with your son  the Bug Bunny World.
 Yes.
  Like the kids area at Magic Mountain.
  You're fond of this place.
 It's as if the place  was not touched from the 90s.
  The characters and  everything that is part of  everything.
 Sun  died, sun damaged.
 Like  nothing is different  in that place.
 And if there is it might  just be the entrance signs or the exit  signs.
 But essentially  everything is untouched.
  Pepe Le Pew is still there even though he's somewhat of  a character again that they like to  sweep under the carpet.
  You don't sweep anything under the carpet when you don't have  the budget for new signs.
  You're like, what do you mean  we've got to take that apart?  That would require a wrench  and a screwdriver.
 We do not  have that sir.
 Yeah.
  Six Flags Corporation does not.
 You could  take your politically incorrect characters  and shove them because we're not doing anything.
  I'm part of the  local union 905.
  Yeah.
  To that, this is not  Magic Mountain.
 But I was looking up other  Looney Tunes rides.
  This is Six Flags Great America.
  Yes.
 There's some attraction.
 I don't know  what type of attraction but it's called Pepe  Le Pew's Peak.
  I just don't like  to hear the word peak after.
 I don't want to think  about any peak that Pepe Le Pew's.
  Oh, it's his widow's peak.
 It's just like he gives  him a haircut.
 That's the case.
 Fine.
  It's a little barber shop for all the kids who want  to get their hair done like Pepe Le Pew.
  That is the style.
 If you walk into any super cuts  you can ask really  Pepe Le Pew's Peak.
 Well they try.
 I mean  look they tried roller coaster cuts and it just  did instead.
 Oh yeah that's right.
 Six Flags  did at a briefly in malls  had a  kid's haircut brand where  kids don't like getting their hair cut.
 You know what we do?  We put footage of roller  coasters in front of them.
 Oh my god.
 That'll be fine.
  This business  will not fall apart in a matter  of a year and a half.
 Six Flags  roller coaster cuts.
  We did an episode on our Patreon.
  That's insane.
 Yeah, yeah.
  Did not work.
  Did it not? Did it spawn?  I need a t-shirt of that.
  Oh yeah that should be in your client's shirt.
  They had kids parties and stuff there too  so I'm sure there were things like that  out there.
 Yeah, haircut.
 Kids haircut  party.
 You know you would have  a party at the haircut.
 We all did it.
  We all had it.
 Guys, guys.
  It was the 90's.
  Everyone in the fourth grade attention.
 I got  a party this Friday.
 Don't cut your hair.
  Just come  to my party.
 Kids would show up  to school on Monday and not  half the class has their haircut and everyone  else would feel like shit.
 Yeah, yeah.
  You imagine being the only kid with  the hair over the ears going, hey where'd  you guys go that you all got haircuts?  I wasn't invited to this  haircut party.
  Or lawnmower accident.
  You were all, yeah, all separate lawnmower  accidents.
 Not talking about this anymore.
  Please really fly.
  The  thing is, in terms of like  what I did, now, for sure  it is like a has not changed  in forever kind of  land but I do  I haven't taken my son there  but I'm tempted to just because  like for all the stuff that Universal  and Disney have, they don't really have  just the little dopey land with all the kids  rides.
 With all the kids stuff.
 Is it nice  from that perspective?  It is because you know like  again, well my son is turning  old.
 Last night  we were at Super Nintendo  World.
 We have platinum  passes.
 We go like anytime  between three and six, if there's nothing  to do with your  super hyper kid, you take him to  Universal, you run around  you grab a Simpsons  donut and you go home.
  Oh Homer, those  Simpsons donuts are full of cholesterol.
  But Marge, it  has my face on it.
  You do though, you've been doing those too.
  They've just been listing the old names in the  credits and it's been you for years.
  Dan Castellaneta is not a real person.
  Oh wow.
 That's an amalgamation.
  That's true, that's not a lie.
  He's another Simpsons character.
 Matt  Greening created those people.
  Yeah I have much respect to  again, Krustyland.
  That's another subject you could  talk about forever.
 But  yeah, having a kid, it's limited.
  You can't bring your kid onto every ride.
  Except for the fact that I  brought him  and it took me three times to measure  that he was tall enough  to ride the mummy.
  He's turning seven so he's a six year old  and I brought him on the mummy and I'm like  this could be good or really bad.
  He could probably burst out into tears,  throw up all over everyone,  freak out,  die possibly.
  But we did it anyway.
  I took him once  and he wanted to go on it again.
  And I'm like  daddy is cheap, he did not buy  the ultra platinum which allows you to go  over and over again.
 It's the one and done  and we have to go home now.
  And he was so pissed.
 He was like  fuck you dad, you fucking ass son of a  he didn't say that.
 But he felt it.
  He didn't say it, but I felt it.
  But the Harry Potter roller coaster  at Universal, you can take your  six year old on that.
 And I think  that the Harry Potter ride,  the half motion simulation,  half roller coaster thing,  which is terrifying by the way.
  Because it has those  giant ghosts in there  and the big spiders.
  They still get to me every time.
 I know exactly where they are.
  It's terrifying.
  The giant tree that looks like a  two headed penis.
  There is phallic arms for  that tree.
 Yeah.
  I'm like come on guys, I don't need that.
  Just being punched by  giant bendy penises.
  The weird nightmare you have.
  Harry, look out for the  giant penis tree.
  Look out.
 Don't use your magic  indoors.
  It's Hans.
 It's Hans from  Dino.
  Now I have a gun.
  Ho ho ho.
  Just shift the accent  barely and then you got it.
  And you got it.
  I'm just  trying to think of details or if you've  done some of this stuff  at.
.
.
oh well that was one question I  had was that I was like  wait a minute, has Eric ever done  a voice in any of these shows?  And then when you said  no I don't think this place has changed in many  decades.
 I'm like yeah,  you were probably not recording new VO  for any stage  shows at the Carrot Club Theater.
  Yeah, at that time  I was just a kid.
 But even now  they don't really have any of those in  the theme park and it makes me sad  that they don't excuse me.
  Or that they don't have any like old  ongoing announcements in the park  where you could hear the character voices.
  Yeah, yeah.
 Absolutely.
  There is actually a little area in that  in the Bugs Bunny  world, Bugs Bunny and Friends world or whatever  it is, where it is  like I guess the equivalent  of.
.
.
it's like the equivalent  of American Gladiators for children  where it's like you have these  air powered like, these like  guns that fire like foam balls  and like a ball pit  and it's like this whole obstacle course.
  One of those indoor foam.
.
.
  Yeah, but again it has slides,  it's like a jungle gym, and it's a lot  of fun for kids.
 And I always  I'm always like two bottles of Purell  at any given moment.
 I'm like oh  God, he's gonna get something  and I'm gonna get something.
  But there's no voices in it.
  There's no characters like  on a cheesy speaker  going, be very, very  careful not to fall over  there.
 Ha ha ha ha.
 You know, like  there's none of that.
 Go to the Johnny  Rockets.
  Any character of your choice,  a COVID protocols  being scarily said  by a Looney Tune over the loudspeaker.
  It would be porky, right? Because like you could never  get through it and you'd be like what, what, what do we do?  What you have to do  in case  that you  run into.
.
.
 Oh boy, you know that  thing that I said earlier?  It's like just say it!  Just tell us what to do!  Porky, can you just say the word  coronavirus? That's all we need.
  Coronavirus.
  Coronavirus.
  We can chop the beginning, right?  We'll just use the end.
  We got what we need.
  Let me.
.
.
 Now where you do see  characters is in  commercials and I just, I wanted  to like play a couple  clips for you guys and get your thoughts on them, Eric.
  Jordan, if you can  play the clip,  let's see, I think it's just called Magic Mountain  Bugsworld.
 You can  sense like an evolution in  these ads because the vibe of  Six Flags changes over  the years and where it started  was like this very heartfelt  they're clearly going for Disney  money, which is not really  the vibe of Six Flags anymore.
  Or ever.
  Let's look at this, Jordan.
  Grab a smile, take a ride  Bugs Bunny World's just inside  It's metal.
 It is metal?  Yeah.
 Bugs sounds a little old  in that clip.
 Take a long  join the show.
 I say you're old enough  to go.
 Magic  Mountain was made just for you  Hold my hand, hang on tight  Let yourself run free  Six Flags Magic Mountain  Magic Mountain  It's what the world should be  It's what the world should be  You know  That really sounded like Bugs's  grandfather in that clip though  That was probably towards the end  of his career in late 80s  end of his life.
 89 was when  he passed away.
 Was his last, am I  wrong about this, was his last role Heathcliff?  Do you know that? Yeah, I think it was  I think it was.
 He was Heathcliff?  It was like, not Garfield  Right  It was the other orange cat.
 Garfield but not  Incredibly  heartfelt, right?  And then we start getting into the evolution of it  Jordan, the next clip is called  Great America Bugs  Birthday  If we have this.
 And I'm curious  This is something I'm curious if you've ever had to do  as any of the characters  which is rap.
 Can we play this clip?  Oh, yes  Hey, it's my birthday party at Great America  Don't be late  Hey, my name is Bugs and I'm here to say  We're gonna celebrate my birthday  At Great America  We'll have a ball  So many rides, we'll ride them all  Make a splash, take a stand  And that new coast is really grand  Great America  That's the gist of it.
 That's insane  You can tell it's a Jeff Bergman  So he was the first guy to do  To do voice  To voice Bugs Bunny after Mel Blanc passed away  was Jeff Bergman in his prime  He was probably like  Late 20s, early 30s  And Out the Gate, one of the best  voice matches  I think in history.
 One of my heroes  And I've gotten to work with him  Even in the capacity where I'm voicing Bugs  And he's voicing Elmer  Just a great guy  A super nice guy, super talented guy  And he actually voiced Bugs in Space Jam  A New Legacy  I had just got cast as Bugs for Looney Tunes  Cartoons, but in Space Jam  A New Legacy, speaking of rap  I was  Daffy  I say Foghorn Leghorn  Elmer Fudd  Marvin the Martian  And Porky  For that I had to do a rap  Which was  When people hear the name Daffy all they're thinking is duck  When they hear Algy  Which is Algy Rhythm  All they're thinking is yuck  I got LeBron and Bugs, so who should I fear  The best tune squad in over 25 years  You wanna be king of the web?  Well that's neat, here you go  You can start by massaging my web feet  Wow  And then Porky had to rap  And it was insane because  They asked me to do it  And it was funny because it was a gag  That they actually  Were trying to throw it out  But the director  Malcolm, he really wanted it in  And they asked me to do this rap  Because it just wasn't working  They had other people performing this rap and it wasn't working  And I ask  There's something wrong with how this is  Being from Toronto, we all think we're Drake over there  So I was like  Hey man, this isn't lining up  Something's off a little  And I'm like is the rap longer  Was it written to be longer  And they were like actually yes it was  And they're like, give me the full rap  And then once you guys have that  You'll be able to  Line it up or edit it down to  However short you want it  But as of now, I can't make this work  If this isn't lining up  I'm sorry, cause you know my rap demands  Are so out of  Reach  They gave me the full rap, we did it  And it got back into the  Film and it was like the whole joke  Was that  Porky was able to rap without  Stuttering, that's the only thing is that he  Oh the only thing he can do  Yeah, was rap without stuttering  That was the whole joke and I'm trying to remember that rap  And it was  Seems like this is part of the job  Ever since the 90s, if you're doing these  Voices, you're rapping, you have to rap  You have to, as soon as they invented that shirt with Taz  And the  I believe like I may have gifted him some modern stuff  But I think he just goes straight for the vintage  Like he loves the vintage stuff  So, if you're looking to get Kyle a holiday present this year  Make sure it is not modern  Make sure it is from  Like it has to say 1994 on it or something  And make sure Eric has not already  Purchased it on eBay  If Eric hasn't demolished the Phoenix  You're in a feeling of war  It's probably a good two  Is one more, in terms of like  Modern influences  Creeping into  The characters  You know, there were a few I was  Thinking about playing, but I think the one I want to see  I'm going to give it away what it is, which is  Hips don't lie  This is, I don't think it's Magic Mountain  I think it's another six, it might be Georgia  Possibly  Can we see Hips Don't Lie  Jordan  The Shakira song  Oh no  Oh yeah  Make a rabbit want to speak Spanish  Make a rabbit want to speak Spanish  Shake it Lola  Oh baby when you talk like that  You make a bunny go mad  So be wise  If you want to let people go  Turn your stupid eyes  Anywhere I'm tonight  You know I'm hip don't lie  This rap no feel this rise  All the taxes, attention  When you're eating tough, feel the conga  Let me see you move like you do in the carrot patch  Oh baby  Wait what? Wait  Let me see you move like you do in the carrot patch  Oh my god  Oh okay, cause the rabbits  Let me see if you'd remember if you did that one  Yeah  Let me see the way you move like we do in  I'm trying to fit some lyrics here  Uncomfortably, that don't rhyme  I believe that was Joe Laski  He was a stand up comic as well as a stand up comedian  He was in a  Sitcom called Out of This World  He was the wacky  Next door neighbor that were  That could be me right now  That's your sitcom part  But he was also the voice of Plucky Duck  In Tiny Tunes  Oh yeah, sure, man, did you grow up with that too?  I think we're probably all big  Tiny Tunes  And eventually he voiced Daffy  And Bugs  Talking about  Don't lie  That's the weird thing too  Is that I could do other people's Bugs  Wait, how does this work?  Impressions of other people doing  Right, right  So talking about hip hop, Billy West  The voice of Bugs for Space Jam  With Michael Jordan  On that soundtrack, there is a track on there  Called Buggin  Oh yes, I know Buggin  I do, I swear  And it is written by  Sean Carter  On the album  AKA Jay-Z  He did not want to be credited as Jay-Z  Using his god given name on that one  Yeah  Who does Bugs Bunny Bunny?  I'll give you some time to get more carrots  Every time I rhyme  Can a mouse write this?  I swear to you I know Buggin  We used to listen to Buggin playing N64  Really? Of course  Wow  Blasting Buggin, eating Cheetos for dinner  That was the life  Wow, I haven't thought about Buggin in years  If you call me right now, it's my ringtone  No, it's not  Wait, so what's  Billy West vs  Joe Alaska, or like any of them in terms of  How can you  Spot the differences?  For whatever reason, when Billy did that voice  When he sang on Buggin  It just sounded to me the most like  Anyone has ever gotten close to it  It's just within that song though  For whatever reason  I don't know what they did to it  What they treated his voice  But there was something so good about his performance  In that song  I feel like Bergman was the most accurate  And came close to  All the characters  Across the board  Like his Daffy is insanely good  His Yosemite is like  Amazing  In his prime, out the gate  Right when he started  And then Joe Alaska kind of had his own  Version of these characters  But again, what ties them all together for me  And then there was Greg Burson  Who did Bugs Bunny in the  Super Bowl commercials  Before Space Jam  So there was a 1992  Hey Jordan and hey Jordan  It was the one that was like  It was like a bunch of jocks  Antagonizing Bugs  And then the two years later they did  A super popular, you know they got my money  I bought the shoes and the shirt  They made another Super Bowl commercial  In 1994  Where it was Bugs  And Jordan versus Marvin the Martian  Because Marvin of course  Steals all the  Oh all the Air Jordans on Earth  He steals them all  And then two years after that is when Space Jam came out  Which I think was too late  I feel like it was two years too late  Had it come out like literally  The year after  I don't know, Joe Pitca was the one who  Directed those commercials  And I thought did an  Amazing job  You know, bringing those characters  Into the, you know, it wasn't  Hips don't lie  The way you move at the carat edge  The choreographers of that show  Are the new Joe Pitca  I'm telling you  Unfortunately that will be burned into my memory forever  Thank you for that  Can I ask a quick general voice actor  Question? Cause I know you  Go very hard, we like all these guys  Thorol, Ravenscroft and stuff  Do you have like your, who are your guys?  Yes, yes  Definitely, I was gonna say  Like if it's not Mel Blanc then for me  It's Don Messick again  He was like the voice of Papa Smurf  Scooby Doo  I believe he did Scrappy Doo as well  Puppi Power  Hey Uncle Scoob  Like it was just such a weird  Range of other, like he was always  The kid that if Mel Blanc  Was like, you know, the main character  He was the person that Mel Blanc was talking to  But he had such a nice rich  Voice as well.
 He also voiced Hampton  In Tiny Toons  Oh gee Plucky  I don't think we could do that  We gotta talk to Buster and Babs first  Yeah, he was Hampton  And I  I actually voiced a character  That he originated  Doctor Quest on Johnny Quest  He was the scientist with  The goatee and the bowl cut  And the, Johnny, Haji  We have to stay close to race  He's there to protect us  He was this guy, yes  A really white scientist  That's all he was  You're so great at those kind of like  Stiff, smarmy  Which seemed like a world of difference  From the Looney Tunes characters  But I guess Marvin kind of gets you  Into that area  Yeah, that weird like ethereal kind of like  Classic sounding character  And again, like bringing it back to Smash  Right, like we did a lot of that  Yes, you did the narration of the  There was this Casino Knights thing  Was one of my favorite things in the show  Casino Knights, but Tigor  Tigor was my favorite  Because it was basically just the send up of Lion-O  Yeah, yeah  That's another booming kind of voice  Where you know those guys were drinking  And doing cocaine  All sorts of things  You shouldn't be doing while on the job  He's like an animal  Adventure kind of character  Okay, how about this  I'm afraid you're going to throw a glass at me  That will have to be the voice  But I'm also addicted to horse tranks  Yes, that's my thing  If you're a half man  You know, half tiger  You're going to be doing some heavy stuff  You would be  If you never  I love the show  You did great, Kyle did great  The last episode of the show has so much great  This Casino Knights thing that you narrated  I love  You do the voice of Tigor  But a live action Tigor  In a scene that's meant to play as dramatic  On the beach  And Kyle's skip is doing the worst acting  The best worst acting you've ever seen  I just don't know how  I wish I were on set for  If there was anything I was ever on set for  I wish if I had seen that with my own eyes  Seeing a guy  In a tiger mascot costume  Acting all  It was like golden hour  Perfectly Dave McCurry  Overlooking the beach  Yeah, yeah  They built this incredible  It was like our turtles dream  Of what they would have done  In live action movies  Immaculate suit  Built essentially only for  Him to say really stilted dialogue  And not do  Even though this suit was capable of it  It's built just to do this  Hokey scene on the beach  It was perfect  And again, it's one of those things  Where you're like, man  If that ever had  Another season or another celebration  Of that show  It would have been like a live theme park  Version of all those  All those characters in the rides  You know we would have gone into some theme park territory  Hips don't lie with those characters  Yes, we could have  It's an alternate universe  An alternate universe Shakira  Alternate body parts that also  Don't lie  A lot of things don't lie  I know you've got to go, Eric  One more clip just as a fun little thing on the way out  And see if you can name  The voices on this one  This is Daffy centric  I think Daffy carries this one pretty well  I just listened to his birthday song  This is from Australia  This is a live show  That they put all of in like a  Souvenir video that you could buy  And I was pretty delighted by this  A souvenir video you could buy  Of Daffy's birthday  Of like everything you could do at the theme park  Which talking about Warner Brothers stuff  This was this crazy  Returns dark ride  Simulator ride that they filmed on  The set, like the sets were still up  And then they ran a camera through it  So it really does feel like  Being in a burden, it's like the closest to a burden ride  Imagine the ride was  You're having a close  Conversation with Danny DeVito as the penguin  And all that purple mouth juice  Is splashing in your face  He's on the verge of an orgasm and he's spewing black blood  That's basically  That's the ride, the Batman returns experience  Like what is it? And you put your face through this hole  And it's Danny DeVito on the other side going  Waaah, waah, waah, waah  I'm getting mad here  I'm gonna fuck the cat  It's Oswald, Oswald Cobblepot  And then I'm doing the same  I'm doing my Sumner Redstone voice  I don't have a lot of vocal range  But I think those are two that are good to pair together  If you have a whole demo reel  Of just Sumner Redstone  I believe you got the parts  I'm the only Sumner Redstone in the biz  I figured out he's from Boston  Actually the real voice, I need to get a little Boston in there  So that's my personal homework  Hold on, it's Hollywood calling  You got the part  By even thinking about it at all  I'm the only Sumner out there  The animated Sumner Redstone show that's coming soon  Little Sumner Adventure  Little Sumner Rising  Sumner Babies  Not all this is a legitimate baby  Hey, it's my birthday party  Confusingly, Jordan, I'm sorry  I have another birthday song that's a rap  Another one?  Do you have another birthday file?  I could not have made this more confusing  It's a birthday song that you might  You might know by a certain popular group  Each character has their own birthday song  Of course  I say it's me, Vogon, and I'm here to say  Wait, still not this one, oh no  It's always a character and they're here to say  That is how  That is how a bunch of lame writers  Thought rap was  My name is Tweety and I'm here to say  For so many years  They were a little out of it  They were up to their eyes in horse tranks  If I didn't send it  Do you also  Here's an alternate one, do you have a clip called  This is where bugs lives  Okay, great, let's do that one  This also charting the Six Flags  Bugs advertising evolution  This you can tell is kind of late 90s  Early 2000s, they gotta get a little hip  They gotta  I don't want to say what it reminds me of  It's an odd song to me  The second house party movie with Kid and Play  Exactly, those are the vibes I was getting  Six Flags is the only one  With his ride on the ride  This is where bugs lives  Let's eat them now  Ride the rides with mom or dad  Be great in time you ever had  This is where bugs lives  Everyone  Me and you  Find so much to ride and do  This is where bugs lives  That's still there, Bugs' house  If you go in there now  It's like the most  It's like being on the set of Seven  It's like  Yeah, this is definitely a crime scene  And it's Bugs' house  And there's like one  Sofa, like one seat  One fridge, and then there's like a hole  Where like actual sunlight comes through  And I feel like you're in like  I'm just waiting for like  I'm waiting for Morgan for you to be like  Don't open the box, whatever you do  Do not open the box  Fill the room with air freshener so they wouldn't be on to the bad smell  Yeah, yeah  Smells like dead rabbit in here  I'll tell you, hips don't lie  Yeah, I'm telling you man  Go there now, go there tomorrow  You'll probably see me there  You'll see, yeah, see Bugs' weird little room  We'll have to do an episode on Just the Room  Why don't we do an episode where we go and film it?  Yeah, yeah  That's the next possible  If there was a sequel to this episode  We might have to do that  I mean of course with our phones and not tell anyone  That we're doing that there, but  I think nobody would  The full camera crew  They're not looking out to have an idea  Like a 50 person shoot, I think  You could get away with  Recording an entire podcast in that  Little Bugs Bunny room  I think so, maybe that's the next  That's the only way we can top this is doing it  In his house, if there's room  For four people in there  That I'm not sure about  If one of the employees kind of tries to figure out what's going on  We just go, hey, get out of here  And they go, alright  Hey, weren't you just vaping in here kid?  Slip them a 50  Or a vape cartridge  And then they'll be on their way  Live from Pepe LePieu's peak  It is the podcast  We can't record there, no  Eric, this has been an absolute blast  I'm thrilled to say  Eric Bazza, you survived Podcast the Ride  I would go again  In the words of my son  Can we do this again?
