 Forever!  Dog!  Warning, the following podcast contains  sad French burgers  lightning McQueen's digestive system  face fire  and an attraction that strains relationships  that attraction being Disneyland Paris's  Armageddon, Les Effets Spatiaux  We drill into this massive  asteroid of a topic  with a returning Carly Weisel  on today's podcast  The Ride  Intro Music  Welcome to Podcast The Ride  the theme park podcast where because of  today's attraction we say go ahead  and close your eyes  go ahead and fall asleep  because we assure you, you won't miss a  thing.
 My name is Mike Carlson  joining me as always Jason  Sheridan.
 Hi.
  Hi.
  I'm just soaking that all in  because I was going to respond to whatever  you were saying with ah the  French, the French theme parks  have always been celebrated for their  excellence.
  There is a certain attraction  that is very terrible.
  Walt Disney Studios Park has always  knows a thing or two about excellence.
  Well we should, I really should have worked on a  French accent for this.
 But Scott Garner  do you have a French accent? Do you have?  Well I did look up how to pronounce  the attraction  which if this is the place  for that.
 Well and there's  another French pronunciation that might  come into play later but today we  are talking about Armageddon  Les Effets Spatiaux  There we go.
 So I wanted to get  that right.
 I'm sure it was still wrong in some way.
  Wait, with less?  I probably said less didn't I?  You said less, yes.
  No that's completely correct.
  Effets Spatiaux.
  Okay so I, alright.
 I did screw it up.
  That's not the part I thought I would.
  12 words from high school French.
 I'm sure I've repeated them on the show before.
  I know  an Orangina, the Orangina  drink.
 That counts?  Oh yeah, yes of course.
  It's a French drink.
  I know, it's hard to say what time  is it.
 Ask what time it is.
  Kelerateel? That's how, what time is it?  And you need to say that  as American as possible.
  Kelerateel?  Kelerateel?  Like an American nerd  would say it is how I'm saying it.
  Kelerateel!  That's the  did I do that pronunciation.
  Yeah, so we'll be doing  I don't know, there's not that much French stuff  I guess.
 Well if we talk about Disneyland Paris  I guess there is but  specifically like French stuff.
  Well it is where we are today.
  We are talking, but then this one probably requires  explanation from the ground up  that at the Walt Disney  Studios park  in Paris, that for a long time  there was an attraction based on Armageddon  and we'll explain why this  came up recently on Twitter  with our guest today who I'm so happy  is returning.
 I believe your fifth  podcast The Ride appearance.
  Long overdue.
 I think so.
  I got you to punch car.
 Welcome to five.
  We got something to give you  on your sixth.
 Five  timers club.
 I know.
 Five timers club.
  This is much more fun than doing  SNL I'm sure.
 Yeah.
  For sure.
 I think you're in this breezy  garage.
 For our podcast, very amusing  it's Carly Weisel.
 Hi.
 Hello, hi!  I am both thrilled  and mildly upset that we have to  discuss this attraction.
  At length.
 Sorry  to everyone listening.
 It's  Oh boy.
 We're really going to polish  a turd here.
 It's going to make  us as cantankerous as a late in  life drunk horse and wells trying to  read commercial copy.
  Yeah, you're absolutely  right.
 Well, yeah, you walked in.
 I mean, we've  been trying to figure out the right thing to have you and did we  find it? I don't know.
 Maybe it's not it.
  There's a horrible reason to have you.
 Who is  this? I feel like I come on here a lot  and I'm yelling about things and some people  agree and some people don't.
 Sometimes in this very  room or garage.
 And this  is something that I don't believe I've ever  heard a single person stan.
  I don't know anybody who's like  that thing was cool.
  Well, unless  I don't know.
 Let's do the check.
  Is there a secret? Is there a hidden  stan in this room?  In the room? In today's attraction, yeah.
  I've got a surprise.
 Oh no.
  No, I'm just kidding.
 This  one sucks.
  I'm pretty forgiving.
  I try to find like, well, but I did like  this.
 I there's  one little odd moment where I was  like, well, that's an interesting  there's a lot of interesting stuff.
  I think it's the most forgiving word you  could use.
 It's all interesting.
  I'd say confusing is the more frank way  of putting it.
 Oh, absolutely.
  Literally, because even going back and watching  it, I couldn't view the translation  screen in portions of it  and did not know what they were saying.
 Oh, yeah.
  I mean, the translation screen alone is  very, very much your  choice.
 A lot of choices  made, a lot of very confusing choices.
  Even the premise, I was like, that can't be  what this it is.
 What? OK, that  is what they're setting us up for.
 Got it.
  Pretty baffling.
 I imagine it was  even like videos are  tough to parse, but you did do this in person  at one point in time.
 Oh, yeah.
  And I will never live it down  because I dragged my  husband to Disneyland Paris.
 It was my first  visit there.
 I think it was 2016.
  So we took a full day  to go to the parks, which he was already  not on board with.
 And we  were like Armageddon, first ride we saw  at Walt Disney Studios.
 Let's give it  a shot.
 Started there.
  And then it kept waiting for the ride to  start.
 And then we exited.
  Yeah.
 Oh, totally.
  Yes.
 Well, especially  now.
 And we'll explain what it all  is.
 But this is it is  an attraction where you're in a space  transport vehicle,  essentially.
 And there's stuff going on.
  You see space through the screens.
  And that is something that now  in several cases qualifies  as a pre-show, a kind  of exciting pre-show in both  Galaxy's Edge and the Star Cruiser  experience.
 But yeah,  you might watch this and go, okay,  so now the door's open and the ride starts.
  No, no, no.
  This was not a different situation in the early  2000s.
 This sufficed  for them.
 Yeah.
 And this is  this park is was made because  of a contractual obligation.
  Essentially, the whole park was that they had  made a promise to Paris,  to the people of France, to the French  government.
 And that they what is this deal  where they had to give up the  land if they didn't fill  it with a park.
 Some  yeah.
 Perhaps they should  have.
 Yeah, maybe if  you don't have a good idea, although there's  also the flip side, because I genuinely  was thinking should they just not  have.
 But now they have all these grand  plans and I don't know how they're progressing,  but that kind of makes you think, well, maybe  you just put your foot in the door,  get a half park or  less on the table and  then down the road you end up because this is  going to be the home of Galaxy's Edge and  some frozen stuff.
 And what's the other  Marvel? Avengers Campus.
 Oh yeah, Avengers Campus,  which is replacing what we're  talking about.
 Do you  does that make sense? Like maybe it is  good that they.
 I mean,  I went in November.
  That's the last time I was there.
 It's a Disneyland Paris  and it's just I mean, it was a  dirt pile because so  much of the park, you know, to build all those  lands, they just had to raise  so much.
 Yeah, I went in  and I walked around and went, oh, that's that's it  now.
 That's it.
 There is nothing here  because it's all under construction.
 Were they  using the vehicle, the armadillo  to raise the ground  up just out  in front.
 They used to be out in front, I should  say the vehicle from Armageddon.
 Mike,  why did you even say vehicle? We all know what  the armadillo Armageddon  Armadillo Armadillo  and I assume we all like that's what Harry Stamp  and the crew like bear  and bear.
 Michael Clark.
 All the characters  we know.
 Yeah.
  I yeah.
 And we and we of course  also all know that this is a Disney movie.
  We I think we all we see the logo  for Armageddon and we all think  Disney straight to that.
  It's definitely not just a it is a  they happen to own it.
 It's a late 90s  touchstone movie.
  OK, it's a touchstone.
 All right.
 How much longer  did Touchstone go for? I feel I don't  I don't feel like it was long for this world  in the late 90s.
 I kind of didn't think about Touchstone  falling apart.
 I don't know when that  I feel like they just retired the brand a few  years later.
 Yeah, I guess so.
 Or just  rolled into something else.
 Maybe they rolled  it into Miramax because they bought Miramax  later in the 90s.
 I like Touchstone.
  I like seeing that little like circle go by  in the bar and when  you say I like Touchstone, you mean I like the logo  I like the logo.
 That would happen before the movie.
  I have a question for you.
 Does the  what brings you more joy the Touchstone logo  or this attraction?  Oh, the logo.
 The logo for sure.
 Yeah, yeah.
 All it's got  to do is fill that three seconds and then like  I don't remember what anything to Touchstone  was adventures in babysitting Touchstone  potentially.
 Maybe.
 Something I like  is Touchstone.
 So so like  it is the Touchstone logo is a pre-show  for something good as opposed to this  attraction.
 Is there something Spielberg-y?  Yes.
 Yeah.
 Probably.
  God, it's killing me.
 What is it? Why can't I name?  I guess I guess Touchstone's not that  great of a brand if I can't think  of one.
 But the only I like all  these logos too, but the only thing I remember as a  kid was that I knew if it was New Line  Cinema, there was a good chance like the Ninja Turtles  were coming after that.
  I remember that like they played a  tape and I would be like New Line Cinema.
 That's  the company that makes Ninja Turtles.
  Oh, they made Lincoln apparently.
  So a recent Spielberg-ish.
  So it went longer than I thought.
 Wild  Hogs, of course.
 Of course.
  Of course.
 I think Nightmare Before Christmas  and Roger Rabbit released  Undertowd Stone.
 Oh, yeah.
 Pretty woman.
  Was Old Dogs?  The Robin  Williams John Travolta movie that I get confused  with Wild Hogs? That I don't know.
  And which one killed the other, the sequel  to the other? Old Dogs made  there be no Wild Hogs too.
  I think.
 Oh, okay.
 I believe  so.
 And then Old Dogs  has the Travolta Every  Little Step music video with his daughter.
  I think so.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
  Which if you've never seen it, I highly recommend it.
  Oh, yeah, boy.
 Check it out.
 Do you want  to guess at the  highest grossing touchstone film?  I see I have it in front of me.
 Somebody  else.
 Mike Carley.
 I would like to not guess.
  No.
 Okay.
 I would like  for it to be Pretty Woman, but Pretty  Woman comes in at number five.
 Number one is  Signs.
 Interesting.
  Signs.
  Armageddon and Pearl  Harbor two and three.
  So kind of the ones that showed  up in the theme parks, I feel like,  because Pearl Harbor  was kind of incorporated into the  pre-show stuff at the studio tour and MGM  studios.
 It's in this a little in  the pre-show of this.
  Before we dive  into the attraction a little more, I am like  first of all, one  thing is this attraction is opened  20 years ago this week.
  So that makes it appropriate here to talk about  as did this entire park,  the studios park next to Disneyland  Paris proper, which is almost 30 years  old.
 Carley, you've been in the recent  past and I feel like it seems like your experiences  were pretty good.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You're a fan  recently.
 I would say that pandemic  era Disneyland Paris  is different.
 It's a different  because if we're comparing everything on  even playing field, like we got the Tokyo  parks in here, we  can't do that anymore.
 You literally can't  go to Tokyo.
 I don't even know how you would get into  Hong Kong or Shanghai.
 There's not a chance.
  I don't know.
 I haven't looked into this at all.
  So much of my not thinking.
 You can't  casually.
 I mean, I went to China  December 2019.
  Like basically the last  plane out didn't realize it and you  still have to go to the Chinese consulate  to get a visa to go into  China.
 Just to go at all.
 Just to go.
  So it wasn't easy to  visit in the first place.
 Now not a chance.
  So when you're looking at it, you're kind of like  we got Florida, we got California, we got Paris.
  Paris is the only like spice in the mix  that we got.
 It's the only fun foreign one.
  Oh, sure.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I'm like the hotels  are enough for you, but there's no rides  at the hotels.
 So  I don't know if this will be the case as this episode  comes out.
 But when I started reading about this  attraction, Hong Kong was closed.
  The Hong Kong park was closed because they  had done.
 Oh, like this  week essentially.
 Yeah.
  A few days ago.
 A few days  was closed.
 Shanghai, I think  partially closed.
 Maybe the hotels  and stores and the shopping area  open.
 Okay.
  Oh, rides are down.
 That weird.
  We had for a little bit.
 Interesting.
 Okay.
  Okay.
 So this is like, yeah,  if you want something that's not the norm and you go  to these places a lot.
 Yeah.
 So  it really shook it up.
 Because usually it's like  look at all these foreign options.
 And now it's  Paris or nothing.
 And  Paris, I'm someone who took the pandemic  very seriously.
 And so for  me, I felt much safer being in Paris  because there was a vaccine check that was required  of everyone.
 Everyone was required to wear masks  outdoors and indoors.
  Which when I went, I went twice  last year, which sounds  ridiculous.
  But I was like, I'm getting it back.
  I went over the summer and I went in  November.
 I think I made it go on like late September,  November.
 So.
 In both areas, like we're  still a little dicey.
 You know,  summer got okay for a second.
 Well in France, it was  great.
 Wow, wow.
 Yeah.
 Because they,  I mean, they masked 100%.
  I remember going in a department store, which is usually  a little loosey goosey.
 And every single  person was wearing a mask.
 Wow.
  So like going to the park was nice because you  could actually absorb the theming without  even thinking about what was happening.
 Geez.
  Oh, that's great.
 Yeah.
 So it painted Paris  in this different light.
 But then  again, I found myself screaming at someone  in my family because I was so hungry because there was  no food.
 That was my,  because I've spoken ill of  Paris a lot.
 I'm the only one of  the three of us who's done it.
  And there were things that I liked about it  and that I will praise  down the road.
 But the  big obstacle was the food thing.
  And we did a whole episode about that, the  village there, city walk,  and Disney, which is, I found miserable,  just crushingly miserable.
  Did you, did you find any way around?  There's like not even, no sector keeper  would be willing to exist.
  They'd be like, get me the fuck out of here.
  Somebody, I'm transferring  out of this.
 Somebody else take this assignment.
  Yeah, it's pretty  grim.
 Did you find any ways around?  Are there any weird secret,  if you want to survive it in a culinary  sense? Yes.
  And I found out about it too late, but I realized  the best thing to do is to completely  exit property and go  into the train station.
  Because the train station has  like, what is it, like,  Pré-de-manger or whatever those things are called.
  Like a little sandwich shop.
  You find yourself in a position going,  it's like, oh, thank God, a Pré.
  Nice.
 Yes.
 Literally  yes.
 Something with standards.
  I mean, I had,  I mean, this is off topic, but I had  maybe the worst Disney meal I've ever had  in my entire life at the  Disney's Hotel New York  Art of Marvel.
 Really?  Oh, wow.
 My worst one also,  there, I was wondering if you were going to head for  California Grill, which it's  insane, they call it the same thing.
 It's a very  stuffy restaurant in the Disneyland  Hotel proper.
 Awful, awful,  inedible food for so much money.
  Yeah.
  And we waited forever.
 Miserable,  miserable experience.
 What was up with this place?  So everything else I ate was fine,  edible.
 Like, the line is edible.
  I had a nice dinner at the  Manhattan restaurant where you  sit underneath a chandelier that looks like  Asgard, which was very fun.
  So like, I had a great meal there,  but the downtown restaurant  was all, it was buffet  style, but it was COVID, so they brought plates  of it to your table.
  And so you didn't know what anything looked like, and you were just kind of out here  taking a guess, and everything was themed  to different downtown areas in Manhattan,  so there was quote unquote  dim sum, and there were  like different cuisines from different places  that have different, you know, like Little Italy and things  like that.
 And I  honestly don't, I don't know if I  actually consumed any food at the meal.
  You didn't pick anything.
  It was so bad that my mom  asked for an allergy meal,  which was a frozen microwave meal  that took 20 minutes to arrive.
  Oh my god.
 Because she has a specific  diet for her health, but even still was like  I can't eat this.
  You've made me feel better.
  I've started to wonder, like, where my wife and I were,  was I being a baby? Absolutely not.
  Yeah, it is bad.
 It's really bad there.
  Yeah, yeah.
 And you're just, you're walking  around that mall, just like which,  what place do I get inedible  ribs from? Where am I, like,  I just pick your poison.
 There's nothing  that seemed like, I know I'm not getting  something good.
 It's just what, what can I  survive with? Yeah.
  This kind of sounds like my parents'  experience of, like,  the dining options at Disney World  in, like, 1990.
  Exactly.
 Alright, I guess I'll  eat another slice of pizza.
 Like,  I guess I'll have another hamburger.
  Like, you know.
 Yeah, which it doesn't,  it is not like that anymore.
  That's been a huge change  in, especially Disney,  but I'd say Universal to some extent.
  Universal seemingly upping their food  game in Orlando the last few years.
  A friend of mine just posted a photo of ramen  that she got, and I think  Islands of Adventure.
 What? Ramen.
  Wingservice Ramen.
 Where?  There's CityWalk has a bun  stand serving fusion, like  bao buns.
 I did, that's not  very good, but it's a nice idea.
  Nice, yeah.
  We applaud the effort.
 Thank you for trying.
  Thank you.
 Not, well, I ate worse things  at Disney Paris, so it's okay.
  The food in the park is  better if it's open.
 If the food  is open, then you're good.
  But everything's closed.
 Everything's closed.
  So that hasn't changed, because  I was there in 2014  and there was nothing related to pandemic  then, so, like, what, why,  why is it always like this? What's  up with this place? Honest to God, I have no idea,  and this time I was like, I'm gonna go prepare it.
  Like, I'm gonna beat the system, and  I made table service reservations  in the park during the day, and so  we ate, and the food wasn't  that bad.
 We went to kind of a Moroccan  restaurant, which was shockingly  good, or edible.
  But the other,  I mean, it's a crap shoot.
 I  have been four times  now, and the other two times I went,  I had at least one meal that was  pick and mix candy.
  To the point.
 Oh, so like how Mike  and I eat regularly.
 Oh, yes, yes, yes.
  They call that cereal around here.
 Yeah, I  like waddled in this time like, I know where I'm getting  my lunch at, and I went, and  all of it is gone.
  Just, because they're like, pandemic, all  of the candy is gone.
 Oh, no.
  Wow.
 Wow.
 That's like play  testing for their kind  of domestic COVID cutbacks  in dining that seems  to be, the wave seems  to be slowly rolling back.
  Like things slowly  opening up more here in America.
  You would think, like you would think that  would be a thing, because for a  famously maligned  park, you would think that would be a draw,  at least for the older people that were  skeptical of the park in general, like, oh, well,  it does have some nice places to eat.
  Like, you would think that might have been a good draw,  but I guess they never considered  it.
 I don't know.
 I've even  gone to Walt's, which is like their,  it's not Club 33, but it's their like finest  dining restaurant in the park, and you're  on the second floor of Main Street, and it's very  beautiful, and I think I spent  over $60 on a burger.
  Oh my god.
 And they gave me  nine fries.
  Is it exclusive? It is.
 No.
  Okay.
 So you can just make a reservation.
  Well, to people who love wasting money.
  Yeah,  that's what, it's like so  crazily more expensive  than fine dining in  the great city, 20  minutes away.
 Absolutely.
 But this time,  so the last trip we went on in November,  we went to a sandwich place,  and we got little baguette sandwiches  from this little man who made like  slapped butter on the bread and then put  on a bunch of meat, and I carried them in a brown  bag to the park, and I ate them on a bench,  and it was heaven.
  Wow.
 Nice.
 So that's the move.
  Just bringing in from entirely, it cannot  be Disney controlled.
  They have like just whittled  the taste out of anything.
 You need off-land  food.
 Yeah, yeah.
  Um,  well, that's nuts.
 Did you find stuff  to like about, that's I guess a question  because I, you know,  like the bones of that,  of the Magic Kingdom style  park I think are wonderful, but then  there's that food  and lack of staffing drawback,  and then Paris is all,  I'm sorry, the Studios Park is a whole mess,  but it's improved.
 How's  it feeling in 2021?  Were you charmed by anything  about the place? Yeah, it definitely feels on the up  and up.
 When I've been before, it's like, oh,  right, this is the one the company is embarrassed  about.
 Like you forget about it.
 Yeah.
 But  they're just sinking so much money into  Walt Disney Studios Park that it  feels like, like there's more to come,  and it felt very  optimistic.
 Okay.
  And I also had a really nice time.
 Like I really  appreciated some of the things they do differently,  like just the way it's laid out.
  I got lost at one point  because the left side  of the park is just, who knows,  just all over the place.
 You just keep walking and walking  and you like never reach anything.
  And then they had like such good character  meet and greets and fun  costumes.
 And I went to  some Mexican restaurant and I got a margarita  in Disneyland,  which was very fun.
 Sure.
 Oh, you're talking  in the main, oh, interesting.
 Yeah, like in  Disneyland.
 Right, yes.
 That was  where my enthusiasm went, where I was getting a  beer in the saloon in Frontierland.
  Like that feels pretty good.
  So that's a, yeah, yeah, that's a genuine.
.
.
  It was fun.
 I had a good time.
 I think once they build  out the other half and they have something new, like  the Frozen attraction, stuff that we don't  have in America, I think it'll be,  I think it's, I mean, I think it's gonna come around.
  It's on the way.
 Can you get a  beer in Tokyo in the main park?  Or no?  Don't think so.
 I'm sure we've all talked about this and I know  the answer somewhere.
 I don't know.
 It's been so.
.
.
 I can't remember.
  I only recall doing it in Disney  Sea.
 How many parks, how many  Magic Kingdoms can you drink and make Walt's  skeleton cry?  That's my question really.
 Is it only, is it  just Florida and Paris?  They're sinning.
 They're sinners.
  His old bones  tear up still in the ground.
  Carly, let me ask you, cause I  had a very hard time finding the current  answer to this question.
 Can you still  smoke within the parks in  Disneyland Paris? Because I mean,  I wrote down a joke about the  French smoking inside the  waiting area for Armageddon.
 Like  you can hear their disinterest  and they're dangling cigarettes.
 And I was like,  what is the smoking policy in France?  And as of 2017,  I found an article just  labeled Disneyland Paris to  enforce use of designated  smoking areas.
 So they had smoking  areas and they were not  but we were still just lighting  up everywhere as of a few years  ago.
 I don't know if COVID has changed  that.
 I don't smoke.
  I don't want to smoke.
 I've maybe had  like one cigarette in my life, but I would smoke  a cigarette on Pirates of the Caribbean  in any park and be thrilled.
  Yeah, that's cool.
 I will  drive down right now to Anaheim  and smoke a cigarette on Pirates  and it will be  one of the best experiences of my life.
  I didn't see as much smoking.
 I don't know  if the masks were a deterrent cause  they were required outdoors both times I was there.
  But I do remember  the time I went before that, which was a few  years ago.
 I mean, I believe the trash  cans still have ashtrays on top.
  Right.
 So you're not like, they're not really  saying no if you're  just laying out everything  you might need to smoke wherever you'd  like.
 Yeah, there were some trip advisor  reviews too of what seemed like  Americans or British going like  I was in line for something and someone  just started smoking in the queue  next to me.
  I'm like, uh huh.
 Yeah, that  sounds right.
 I'm kind of glad they didn't cause they  had all those partitions, which I feel I could  have very easily caught fire.
  Like in a Fantasyland switchback.
  Yeah, yeah.
  I didn't even think about it.
  Such a hazard.
 But  yeah, I mean, people still be smoking.
  But not to the comical  extent I once witnessed.
  Not to the Looney Tunes  level.
 Smoking a pack on a ride.
  Five at once in Bugs Buddies mouth.
  Turning dark green.
 Yeah.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Snooty laughter.
 There wasn't a lot of snooty  laughter with cigarettes.
 They only light  up when the national anthem starts to play.
  That's their version of putting their hand on their  heart.
  Here's the Studios Paris  question.
 Cause there's something I've thought  about proposing an episode on this and I don't  know if there's enough there or if people want to hear it.
  But I'm really intrigued by this.
  So one of the weird things about the Studios  Park is that  opening  day attractions.
 Armageddon is one and  another one is the Studio  Backlot Tour.
  Common thing, you know,  at Universal Hollywood and the Florida Studio  parks that opened where you go take a tour  of the studio, the working studio.
  This was never a studio.
  Nothing has ever been filmed here  other than one weird thing I found,  which I'll talk about at the end.
 But  so you're touring a non-existent  backlot and this has always been  a weird why is this there? We didn't even  do it.
 Like we knew we'd already experienced  enough misery.
 Like we know what this is going to be.
  But they changed  it.
 Now it's something called Cars  Road Trip.
  And it's still OK for people who know the  Disney World Tour  that culminates in a thing called  Catastrophe Canyon where you go into kind  of a Red Rock Canyon.
 You experience  a big disaster scene and then see  how it was faked and how they did it behind  the facades.
 But it's  explosions and a gas truck and all  this stuff.
 And they had that.
  But now they've made that  part of a Cars  thing where it seems  like it's all they've done is put a big  smiling mouth on the gas  truck.
 That's right.
  And in the concept art too, the big  Mack truck is like on fire  and smiling.
  It's a  depiction of that this is fine  dog on Twitter.
  It's a template of that.
  Was this weird thing going?  Did you get to experience this?  Yes, I did wait in line for this.
 Oh boy.
  Oh great.
 I did wait in like a 25  minute line.
  Wow.
 What can you tell us?  I mean I needed to know.
  There's a loose  narrative which I have to like  I have to applaud them for.
  For them figuring out a way to make this thing  Cars themed.
 Yeah.
 But  it was very loose.
  Like it wasn't very  compelling.
 But I'll tell  you I went with my mom and she had a  great time.
 Oh that's cool.
 She was  delighted by it.
 Okay.
 That's something.
  So you know all that stuff  happening in Catastrophe Canyon doesn't  quite make sense.
  In the cars road trip  purview.
 But what's happening  before that? Yeah that's my question.
 I think  I watched a video in this there's like narration  or do you get videos on like custom  videos or no?  I was severely under  caffeinated when I did it.
 But I  do remember that I think there  was audio and I think they were  basically like we're going on a road trip to different  stops.
 And so I think  Catastrophe Canyon was like a sightseeing  destination.
 Oh god.
  Where everything explodes.
  What was it before? Like would they be like  they just say a name like empty nest was filmed  here.
 Was that the lie? Like was that how it  worked before? I don't really  know.
 I know that the big center  piece was a bunch of sets from  another I want to say a touchstone  movie called Rain of Fire.
  Okay.
 I do remember this  now.
 Yeah Matthew McConaughey and the  Dragons in London.
 Is that right?  Oh yeah it's a re-creation of London.
  I didn't know Matthew McConaughey.
 I always knew  Christian Bale.
 He got a crazy beard and a  shaved head.
 So they would lie  about Rain of Fire having shot there?  Yes.
 They did have the sets but  they just plopped them in this French  field.
 Okay.
 So it was not  but it was the real things from a movie  that people didn't really see or like.
  That was a  late late summer  2001-2002  release.
 I just remember  like getting ready to like go  back to school.
 And  but seeing so they put all the  marketing.
 There was no  no other movies like coming out  seemingly.
 And so all the commercials  were like and you gotta check out  Rain of Fire folks.
  I have zero.
 I can't picture a poster.
  I don't know anything about  and you're like well I'm going back to school.
 Everybody's  gonna be talking about Rain of Fire.
  I'm not gonna make any friends this year  if I don't.
 My media diet  was much different from yours growing  up.
 I mean I was a  for a few years there I was in Axis  Hollywood every night kind of.
  Whoa.
  Not ET.
  Not entertainment tonight.
  Somebody had a crush on Nancy.
 He was very discerning.
  No.
  I like the electronic  charisma of Pat O'Brien.
  Oh yeah were you  what happened when the tapes came out?  I was buried as one in  Pat.
 All the Axis Hollywood  hosts have tapes.
  Push head tapes.
 Oh yeah you're right.
  Everybody's gotching.
  I don't remember what the Pat O'Brien  tapes was.
 Bad right?  Well it was just he was revealing  some fetishes.
 And there was some  explicit language.
 So it's available  online if you want.
 I won't repeat  anything.
  I'm not gonna lead you there.
 Not a thing I think about  a lot.
 I'm just saying that I have  some recollection of what it is.
  He didn't daunt on me to just get an entertainment  weekly subscription.
 Like it didn't  daunt on me that that would have been.
 I was an entertainment  weekly kid.
 Oh me too.
  Oh yeah.
 Oh and what is  Owen Gleiberman think?  We were very invested in old  Gleiberman's tapes.
 We seemed.
 What were you  doing that was not this?  I think honestly like sneaking candy.
  Stealing?  I was reading Jane Magazine.
  The best women's magazine  that's ever existed.
 That was my only  career goal and they went out of business the year  before I could get an internship.
 Oh really?  Yeah.
 Whoa.
 So all  I do now is just me grasping at straws  because Jane Magazine no longer exists.
  You're trying to have a Jane  esque vibe in whatever  venue.
 I mean I had one career goal  and it went out the window and I'm just  seeing what happened since then.
 Can you?  That was started by someone  notable right? Didn't it? Yes.
  Oh why am I blanking out her name?  I know this.
  Good gotcha question.
  Was her name Jane?  Jane Pratt? Yes.
 Who's Jane Pratt?  I know that name.
 I don't remember what Jane Pratt was about.
 Yes and then she had  XOJane.
com which was like a  website version of it but it was recent  and it wasn't the same.
  Can you reboot it? Is she alive?  Yeah but  I mean not to.
 Can you get the IP?  I'm sure a venture capital firm  that probably owns the IP  would love to partner with you.
 Seriously.
  I mean magazines are not a sustainable  form of income  because like print media plus  advertising not great but  ideally if they rebooted it  I would run the other direction  from theme parks.
  So you would have banned theme parks completely?  If Jane Magazine came back?  You would set the ride  on fire you were on and run  Oh yeah I would extinguish my cigarette  on the side of the boat and then  just pounce.
  Well if you put it out there have you put it out  there publicly that you're willing you want to reboot  this? No because as someone  currently in the publishing industry I  understand why it's not rebooted.
 It's not the  train you want to jump on.
  Yeah.
  Maybe you can reboot her talk  show.
 She had a talk show on Fox.
  Oh wow really? And she was the founder of  Sassy Magazine.
 Yeah Sassy was  OG Jane Magazine.
 Oh okay.
  Wow.
 Sassy was cool too.
  I just know that sketch that Hartman's  that might be one of the that's the top ten for me.
  Which one was that again?  I don't know he's the editor of Sassy Magazine.
  Is that one that he hosted? Sassy's Sassy  Sassy S Boys.
  Where he draws a little map of  the SS Sassy went to Sassy  Island and I won't recap  this full.
  Wow.
 Well we've all said the  magazines we liked.
 Yeah  you're learning so much about us  every week.
 I  well I'm really excited to hear about  Cars Road Trip.
 I'm glad  it was at least passed a mom approval test.
  There was this oh god I have  to mention this there was this like food truck  but also I don't know to get real  heady with it I don't know where the food truck landed in  the vehicle  world of cars like I don't know if this food  truck was a car who was like serving human  food out of its car self.
 I'm not sure  I didn't really think about it too existential  but it did have it was sponsored by Baby  Bell Cheese and I feel like they had these  little like Baby Bell Cheese sandwiches  with cars and prints on them.
  Oh.
 And I didn't get one  and I saw somebody when I was so jealous  and I still am.
 That sounds good.
  I like those cheeses.
 That might have been a snack savior in this weird place.
  It's like bunch of fun cars food  that we don't have in America.
 Did the car  have a face? Did the food truck have a face?  I feel like it did.
 Okay.
  So there was a human inside the  guts of a car.
 Yes standing inside  the anthropomorphic car  hypothetically.
 Like in the intestines.
  Kind of pushing its arms out through the intestines  of the car and Baby Bell  Cheese Sandwiches.
 Yes.
 Serving hot little  spreadable cheese sandwiches.
  What is a food truck to you  if you're being lit up on the inside?  Too much.
 Don't even  worry your pretty little head with it.
 It is  too much.
 That's what like.
 Ka-chow!  What have you got today?  You just  went through the living room where my son  watches Pixar movies all day  and like if you  I think a lot of parents have to be this way.
  Like if you have cars on a lot  you have a new question every  viewing.
 There's not one time that  it's on.
 It's on hundreds of times.
  Yeah.
 Oh yeah.
 And I like  the new one for me is early on there's a  race going on.
 It's showing everything around the stadium  and then there's a bathroom  and the men are just going straight  in and the women it's a big long line.
  You know like sporting events are.
 Sure.
  What are the cars doing in the bathroom?  What does a car  need to do? Does anyone  have any.
 I have  fluid flush.
 Crass ideas  about what it is.
 I suppose.
  So because they like eat oil  at an oil.
 It flows.
  I think they go and eat oil and gas.
  Yeah they do.
  So it's half.
 They're all like half  well they're not half human but they're  human car.
 Are they like  are they defecating out the  tailpipe or something?  What? Defecating what? What's coming  out? Exhaust?  I guess it's just exhaust and oil?  Exhaust in front.
 They're exhausting  all the time.
 Yeah exactly.
  Yes.
 It's not a private matter.
 That's why I'm  saying it's probably like  some sort of version of like excrement.
  Or like an oil change.
  Is it like if there's like  a well like you end up with like a gunky  build up in the car.
  Yeah I mean.
  The car's going by right now.
 Let's ask  us sir.
 Yeah let's ask the car.
  They don't know either.
  I mean they spent a lot of those movies  cursing their existence at whatever sick  god would make them this way.
  It's what it should be.
  It's just full and analyze.
  I would just watch documentaries made in the car's  verse about why.
  Just why.
 Yeah.
  Wasn't there? Didn't someone say that  there's evidence in the movies of humans  on the planet?  Oh like they're fossils right?  What? I can't remember what maybe  it was a joke.
 I can't remember but I feel like there's somebody  pointed out something in one of the movies  that there's like evidence that humans did live on this  version of the earth at one point.
  Geez.
 So I don't know.
  Maybe that was a joke.
  I wonder what the evidence is.
 If you're listening  and you know.
 All I want to do  is think about cars.
 I'm broken  by this question that you posed.
  I can't go on.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's really  I'm not happy with any  answer.
 I mean if they are just like you know  but they need but the oil  maybe it's like us.
 We eat  things and then some of it we use to power  us but other some is  waste.
 But what's waste for a car?  Do I use all of it?  All right.
  Look I think we're all a little freaked out.
  Maybe we should get back to the rock  rock solid storytelling  of 1998's Armageddon.
  Clarity.
  Simple ideas.
  What are you looking up Mike?  Bones.
 Well I'm looking up all the  times that there's bones in cars.
  There's an article here that says the disturbing  theory explains Pixar's cars.
  But my phone is taking too long to  have it load.
 So we can come back to  it.
 We don't have to do it.
 When we get to radiator, springs, racers  we'll ignore the ride and focus on all  this.
 But for now  but the what we came here to do  let me explain why we're  doing this with you.
  I was looking at Twitter and our  friend Kevin Perger defunct land  put out a prompt  and it was this.
 I am once again asking for  suggestions for the worst theme  slash amusement park ride you have ever been  on that is now defunct.
  I saw you responded and the  response was Armageddon at  Walt Disney Studios Park.
 Yeah did not hesitate.
  Yeah you knew it.
  Oh yeah in coming up with that decision you had  no you didn't think about any other candidates.
  It was like what color is this guy?  Just  can't even if I tried to think of another attraction  couldn't even think of one.
 Wow wow.
  I got so excited  because I like oh that's right that we haven't done  that have we what an insane thing  and I feel so similar just baffled by  it.
 Being in there in person doesn't  help.
 Let me add that  Lentesta jumped on and  added a response  to you this.
 I left  wondering if it was some sort  of idiomatic French parody.
  It was not.
 It was not.
  So with this pile  of opinions about this ride well this  is some this is a podcast  the ride magnet.
 I think we got  to dive in.
 Were you guys familiar with  you knew this existed at least but maybe  hadn't done the dive on it.
 No  I don't think I actually yeah I was new  the video is when I was watching I go I don't think  I've ever watched this before so it was  on the radar but it was not I was  not well versed.
 Sure.
 No I didn't  know the specifics I knew it was  there I had heard it was bad  and I briefly remember it MGM  studios in Florida there was a  little Armageddon  thing like  like videos or a walkthrough or  something.
 I don't think it lasted very long.
  They had a making of space that  and things would change out but you got  after in the  Twitter flurry that followed  Carly you got a response from  somebody.
 Well explain what the.
 Yes  so there was in the thread there is someone  who is responding and fully  being gaslit by everyone on the thread  who's like that was never in Florida  and then they found a map that showed  it and they also called into my podcast  very amusing and I was like you  know what I'm going to put a pin in this this will be answered  in the future I can't tell you where or when and  this is that date but there was  you were absolutely right there was  a version of this I guess  in studios in Florida.
  Yeah not I  don't I remember seeing  it very briefly it's not  fully I don't think it was fully built out  like it wasn't in a room  space station and all this stuff  yeah I don't think it had the full  effects it was in the room  with like like twister back  draft which is this is kind of reminiscent  of do you think they did anything do you think  like they showed the here's the  history of special effects which happened in  this or the little Michael  Clark Duncan appearance.
  I think  if they were going to I mean  they put it in the American parks I think it was probably  a lot more props and a lot  of montages with the  big movie stars  that are in Armageddon  but absent of the in this attraction.
  Yes.
  Other than the one you got one.
  You got one you got a great performer show  up and I'll  give the Russian guy you know  that guy is he in the movie?  Is it Stormare?  Is it Peter Stormare? Who's the guy?  That's who I looked like in a blurry  Stormare type.
  Yeah I'm not totally sure.
  I don't know.
  So alright so there was some there was a little  making of attraction but  maybe not the full thing.
 I also recalled  strongly the rumor  that this was going into  California Adventure and that it was  maybe being considered as an opening  either as an opening day or  as what do we draft in  quickly in the immediate  decay of Superstar Lemmo?  Because there's that big space  back there with it's that there's  that weird building that was the who wants to be a millionaire  thing and now it's like a they're just committed  to being a store I guess.
  It's a Marvel thing now  I haven't seen it as a Marvel thing.
 Okay okay.
  But I recall  seeing in some online forum  well there's a lot of good buzz about  this Armageddon thing that's going  into Paris so maybe they'll just draft  that quickly into California  Adventure and that was still in my head  when I walked up to  the attraction in 2014  was whatever commenter said  I heard this is good.
  2014.
 Yeah yeah.
  That long after.
 Wow.
  So I still I went in actually not  knowing it was  a disaster.
 I was like in  my mind this could have been like oh maybe oh they actually  like took the universal  this formula of a little  bit of behind the scenes and then you're thrust into the  thing and took it to the next level.
  That is what I was actually expecting  when I walked in the room that day.
  As one I mean the facade is  very like the logo is very enticing  and you're like this is going to be fun and adventurous  and you are truly standing  in two rooms.
  And that's it.
  And one really claustrophobic hallway I remember  connecting it's this really like depressing  file through to  like it's a long walk to that  other.
 The sign looked like it was  a little bit DCA though as far as  like a thin  like not so  that's my.
 Your recollection?  It's a little small  on my screen here but this is  this view kind of encapsulates  what this park was like  at least at the time.
 Where is  this like kind of like  the tower of terror behind it.
  Building and yeah and then the Armageddon  logo is really just kind of  it's very flat plastered on and you're looking at the  back of the tower of terror which almost no  park besides this  do you have a view of and the back of it looks like  nothing.
 Yeah.
 They didn't  put the Hollywood tower  sign on the other side it's just  blank.
 I think it's still that  way because they didn't expect to  be doing that.
 Think about when this park  opened.
 It's a really  depressing opening line up where there's no tower  of terror yet.
 Obviously there's no Rat Tatooie.
  There's no there's not this crush coaster  which you said you like.
 Yeah I love crush coaster.
  That seems cool.
 Yeah yeah.
 Wait that's another  thing about like yeah that  seems pretty neat.
 That reads in a  ride through.
 And this sign does not  have the outsider art appeal  of the rock and roller coaster sign with the big  CD.
 Ah, that Aerosmith.
  Yeah yeah yeah.
 Now that is  it's yes it's at least  so far in that direction  that it is amusing.
 Yeah it  went from being like  okay yes CD is how we all listen  to music in 2002 to an  interesting an acronym when it  closed in 2019.
  Well it's like how those you know you  go to the 50s hotel in  Disney World or the 50s wing  of Pop Century and there's big records  and jukebox.
 It became an  accidental 2002  period piece way after the fact.
  But again  you know what I mean you bring up a good thing because  these things were these odd facades  in the back of Tower of Terror are all kind  of in the same zone  which in our rock and roller  roller coaster episode I called Aerosmith  Alley.
 It really is  like a full Aerosmith  zone.
 Which is the only thing that makes me  sad that this is gone now.
 Yeah.
  Aerosmith had two attractions  for Aerosmith.
 What a stronghold.
  Oh my god.
 If you don't recall that  they did the theme song of Armageddon  I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing as you quoted  in the beginning.
 And you would  hear their music I feel like in this  whole so it kind of was like  you know what is now going to be  become Marvel  and Avengers.
 Yeah.
  Wasn't what the Avengers of rock  for sure yeah.
  A team up of the five greatest  musicians on the planet Earth.
  Wait that's that's the  thing that I that I looked up and I'll probably  screw up I'll screw this up  because I screwed up the first pronunciation  but here I looked up how to say this  in French.
 Les mauvais gossons  de Boston.
  Les bad boys de Boston of course.
  In French.
  If you wanted to  engage with some French people  talk about the best of American culture.
  They were saying that phrase they were saying  that phrase every day when they were out there.
  Can I shout out to a friend of the show Julia Prescott for getting  me Joey Kramer the drummer for  Aerosmith's coffee as a gift.
  Oh.
 Recently.
  What's that called again?  I'm flanking on it.
  It's some rock thing.
  Wow.
 Joey Kramer's rock coffee.
  Yeah let's call it.
 If I can  toss out just a big picture thing  about Armageddon  Leif-Expecio  it opened in March  2002 and closed  in March 2019.
  Which is 17 years.
  It was open until 2019.
  2019.
 Like there's a world where I had  an iPhone 11 and this thing was still  open.
 Correct.
  Get clear footage.
  Oh yeah because you can look at the low  light.
 There's videos of this that are  immaculate actually on YouTube.
  Very good HD.
  Rocking and roasting coffee.
  I don't know why I should have known.
  And I probably could have gone  through and made a list but the thing  that stuck out to me I was like  17 that's bigger than something  right and I looked it up.
  This lasted longer than Horizons.
  Horizons was around  less time.
 Even if you  combine the first run of Horizons  and then it closed for a little while  and would operate seasonally and then of course  it closed on the eve  of the new millennium.
  If you add up the two runs  of Horizons it is less than  the one run of this attraction.
  Oh my god.
  It's one of the longer running Disney attractions  weirdly.
 It beat a lot.
  It beat like probably not interspersed.
  It beat like flying saucers.
  I think it was the ones that people had thought of that it  beat.
 They must  just have such a need  to put people somewhere and so few  attractions that they had  to keep it open.
 Yeah.
  Just no choice.
 Because there's very little  to do at this park.
  Now they're starting to close them because they have  some better stuff and they're building better stuff.
  Will be great in the future.
 Currently  nothing.
 Yeah boy.
  It's grim.
 Grim decor  wise.
  And the dated  well it also leads to like  Armageddon was a big movie but the cultural  footprint of it by 2019  is very slim.
  Yeah.
  Not the size of Texas.
  If you want to check out Armageddon  and refresh yourself, boot up  your Fubo app.
 That's where  it's currently streaming.
  We're all Fubo heads here.
  Yeah so much not Disney  is this that it's not on Disney Plus.
  Yo yeah I didn't even think about  that.
 Yeah weird.
  Fubo.
 I feel like  we've name checked a lot of them but  I don't think we've ever mentioned Fubo before.
  Fubo I think is a mix of on  demand and some live  channels.
 Like I feel like  Pluto.
 Fubo is a  Pluto.
 Well let's  not denigrate Pluto.
 Yeah yeah  I know.
 Pluto is solid.
 Yeah yeah.
  I just found the Bob.
 There's a 24 7 Bob  Ross channel in Pluto  and it's really it is really relaxing.
  I never really sat down and watched that show and I was  like oh wow now I see  like now I get it.
  Very calm.
  I one thing  just before we move on from  well who knows if we can we ever really  move on from discussion of the bad boys  of Boston.
 Of course yes.
 But I did find  a video that affirms  that the man himself  was there.
 Visited Aerosmith alley  when Aerosmith alley was still intact.
  And this is from the  this is from the Instagram  account of Miss  Leva Little and that's  Liv Tyler.
 That's his daughter.
  So they went together.
  Recently.
  When was this? I thought.
 Or maybe  I'm thinking he went to.
 2018.
  So a mad cap  tour.
 A mad  hatted tour by Stephen  Tyler of Aerosmith alley.
  Daddy where are we?  We're at Disney World  in France  and there's a rock and roller coaster but there's  this and Liv.
  Liv.
 Liv.
 He means Armageddon.
  This is going to take a minute.
  He's running over the turnstiles.
  This Armageddon character posters.
  He's tripping.
  He's moving  fast for a older man.
  It's her.
 It's Liv.
  His daughter.
  He makes an I'll get ya face.
  He's like he should have.
 I mean first of all  I agree he should have played her father.
  What a movie that would have been.
  Him glues voice as  Liv.
 Liv.
  It's your fictional absentee father.
  It's your real life absentee father.
  This park is a  simulacra of a  movie studio.
  And this video is a simulation of a father  taking his daughter to Disney.
  The Disney park.
  All it took was everyone getting  very famous and being able to use this as social  media content.
 Yeah.
  They got it done.
 And pictures and  footage of themselves in this park  also assisted.
  Let's hang out.
 Just you and me at that park  where there's visual depictions of both of us.
  That's nice.
 You would do it with your parent.
  We'd all do it if we were depicting  He you know I'll say this about Stephen Tyler.
  He loves that they're in theme park  stuff like he's like I think he's  the only one in the band that's excited  about it.
 I could be wrong.
 Yeah.
  But like I think Joe Perry turns his nose up  a lot at like you know  the rock and roll music.
  Yeah.
 But then the stuff that's not like blues  I feel like Joe Perry doesn't like jaded  the song that we like.
  The most.
 I feel like he doesn't  like all that stuff.
 He doesn't like pop music  as much.
 He wants to do 12 bar blues with Johnny  Depp and Alice Cooper in the Hollywood  vampires and that's it.
 I went back  and listen to the rock and roller coaster episode  to see what had come up in this negative.
  Every bit of what you just said.
 And it's also  it's an interesting window in our  podcast chronology because  there's so much  naivete on your part Mike where  you bring up Aerosmith and maybe you're  expecting a little snark.
 And in fact we're both  Jason and I are both like I kind of like  Aerosmith.
 Yeah.
 I kind of like the song  jaded.
 You go oh so  you mean it's the finest song  ever made and I can bring up the  bad boys of Boston in every episode  from now on.
 It's nice to see like  the creative spark.
 That's like the conception  of the talk.
  That's where the spark  was magic.
 And I was like yes  more.
 Your heart is glowing.
  Yeah.
 Oh my god.
  They seem so down.
  Did we talk about jaded being played at school  dances because that's the memory I'm having  right now.
 I don't think so actually.
 Oh  really? I feel like  it would have come out.
  Did I in that episode did I talk about the fact  that I was going I went to a high school  dance with a girl and  I don't want to miss a thing came on.
  You did yes.
 I did say that.
  But she rolled her eyes at it.
 She was  like this is sucks.
 This song sucks.
  And I was like what?  What's wrong with you?  Your lot in life  is you're still experiencing  feelings about Aerosmith Carly.
  No I mean I will say every time  I go on Rock and Rollercoaster I'm like they do  have a robust discography.
  I have a new respect for them every  time.
 Hits in a lot of decades  except for the last couple.
 But  a lot more than most bands  have.
 No like preteen memories all  tied up in their songs though.
  Okay.
 Yeah.
 I wish.
  Yeah.
 That's okay.
 That's okay.
 I'm upset.
  But that's okay.
  It'll deal.
  During that whirlwind  tour of the Armageddon campus  you get to see this is the big  decoration  outside of this building is are the  individual character posters because  Steven takes Liv to go see her  character who is of course Grace.
  Of course.
 Yeah.
 We know Grace.
  And we pass by a big poster.
  I took this is a picture I took  when I was there is the mundanity of a  huge poster of Steve Buscemi  and above it it says his character's name  Rockhound.
 Yes.
  Go to Disney  Ferret.
 Pay as much as for the Castle  Park and see a big poster of  Rockhound.
 Fantastic.
  That stuff is all good.
  I feel like if the ride wasn't even there  it would be better actually.
  Just posters and like the sign of  Armageddon and then you go that was fun to take  pictures with the poster.
 Yeah.
  Get a picture of me with AJ.
  You know Ben Affleck's lead leading  man character AJ.
  Mr.
 Animal Crackers himself.
  The most  romantic scene.
  Oh yeah.
 Well and do we talk about the Affleck  the commentary track that everybody probably knows about?  No I don't know about this.
 Oh really?  I think it's on the Armageddon commentary  and I don't know if Affleck is drunk or not  but he's like just talking  about Armageddon but just  mocking it like crazy.
  He's just like going back and forth with the dialogue  like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense.
 We're going to train  drillers to go into space.
  We're not going to train astronauts.
  He's just like and it's much funnier than what I'm  doing here but he's relentlessly picking apart  the logic of the dialogue  in the scenes.
 It's gone around a few times.
  Because he would have recently have won  an Oscar for writing movies.
  Sure yeah.
 Oh yeah.
  Yeah.
 Yeah he has some clout.
  You can say that stuff.
 It is very funny.
  So the outside is spectacular.
  We all look great.
  Yeah.
  Olivera Smith-Ali is great.
  I was excited as Stephen.
 But then you get  inside and you go into a pretty sure  we get very Universal Studios from here.
  They very much are borrowing a Universal.
  I feel like it's an insult to Universal Studios  to say that this is Universal Studios.
  Yeah sure.
 Because those things are so much better.
  Yeah yeah yeah.
 Back to Aerith and Twister  look like you know they're bringing their A game.
  Compared to this.
 Yes.
  Two other things that stuck around for  a while.
 But anytime I wrote them  the crowd always seemed like oh that was cool.
  Like that was cool to see.
  Stuff fall down.
 Stuff explode.
  The effects.
 The music.
 That sort of thing.
  I understand why I  saw this.
 And this both  pretty successful movies  too.
 Yeah yeah.
  Lessor hits than Armageddon.
  But Twister I think stuck in  the popular consciousness for a while.
  Yeah I suppose.
 Backdraft less so.
  We found that weird that there's a  backdraft thing.
 But a better show.
  Better show.
 People just.
 Explosions  are kind of pun not  intended.
 Universal.
  Like always popular.
  Which this does have.
 But you go  into this room and it's one of these  where here's a guy.
 What are you?  You're from the studio.
 You  represent the director.
 You're a  coordinator.
 Unclear.
  Unthemed basically.
  Just a room with a bunch of monitors.
  So much French.
  So much French.
  There's a lot of  standard definition  footage.
 There's a lot of 3x4  screens.
 And there's translation  like  three different.
 There's two screens  with translations on it.
 And three  different languages each.
  I believe on the screen.
  Yeah yeah yeah.
 Okay.
  So a lot to look at.
  And you watch a video.
  Well it's explained to you  that you're going to be in a scene  where.
 I'm sorry.
  You're getting on a Russian  space station.
 And so I  guess the scene in the Russian space station  is.
 It's  in orbit and a hundred and seventy  plane clothes  people.
 Not in astronaut  gear.
 From all places  all around the world.
 They're all  just in regular clothes  standing around.
 Not  holding anything.
  Right.
 Well that's what space stations are filled with.
  Generally.
  Yeah like one to two hundred  random people.
  Who just came in to escape the sun for like twenty minutes.
  Yeah.
 Yeah.
  No space is for.
 It's for.
 Commit.
  It's for scientists and astronauts and Pete Davidson.
  That's what space is for.
  So yeah I know it's one of these  you're going to be in a scene and remember to be  scared.
 And you're getting your little  low down.
 But then you watch  a thing about the history of  special effects and their  definition of this is like any  I mean anything that happens.
 Yeah.
  A fan is a special effect but  also all of Star  Wars is a special effect.
 Like it's  the full gamut you know.
  Yeah that's right.
 It seems  like an actor acting as a special  effect or something like is it's fake.
  Like that's how broad their  definition is.
 Yeah.
  Makeup is a special if it's  not there specially.
  So you see a really unfocused  montage that's a bunch of  everything that qualifies as effects and everything that Disney  could like get the rights  to at this time  which is among the things I spotted  Rocketeer  Inspector Gadget.
  Live action and  Inspector Gadget.
 Live action Matthew  Brajk Inspector Gadget.
 Not the French  Stewart.
 Not French Stewart no.
  Darby O'Gill and the little  people in there.
 One of the great  special effects films.
  98 Mighty Joe Young.
  You see  Eddie Valiant falling and then  Mickey joins him but then they cut  before a certain other character  joins him.
 They don't have the rights to.
 Right.
  Joins him.
  So you know  bunch of which  Jason you're like dating  it and saying it's still around in 2019.
  Who in 2019 is watching this like  really.
 Are they so they use special  effects in movies.
  This is very educational.
  Uh huh.
  We've talked about Universal eventually  has like kind of gotten rid of a lot of that aspect  of everything.
 So  2019 I'm trying to was there anything.
 When did  Backdraft close? Don't know.
  Not too long ago.
  It closed for Transformers.
  Is that right? Yeah.
 I think it was before  I started doing this.
 Which was 2015.
  I'm just wondering what the last  like version of this I guess Animal Actors  are still like behind the scenes.
  Kind of.
 But by and large.
 They have  special effects state.
 They have like one  uh coordinated off.
 Yeah.
  One quarantined.
 Making of the movies.
  That's like that's the last thing left  in this genre of ride.
  Yeah.
 Yeah they're mostly gone.
 Are you fun  of any of this Scarlett? Like do any of these  is there a behind the scenes attraction  that strikes you like oh yeah that one's good.
  I mean I think the studio tour is very  good and I'm not just saying that because of the company  that I'm in.
 Yeah.
 But I think  you know it every time I'm on it I'm like  this is not my thing.
 Yeah.
 I like it.
  I still like that.
 Yeah.
 And there's enough of though  I mean those the big things that happen  in King Kong.
 Yeah.
 And the little  it's half and half with  fun stuff and then a little bit of  the subway scene great.
 Yeah.
  I know it's gonna happen every time  but I'm always delighted.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
  Absolutely.
 But you know  this? No.
  What happens is just so.
 Nothing.
  Nothing happens.
 Nothing happens.
  Before you get into the room where  nothing happens the  the this montage  ends and it ends with the death star  blowing up and then  and then it cuts to  just and then the smoke dissolves the fire  dissolves and Michael Clarke Duncan  you're greeted by Michael Clarke Duncan who says like  woo oh boy  ordinarily a massive  explosion like that could really hurt a guy.
  You mean the death  star? Yeah I'd say so.
  I heard a guy.
  Yeah.
 He's right.
 I don't think he knew  what was there.
 We're gonna put in an explosion.
  Okay.
 Not like the  biggest explosion that ever happened.
  The moon sized star base  blowing up.
 We would.
 Yeah.
 Oh boy.
  That was close.
 So  anyway Michael Clarke Duncan and this is  the biggest thing about how long this thing  ran.
 This attraction  ran for seven years  after the death of Michael  Clarke Duncan.
 Right.
 There's the only way  you and I saw it was well past  his demise.
  That's crazy.
 They just  take it out.
 It doesn't add  really anything.
 I mean  I guess then you're removing his  memory.
 Yeah.
 But it's  just weird though.
  There's no acknowledgement  of it.
 I feel like you're right  but like with any other this is  probably the least paid attention to  in the Disney company.
  You know what I mean? Like no one was even  paying attention before  when he was alive.
 No one was paying attention after.
  So like if it was a higher  profile thing people might have gone oh you know  we'll do something in there maybe as a little  if we'll leave it as a remembrance.
  There would be some thought is what I'm  saying versus I don't even know  if anybody remembered he was on there because  this is probably the most forgotten  attraction in any  park.
 Yes.
  Quite literally.
 Probably.
 I mean it's gotta  be in the top three I would think.
 Yeah.
  I mean I forgot it until you  tweeted about it.
  Maybe it shouldn't have been you know.
 You  condemned yourself to reliving it here.
  I mean it's like  it really is kind of like unpacking a trauma.
  Yeah.
  We'll talk about our  I think both of our spouses said some  it was like alright things are a little tense  after this thing happens.
 Jason  what are you? Well I was just there was one  moment watching someone's  camcorder footage of this  and I just thought it was so odd in this room.
  There's just a moment where like  first off it's showing it starts to  show footage of Armageddon and you're  like you're gonna be on the space station.
  The asteroid is coming for the space  station.
 That footage  again the aspect ratio was kind of  driving me a little nuts.
 I know in  a montage it's gonna jump around.
  But later when they're talking about the attraction  you are about to go on it was like  a letterboxed like a letterboxed  scenes from Armageddon  and then it cut to full screen  and it's just a very close  up shot of the colonel  and then  That's Stormare possibly? Yes.
  He's been out in space just a little bit  too long is the English translation  of what they're saying in this moment.
  And it just seemed like such an odd composition  of like alright we got a big  shot of this guy's face and then we're  translating what's going on.
  And then again stepping back and look at  the bigger picture I'm like okay so the characters  we've established we have the actor  Michael Clarke Duncan, the ship's  computer of course and then colonel  Andropov.
 We all remember  colonel Andropov.
  Colonel Andropov.
  All your favorites are there.
  So  Michael Clarke Duncan says a bunch  of stuff.
  He says  you're gonna come face to face with a rock  with a really bad attitude.
  And then he says can I get a little fresh air please  and then he gets hit with a fan  and then talks over a fan.
  I should see that one coming.
 Here on  special effects stages you have to be ready for  anything.
 So it's a kooky  the set's coming to life.
  I am happy seeing this guy  having fun and getting to be himself  especially post  his day.
 It reminds you  like this guy was good.
 He was great.
  Don't you put that  evil on me Ricky Bobby?  Oh that's right.
 And he's in Talladega Nights.
  Oh yeah that's good.
 And he has a scene where  he stabs him.
 Brill Ferrell stabs himself.
  Yeah that's a great scene.
 That's him.
  So you at least get  to see him have some fun.
  Then they say they're ready for you on the set and then  he's  at the end of it the note  that they leave it on.
 Cause these kinds of attractions  it's always like a little taste of what  you might experience in there.
  And in this case he's like well  don't worry you're gonna be fine.
 There's nothing to worry about.
  Right fellas? And then he joins  two gargoyles.
  And then he kind of laughs viciously.
  And then it irises in on his face.
  What do you mean? Am I gonna  see gargoyles? Are there gargoyles  in the next room? I mean that  would have been a plus off.
  I can confirm it is  Peter Stormare playing Colonel  Lev Andropov.
  So  we leave disappointing room number one  and go through a sad hallway  into disappointing room number two.
  You almost know already at this point you're like  this is the death mark.
 Also  let's track our  respective spouses.
 Yes, yes, yes.
  Cause mine, Erin, has  started.
 I could see her like  lose.
 It's already been a day.
  You started here.
 This was the first  attraction.
 The first thing we did in studios.
  I think we did.
 I went to look up photos  and it's like it's so long ago they're not even in my  Google photos.
 But we started  Disneyland which I believe my  husband thought was quite lackluster.
  And then from there we went to  studios and went to this.
  It makes me feel better too.
 I feel like sometimes I feel like  have I been hard on Paris in my crazy  in this litmus test.
 It's weird  cause like there's a lot about Disneyland  Paris that I'll happily make fun of.
  But then again like in  this current era it's really  kind of becoming its own thing.
  I had the most wonderful time there.
 Geez  that's nice.
 In 2021 not  on the trip that I did this.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  That was all it was still  in the doldrums a little bit.
 Yeah, Erin's  losing it a little bit.
 Erin's it's this I just remember  that this walk between the rooms just like  how quickly can this be  over.
 I don't think she, neither of us really know what's  coming but I'm like it might be good or at least it might be  funny.
 Then you get into a room  I mean like you all watch  the ride through this or the ride through  whatever.
 Stand through  stand up.
 You're  in a very tight  I mean this is this would be a COVID nightmare.
 It's  great that it closed before.
 It's  just like Star Cruiser.
 Oh yeah, yeah.
  Oh right.
  Yeah, Mastodon there now I  hear.
 Yep.
 Oh from  the jump.
 Oh already  it wasn't icy.
 Disney should have done  an immersive Armageddon  hotel.
 Do not give them that idea.
  We've done it for like 10 minutes and it  was horrible.
  Yeah, we don't need to spend more  but what if you could meet Rockhound?  Well, probably not Rockhound like a guy  that knows Rockhound.
  Well Rockhound I think is I haven't  watched this film but apparently the character  Rockhound says some very cancelable  things.
 Oh really? I think Rockhound  is a scumbag.
 If I recall he's  very horny.
  That's his kind of gimmick.
 So he's like  Pat O'Brien?  Maybe less.
  He might be more horny.
  Okay, well  we'll analyze this  later.
 One of my first exposures  to see  Buscemi  in this kind of  you know flat movie  otherwise.
 They stacked it up.
  It's good actors.
 It's got great actors.
  It does have a good cast.
  I'm not getting to do a lot of good  stuff.
 So  it's Russian Space Station.
  Even though you're walking into it  and it's an immersive environment when you walk in  the screens are not they don't show  space yet.
 They all are placeholder and they  say like Earth  feed meteor feed.
  So that's taking you out of it right away.
  You're on a set and that's not like  it's  just such a bummer immediately.
  And then they're calling out like  lighting changes.
 Let's  start shooting.
 So there's too much of that  set.
 Right.
 Overlay.
  Fake theme park.
 We're shooting a movie  nonsense.
 Yes.
 We're shooting  a movie that came out decades ago.
  Yeah.
 The opening of Hollywood Studios  style or I guess Universal  Studios like of just like yeah this  doesn't make any sense.
 I don't know why.
  Yeah.
 Unless it's that  superstar television where they're  like shooting new things with people on  that's what we call it.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 That makes sense.
  We're going to shoot scenes from famous things  with actual people.
 Yeah.
 That's like  the only context where it doesn't  people shouldn't be confused or like  what.
 It's so insane because  like if all right we want to take you  behind the scenes and show you how things are made.
  This is not how things are made.
  Sets aren't immersive and  360 degrees and they don't all happen  in the course of five minutes and  with like with the real  effects coming close to hurting  you.
 So like you know  it's already your it's already  fantastical what you're showing.
  You know what else is fantastical is  theme park.
 Rise of the Resistance is  fantastic.
 Why not just commit all  if Rise of the Resistance constantly had we're ready for  you on the first order set  to destroy  the entire thing.
 If  I can add something that also kind of  took me out of it because I watched two ride throughs  of this and by the first  the first minute of the second ride  through it was like God why did I find  another video.
  But I was interested in that  the one there was a cast member and their  outfit was like a gray  jumpsuit with like a yellow reflector  vest.
 But the first video I watched  it was just someone in like  theater blacks like a black  sweatshirt and black pants.
  But two different shades of black  like they truly looked like they were a standup  comic about to complain about  how you can't say anything anymore.
  Like that kind of black.
 And that  just threw me because I'm like I find  it hard if you're going to wear all black to  sometimes find the right matching shades  but I'm like wait Disney bought this  outfit why didn't they buy an outfit  with the same top and bottom.
  Unless they didn't.
  Because she didn't have a reflective  vest on.
 So I was like wait did you  just walk in?  Did you just walk in? It's like oh we got to  start running this thing I'm just going to hop up.
  They don't check uniforms anymore.
  Was it a turtleneck?  It was just like a crew neck.
  It wasn't like a  you know.
 Because I picture like  a French person.
 Oh no it wasn't that kind of turtleneck.
  A beatnik.
  I'm picturing a French beatnik from the 1960s.
  I mean that would really jazz it up.
  Anything.
  It's so funny to me because like there's so many  attractions that are like here's how movies are made.
  But I truly don't know how an Avengers  movie is made.
 I like I know there's a lot of blue  or green maybe.
 And then they  like stand on a box and somehow it looks  like they're flying above New York City.
 I don't get it.
  I would love to know.
 I would love to know.
  You're right.
 New things.
 I don't know how things are made  anymore.
 Like now if they updated  any of this it would be interesting.
 Like teach me how  you put all those people together in a scene.
  Are they all there or not? Are they in Atlanta?  What's going on?  You would be like you would be I think is you would  drive into like a room with  like 400 people at computers  being like these are the people who make the movie.
  You see it in the credits.
  These many people like animating  the Black Widow's like wrist gauntlet  firing mechanism or something.
  And then like they're just like tired  and upset and  not being paid enough.
 And those are the  people that make the movie.
 Filmmakers use a term  called crunch.
  He's working 16 to 18 hour days.
  Certain effects.
  There's more effects houses that like do  the big stuff and then there's like they farm out  certain effects to like different  sometimes in Marvel movies you can see like certain  CGI scenes are like look really good and then some  scenes look like absolute garbage.
  It's probably because like they were late and they were like I just farm  this out to a smaller company.
  Yeah really get it done.
 Whatever.
 We don't care.
  Just put a filter on the front  of it and make it look like it's dark out doesn't matter.
  Yeah.
 I mean the one of the last  big effect stories the last 10 years  was that the company  that did the effects  and then won a bunch of Oscars for a life of  pie had gone bankrupt  in between releasing the movie  and winning the Oscars for  a life of pie.
  Not an industry you're dying to.
 You know what they  genuinely could do.
 We talked about this before.
  They could do like  that the Mandalorian  practical the screens that look  really good if they did something with those.
  Oh yeah that'd be great.
 Because I would like to see  those in person and then it's like your kid  is in a scene that  shot instantaneously and you watch  and it looks like Mandalorian.
 That would  not be the worst.
 They should be  adding things of this nature.
 That's  something you could do in an environment like this  that would work and be cool.
 Yeah it's like we always  say more screens.
  We love screens.
 Of course we love  screens.
  But a forward looking like a forward looking  thing that kind of tricked like I was  tricked for the first few episodes.
 Like I didn't  realize they were doing that until they had like a featurette  on it.
  So yeah put and then sell the tape of you  in the  Mandalorian with Fennec Shand and  that's the name of the character.
  I mean they literally have empty  sound stages.
 There is no excuse.
  Yeah sure.
  Yeah it's better than literally nothing.
  Yes.
  This is one of those where like we could  say some things bit by bit  that happen in this  final part.
 But like what happened? Really?  Like can you even name  like let's name a moment of this  space station scene.
  I think it's like something hits something  and then  there's like does it jiggle then or does  it jiggle later? There's a jiggle.
  But I don't recall where.
  And then there's way more  pyro than I remembered.
  Yeah there's a lot of flames  in the room and here's another  thing I'm going to say that I don't particularly care  for is flames in  the room.
 I will  allow it in a set  like I acknowledge that it's cool  in the mummy coaster  in Florida.
 That's cool  enough that effect on the ceiling that I will  deal with that it's a little freaky.
  But like I don't know if this is like a  scary cat thing.
 It's like  haunts or launches.
 I think I'm okay  I just I don't want flames in the room  with me.
 It's never it's not cool  enough for me to not because  I think some of it is you start smelling that  gas a little even before it happens  and you think like oh flames coming  and I just don't it's I'm unnerved by the  like gas isn't a  fun thing to smell in a thing on  my vacation.
 Well it's so  close it is like mall  fountain level like  proximity.
 Like you get really  close to this little giant fireball  at the end.
 Yeah, yeah.
  I don't know how do we feel about flames? Am I  I guess I'm pro flame in a close  space I think.
 Yeah.
  Yeah you're pro.
  Okay Jason you're anti?  Well I want I want a little  distance.
 So what is a ride  comfortably? I think backdraft  that I'm comfortable with.
 This  like put putting  your little hands  under your head.
 Your little hands?  Next to like on the railing  and leaning over the railing  with your like head in your hands and a fireball  and six feet in front of you.
 That's  too much.
 You're like a teen girl on the bed  like this.
  This is like the sensual part of this  attraction.
 Thinking about  yeah.
 That's interesting.
  I don't know.
 I shoot a flame  at me.
 I don't like I'll make  wince I might get scared but at least I'm feeling  some I'm least I'm alive.
  Outside I was fine with it.
 Like some of my  family I feel like we went on  the Jaws ride once at Universal  and they were like these flames out there way  too hot way too close to the boat.
 I'm like  bring it on.
 We gotta we gotta get  that shark.
 Outside  your pro flame.
 Yeah yeah.
  Indiana Jones stunt show love those  flames.
 I've sat close at wrestling events  and they shoot a lot of pyro which is  loud as hell.
 See that would scare me.
 That's a temporary  setup.
 That's not a safe.
  This is a permanent flame.
 They're  blasting them out all day.
 I'm not concerned.
  Yeah well I guess  that's true.
 It's probably at this point  they've run it so many times and like  for Monday Night Raw that's  new that's fresh.
 They're on the road right?  In the morning yeah.
 That's like a carnival.
  That can't be trusted.
 Last year  I think the WrestleMania sign caught on fire  I think.
 This is what I'm talking about.
  I'm pretty sure.
 Michael I just want to  correct you.
 Multiple WrestleMania  signs.
  Oh god.
 Yeah.
  So.
 And that's the billion  dollar earning promotion.
  Sure yeah.
 Catching stuff on fire.
  I like that logic.
 This is interesting.
  So there's a whole spectrum here.
 There's no flame.
  There's outdoor flame.
 Not indoor  flame.
 There's total pro flame.
  And then there's pro  not temporary.
 Permaflame.
  Permaflame.
 Yes.
 Permaflame.
  Should we do the flame final four?  The theme park flame final  four? The best flame  scene.
 That's actually not a bad idea  maybe.
 I figured it out.
  But yeah exactly.
 It's all a mush.
  As it's happened.
 And it's all around  you which is interesting.
 But you also don't know where  to look.
 I think in not a good way.
  Were you close to this?  Because it's circular.
 It's like you're on  a donut.
 Because the center is where they have  the fire stuff.
 So were you closer  to the center or were you more towards the back?  I think maybe closer to the back.
  Maybe something unpleasant happened behind me  and I didn't know where to look at.
 Maybe I  just felt some heats.
 Were you putting  your head in your little hands? Yeah.
  When I was happening.
  I hope this is the best show I've ever seen.
  Bonjour asteroid.
  Where were you?  I was towards the back and I remember  being like oh I wish I would have known what this  was because I would have wanted to be right by the  flame.
 Oh okay.
  The center piece.
 The only thing to look at.
  Yeah because it does culminate  in then lights are out and the  plot wise what is this?  The space station if we haven't said  is getting attacked.
 But multiple  Yeah a bunch of asteroids are tearing through  the space station.
  There's two really big things  that rubbed me the wrong way about this ride.
  One it is based on a cut away  shot from the movie Armageddon.
  Interesting in the realm of podcasting.
  I think very interesting.
  And two  wait this ride is about you  just accepting inevitable  death.
 Like impending death  is coming to you.
 Which is a very  I mean that's very French film.
  But it's a little weird that it's in a Disney park  where it's just like oh you're all  going to die.
 But only in a  scene.
 But in one scene.
  But also Michael Clarke Duncan just told  you nothing bad is going to happen to you.
  And he's dead so.
  That's something bad happened to him.
  Yeah.
 Yeah it's a  boy it is already in a  grim park on a grim property  in the grimest part of it.
  Well maybe if you view it as  that as a reflection on death.
  Maybe that's a good angle on it.
  If you're not trying to view it as an exciting  e-ticket.
 I mean I guess I'm getting ahead of myself to  what we would have done to plus it up.
 But even if they had  had Bruce Willis's Harry  Stamper character like in the movie when  Liv Tyler is like at the  screen before he dies because he sacrifices  himself to save the earth.
  Even something like that would have maybe put a bow  on it that were like I don't know  that were like well  I guess that's not exactly that we're  burning Bruce Willis I guess in this case.
  So maybe I'm wrong.
 Maybe my  thought process is bad here.
  I maybe your only  thought process that's bad is the idea that this could be  a good thing.
  Were you satisfied then by  the because that's what I was getting at was  it's being destroyed by  so then what you feel at the end is like  that's the  final curtain kind of like  and now the flames that kill you  are bursting through the center  of your donut.
 Oh I legitimately had  no idea what was going on from start to  finish when I went on this.
  We should be Bruce Willis.
 Here's the  right thing.
 Liv should be on  a screen mourning us.
  Like all my good friends  are all my siblings or something.
  She remembers  the happy ending.
 I like that.
  I like that.
 So you see her.
  We have to have pushed  Affleck in because remember  the movie he was going to stay behind.
  Right.
 And and then Bruce Willis  like take care of my daughter.
  Yeah right.
  So it should be something like that  that we've we all collectively  throw Ben Affleck out a  hatch of some kind  and then the flame and Liv  mourns us then the flame comes through blows  us all up and then we're all heroes.
  We have lived  a hero experience.
 So we're  dead.
 We are dead.
 We're dead.
 Like Mr.
  Toe.
 There are attractions where you  die.
 Right.
 So make this  another one of those.
 Make it another one of those.
  And the one ride through I  watched the big fire  like at the end I was  like ooh that must have been really big  because the screen just went white.
  They were focused on that center  jet and I was just like  oh my god everything went white.
 Now it's going to be back  into focus.
 I was like well at least there's a big  ending I guess.
  With me not liking flames I  just didn't like that happening at all.
  Were you as a permaflame  fan did you at least like the ending  after all the struggle of the  experience? I don't know if I  have any recall of the  ending because I was trying to not  be actively divorced at that  moment.
 Cause I just  was standing next to my husband going  I forced him to come here.
 I  forced him to come to this park and he said  doesn't everyone say Disneyland Paris sucks?  And I said no  and let's go to both of them.
  So I was really just trying  to get out of the grave I had dug myself.
  So yeah what happens  right after?  This all is happening you're not  in the narrative of it.
 You are thinking how do  I need to save this day?  We realized at some  point in the donut room in the secondary  the worst room I would say perhaps.
  They're both bad.
 Unpleasant.
 It's also  very loud.
 It's just like here's a room with loud  sounds.
 That's the bulk of what this is.
  I mean we started  to realize this was the ride.
  This wasn't the pre-show  for the attraction that we thought we were going  to.
 This was the attraction.
  And that realization was  there's no amount of indoor fire  that could make that  better.
 So are you  apologetic?  Defensive? It's not my fault?  I mean I still can't really  live it down.
 It's  like Disneyland Paris will forever have a stink on it  because of this.
  We have very similar experiences  here because this was  at the very end of  my honeymoon by the way.
  This is the big mistake  we made is that like incredible  trip to Paris and  Rome and Florence and then we thought  well we end it back in Paris  so it can be a round trip.
  And we love Disney so it culminates in Disney  but it puts so much pressure  on it.
 I've said all this before.
 Florence  is probably the best place I've ever been.
 Maybe until  Tokyo but they're neck and neck.
  So we were coming from this euphoric experience  in this beautiful city with the best food  ever and now we're in the Armageddon  special show.
  And this was really  we even like we managed to have  some loopy fun in the  in our first day which was in the  Magic Kingdom Park.
 But still  it was like a struggle.
 We had to like really press  through and like it's like  we're so insane that it's fun.
 It's not  the relaxation that Honeymoon  could and should be.
 So now we're here  we even were at the gate going do we pay  for this dumb place? And it's  like well I don't know right behind  this gate is a new Disney theme  park that will probably never be near again.
  Maybe we need to do this.
  Maybe it'll be content someday  for something.
  And we go in and it would buy Armageddon we were thinking  maybe this was a bad it.
 Maybe we could have just like  I don't know gone into the city again.
  Just waved at the Eiffel Tower.
 Almost anything  else.
 Actually Erin in reliving it  said I would say  it's waiting for the dentist  is more pleasant than this.
  Maybe not the dentist itself if you're getting drilled.
  It's at least in English.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Or at least translated well.
  You can understand what's happening to you.
 There can be a  calm in a waiting room.
 I think we were  just talking about Jason you proposed that flying  can be like okay.
 You felt like a flight  can be fine.
 I yeah  like if you want to disconnect  like and just read a book or like  work on writing and stuff.
 I just  listened to this episode and I fully agree with you.
  Thank you.
 Yeah.
 Or train travel  very much the same.
 I was trains I feel like  they give away the Wi-Fi on Amtrak.
  But it's also  it's very bad.
  Wi-Fi is free.
  It's still like very expensive  for 30 minutes a Wi-Fi.
 I'm like American  Airlines.
 Like it's just not worth it.
  Why is that still so? That doesn't make any sense.
  But this is where I was thinking about this.
  I would rather sit on a plane almost.
 Even a plane  with mild turbulence than go on this Armageddon thing.
  It would be the same amount of turbulence  as that ride.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Which still is  not that.
 Yeah.
 I've been there's been  more exciting turbulence on a real plane  because there's it's a real disaster.
  Well that's a big drop.
  That's something.
 So  anyways we get out of it.
 Just this  was the kind of the pit of the day I felt  like.
 And Aaron's  just staring daggers.
 And once we once we  slowly file out of the room I think she turns to me  and says what about rides? Are there  rides in this park? Is there a ride anywhere  in this park? I think we had  not been on on a ride yet.
  And I said rock and roller  coasters that way.
 I'm not going to do it.
 I don't do  launches.
 You can go do it.
  And I went and watched this dumb Martin  Short show where he goes through the history  of movies.
 Oh my god.
 Like that's I can  handle the kitch.
 Aaron's like I need to  do a thing that someone might  enjoy without levels.
  And so we took some time  apart.
 We split up for a second.
  It literally made us split up.
 It split us up  on the last day of our honeymoon.
  It's important to have your own  interests.
 Yeah.
  She's interested in  not ruining her own life.
  Whereas I.
  So we took a little time and then we  reconvened.
 And I said oh how was that rock and  roller coaster? And she said it was fine.
  Do you want to get to the airport  early?  Pretty much how this went.
  Did you watch I forget what it's called there  but in Florida it's called Lights Motor Action.
  We didn't do that because by that point it was just  like what is the we need to bail on  this as quickly as let's go eat a crappy  burger in the Radisson  lobby.
 And then like  we cannot handle another like  sitting through a thing.
 I like I don't think  we haven't done Lights Motor Action.
  I am a Lights Motor Action defender.
  That was actually.
 I never saw it anywhere.
  Stunt driving and like cool  car tricks.
 That had some cool behind the  scenes stuff.
 Yeah.
  And then and then after a few years  Light McQueen drove in and  just did a lap and then left.
  Hey.
  I just feel so bad that you guys haven't  you know half of us haven't tested our  relationships inside this attraction.
  It's the ultimate test.
  You'll never know if it's true love.
  The ultimate stress test.
  But also they never will in a way  because this it's so funny we have this exact  say it's like tense in general  and then this is like  and you're on vacation because the possibilities  of what a vacation could be.
  You chose that and you're  you and I were responsible for  our spouse pain.
  I mean I'm still dealing  with it because we went back in November  and I had just gone with my mom  for multiple days so I had like really packed  in Disneyland Paris had a great time.
  I made my husband go back for one day.
 I was like  we're in Paris for a week.
 I have to do it.
  I'm there.
 I have to go.
 And I'm just now  remembering that I think he refused  to go on any ride.
 I don't think  we went on a single ride.
 He's like I will  walk in a circle around the park with you  and we brought our own sandwiches.
 He did not  eat.
 He did not ride.
 He was  just like this is my limit after  what happened.
 Well that seems like  a fair compromise.
  I'm sure conversely  he struck you to like work functions  or like dinner at the boss's  house or something.
 And you know  you gotta give and take.
  When you're using your Jason argument of it's work.
  I'm here for work.
 I'm doing work.
 I'm stressed  I'm at work.
 Yeah.
 So if  you put that on it.
 Yeah.
  I guess that's a way.
 Yeah.
 So just  remind.
 Listen.
 I don't think I hate anything  as much as he hates Disneyland Paris.
  Next time you're going to dinner at the boss's  house.
  So you know this is just the same  as the Armageddon ride.
 Exactly the same as having  to watch this Russian  cosmonaut translated  into multiple languages.
  The terrific Peter Storber.
  You get to see  45 seconds of it.
 You hear a voice that may  or may not be him.
 It could be a sound.
 It very  easily could be a sound like and there is  a computer voice.
 Cause he is  he is playing a Russian character  speaking English.
 But the computer  voice is doing kind of generic  computer voice but speaking French.
  So it's a real melting pot.
  You know.
 It's got that going.
  Yeah.
 And then you have to hear him say like  what is generator status.
  It is pretty  Boris Baranov.
  Sparkling dialogue.
 Great accent.
  This is fascinating.
  I'm actually now curious with what we have  experienced if any listeners  have run into this and where you  may be pushed a partner  to the brink.
 Who where I feel  like you know  if you're ending up in these parks even if the  person's not as big of a fan as  you and Aaron's a major Disney parks fan  but she's got the limit.
  And I'm curious of any stories of like where  did the limit set in.
  I'd be curious for any  or else everybody's just like it's never happened.
  Maybe find somebody who has no  limit.
 There was I'm trying to think but  I think I've said this on the show before.
 I think there was like  two Disney World trips ago.
 Lindsay was like  I think it was like day three or four.
  And she was like I gotta  sleep in.
 I'm tapping out  and I go well you can meet me  in Animal Kingdom.
 She's like fine.
  So I'm like  on the bus to Animal Kingdom  alone at like 9 a.
m.
  I didn't know this one.
  But also as Jason was saying  you have separate you know you have different  speeds of vacation.
 Yeah.
  Yes.
  When we were there in the fall I talked about  Jane tapped out on the Friday of  like a week long trip and she's like I'm  gonna the pool and I'm gonna take a bath.
  And I was just standing on concrete  in Hollywood Studios reading  like a blog that's like crowds  not seen since the July peak  on Veterans Day week.
 And I'm just like oh  my god.
  Having to like  defend yourself as the one who made the  right choice in situations like  that.
 No I mean not  mean then not going on  the roller coaster that goes fast.
  But I got to experience  Martin Short as a man with a  flip phone who gets  sucked into the history of  some of five movies that Disney  could afford.
 It was hard for me to say  I made the right choice in that situation.
  But there maybe there I think  at this time there was not a right choice  to be made at Disney Studios Paris.
  Oh after you do Armageddon everything's a write off.
  It's just over.
 Your day's  done.
 Let's just  round up to the end I guess.
 Yeah.
 Cause in  Orlando if you tap if you need to like  all right let's get the parks today  and stuff.
 Disney Springs has  so much to offer.
 The Disney  Village does not seem like it has that  appeal.
 Oh my God.
  Recently I'm he probably  doesn't mind if I say this friend of  the show Mac Cardona also has been to Disneyland  Paris recently and I think has sent me  some photos of the village.
  It seemed to me like he was  amped on it just that he was but maybe that  was I was not amped about Disney Village.
  I don't know that he had anything in depth to say.
  I mean it's got a pretty well preserved  planet Hollywood.
 He did send us  pictures from that.
 We were saying it's the only  trash planet Hollywood left.
 A good time capsule.
  Crazy looking one.
 Cause you know now that we're all  like there's these communal spaces  online for people who like the old stuff  to like reminisce about it and  that is one of the old places that still stands.
  Right yes.
 But it is definitely  not as fun as we  will think it was in ten years from now.
  This is true and you hate  to say it there's certain things where like look  if it's gonna be better to do something  new we all have the memories  increasingly we have like VR  walk throughs and exhaustive  videos.
 I can see the logic  in certain things changing  ever.
 Such as this.
  Such as even if there is one  strange person out there who like but Armageddon  was so crazy.
  I do think that the replacement  web slingers the new Spider  Man ride is going to  appeal to someone.
 I think  probably.
 More than this  trash.
 I am very nervous that  they're redoing the Boardwalk Hotel  in Orlando.
 They already got rid of  the clown slide it's all downhill.
  I guess that's true.
 That's my outlook.
  I mean we must protect  the nanny chairs.
 We are on nanny chair  watch 24 7 now.
  There are the nanny chairs.
  I don't see if anyone notices working  the graveyard shift.
  I am very concerned that they're going to  get rid of them.
 But I also  I was talking to someone a friend  of mine and he thinks that the coffee  bar that's being added is going where the  Bellevue Lounge is which was secretly  my favorite bar that I never told people about  because it used to not be busy and after the pandemic  or during the pandemic it became busy.
  But it was great.
 There's a wicker couch  that has cup holders built into the wicker.
  This is a library kind of  study.
 It's like that little the little annex bar  to the right of the Boardwalk lobby.
  What's it called again? Yeah they were yeah they're  Bellevue Inn I believe.
 I went  there last time I was down.
  Bellevue Lounge? Jane they're playing old timey radio.
  They're playing old timey radio.
  And she's like it's 10  AM we've been up for five hours.
  I don't care.
  This is supposed to red eye.
  This is when we were kind of land and kill time.
  We land and kill time when we're trapped by  the marathon.
 We could not get  anywhere.
 Oh that marathon story.
  We got trapped by the marathon.
 Never have we had more  sympathy for you.
 Our reservations  were to Epcot so we couldn't go  anywhere.
 You couldn't get into Epcot when it wasn't  open was the story.
 We couldn't  get into Epcot.
 We were baffled  by that story because it involved like and then there was a  cone there.
  Well there were so many cones and there was  runners and people were like no no you can't come  through.
 But it wasn't open.
  But  nothing was open.
  Besides like one breakfast  stand.
 Would it have  been on a non marathon day?  Well even the footpaths to like  Swan and Dolphin.
 But the footpaths  would have been open.
 Yeah  you could have gone a little more.
 So the issue  is that at 10am the footpaths weren't open.
  That's a big deal.
 You're trapped.
  We're trapped.
 You're trapped at the boardwalk.
 Your options  are very limited.
  The boardwalk was like half of everything  is closed.
 They half opened.
  And they half opened like the walkways  around the lake  resorts.
 And so  like we're able to walk to the boardwalk.
  But then the bus services  were only running to the open  parks that due to park reservation  systems we couldn't go anywhere.
  Are you getting more of a sense of why this was  Jason's Armageddon?  And I thought oh okay  we can go to Disney Springs.
  No.
 Disney Springs didn't open  until 10am.
 And this was earlier.
  So like.
 I'm trying.
  I will admit I got distracted  because on the disboards.
com  somebody wrote what is the Bellevue  room at boardwalk.
 And then somebody  just wrote under it the boardwalk bakery no  longer toasts bagel.
 Just sold  as is.
  No.
  It's worse than a Russian space station blowing up.
  I think that's what it's called though.
 Like the lobby bar essentially.
  Bellevue lounge is what it's called.
 Yeah.
  But I just got distracted by the  this course.
 That's sort of like if I was at a media  event I'd tell the people that I'm friends  with that we're meeting up at Bellevue.
  And then we'd all go there after.
  If you let the cat out of the bag is now  Bellevue gonna get swamped? Well I think it's gonna become this  coffee shop.
 Cause they just announced a whole redo.
  Oh.
 So Bellevue is  already the dream's over.
 Also I tried to go there  maybe during the 50th at some point and there was a line  to order cocktails.
 And I was like  no no no no no.
  I feel like when the other day  when I walked by the Hurston lounge at the Grand  California.
 It's a similar thing.
 There's like a little  coffee set up outside of it now.
  The bar was roped off early.
  There was a bunch of partitions and I'm like  oh okay this is kinda  no mans land.
 You gotta find your secret spots.
  Yeah.
 They're disappearing.
  Is the air bar still good?  I mean I've kind of avoided most tight  indoor places just cause the times I've visited  have been during like peak pandemic  times.
 But I haven't  been there in a while.
 I don't I feel  too old for a drink with cotton candy in it.
  Do they have that?  This is an insane statement you've just made in front of Mike Carson.
  Again you've made me upset but  no no  I didn't even know there was cotton candy.
  Yeah they have don't they have one that's cotton candy and then they pour  the drink in and then it dissolves and they're like  magic.
 That's interesting cause  I've only ever gotten like a good like  Manhattan in there.
 Oh well then maybe  that's the move.
 I had like two trips  ago I had like three Manhattans  in there once.
 And then I hit my  then walking to Frozen I hit my hand  hard on like a metal like kind of  railing somewhere and it was sore for days.
  Oh and that's where the  woman was trying to hit on my friend Luke  and I.
 Did you tell this you must have told  this one.
 I probably told this story I think.
  There was like a couple  we think but then we're like maybe they weren't a couple  and this woman was like  like coming on to me and my friend  Luke who were there.
 I was there although  I was there with my friends who were  married and Lindsay was not there.
  That was this trip.
 Cause I had  a third wheel trip.
 I was a third wheel  already.
 Yeah I had an annual pass.
  I bought an because at the time it made  sense to get the if I was going once to Disney  World it was still a time when it  made sense to get the  premier pass.
 Oh yeah you're speaking my language.
  Yeah.
 For Disneyland and Disney World.
  Yeah to get both parks cause it was literally  like you may as well just get it cause then you get  more access to Disneyland.
  Every day of the year.
 Every day of the year.
  Any park.
 It was amazing.
 Amazing  time to be alive and I was like well  now it's just like if I can get a quick trip in  and my friends were flexible so I  went with them and Lindsay had work so I  was there alone drinking three  Manhattans with them in the Abra Kedabra  and then a woman was like you're both so handsome  like it was like it was not  like one of the things we were like inferring  what's going on.
 It was like a very strong  sort of.
 We saw you from across the bar  and liked your vibe.
 It was just up  into that.
 That was not what happened.
  We had to bail quickly because  it was very strange.
  Wait you have had a stress test  not a marriage stress test at that  time but  on Disney property.
 That's  true yeah you're right.
 Do I throw it all away  for one night with the two  babes and what if  my friend Luke.
 One woman in it on two  men.
 Oh I thought there was a second.
  No no she was with a male friend like male  husband maybe like we got  a vibe it was like her husband but then maybe  it was obvious like or they have  an understanding.
 So that night  the swing was not isolated  at Jelly Rolls.
  It was at a few establishments  at the boardwalk.
 I think you mean  the Fins.
 Fins is where  it all goes down.
 What's that?  Fins.
 Which is where's Fins? The bar  at Walt Disney World's Swan.
  Swan's the bigger one.
  Cause that's the Convention Center hotel so everyone's  there.
 Everyone's there on business.
  Everyone's going out on the corporate dime.
  Things are happening at Fins.
  Interesting.
 That's where you swing at Disney.
  That is if you want to cheat on your spouse at Disney World  I always say go to Fins.
  Go to Fins.
  Garley's tips.
 Fins a lock.
  It's just so many hands trying to flag down  the bartender and then they all had the sunburn  and they all had the tan of the ring  but no rings on their fingers.
  It's a different  meaning of Fins up at that Fins.
  Wow that's the content we have  not explored on this podcast.
  Swinging tits.
 You stay there enough  and you know to like walk around the lobby  after midnight.
 Interesting.
  We know what the deal is at the Holiday  Inn Burbank.
  I think we talked about that  not long ago.
 We spent like a long time  at your birthday talking about  the Holiday Inn.
  Things I never knew I  what do you mean it's gone? It's a different brand now.
  Hotel Burbank.
  It seems real beige-y, hippie.
  We'll see.
 We haven't been over there.
  Will the swinging possibilities be as strong  as we're praying that they are?  It seems like that top floor  bar that we liked so much I think they  realized like oh wow we have amazing  we could charge a lot of money for people to come  up here.
 I haven't read  done it yet.
 It's still  crappy carpet.
  In Disneyland Paris is the place to have an affair  every quick service restaurant?  Any corner.
 Anywhere in the park.
  I don't know.
  I mean maybe one of those weird motels they have.
  Like the little like Toy Story  themed rooms I think.
 On rides.
  On small worlds.
 Anywhere  any surface.
 Do anything you want.
  Anywhere you want.
 City of Love.
  We were going for a while.
 I have one  little treat at the end here.
  I got curious if there was any  promotional material for the opening  of the Armageddon attraction  or for the Disney Studios  park in general.
  And I could not find any  in English or in French.
  But I did find an hour long  opening special in a language  that after watching for a little bit I  determined to be Dutch.
  This was made for Dutch  television.
 And it very  much in, boy you think you've done  like, you think you've seen it all in terms of crazy  Disney specials.
 And then you find  the 2002 Disney Studios opening.
  This thing is so nuts.
  It is the through line of it  is it is a group of children  who are all going  to experience different  they're experiencing all the wonderful  new attractions coming to Disney Paris.
  There's five kids and five attractions.
  Perfect.
 Don't need more than that.
  That's all we got.
  So it's very like, you know, the skits that  Regis would do but in all of the different  rides.
 So we end up with  this is how they represent Armageddon.
  There is a scene  that is it's basically a madcap  ride through the armadillo  through the drilling machine that you  brought up earlier.
 That was  sitting out in front of the ride.
 That is not  a ride or something that you could do at  the park.
 So they depict  like you'll go on a madcap armadillo  chase.
 But in  fact this does not happen.
 Another thing that  couldn't happen is the person who appears in this.
  There are there's celebrities throughout  the special but none none more  special than who you  meet in inside the armadillo.
  Talking about Knight Rider, right?  Kit.
 Yeah.
 So  Well, I won't reveal the other celebrities shows up a little bit later.
  But like  so basically, you know, like they bump  around.
 He's a  the kid Yoshi is driving  with kind of weird  Dutch glasses, very euro kid glasses.
  It's a big crazy  ride but they ultimately land.
 David  hits the emergency stop.
  And then this little scene occurs.
  Yoshi is  handed a big Lego  looking blue key.
 Right.
  Fit it in.
  Whoa.
  Then the key glows with  then the key is turned CGI and glows  and is magic.
 And then it cuts to who's coming up  next.
 Britney Spears.
 Original  Britney Spears appearance in this  stupid special.
 You know that shitty  Main Street, the indoor Main Street  in Disney Studios, Perry, that we haven't talked about.
  I kind of like it.
  Oh, really? OK.
 I just threw out she I don't  like that.
 I think it's a weird like  room.
 A little bit closer  to the room.
 Is that why you don't know?  No, different.
 It's not always flames.
  He doesn't like being transported to Hollywood  without leaving.
 I like seeing  the big sign shutter bugs  and gunga din.
  But she Britney performs  in front of shutter bugs and gunga.
 This is  Britney appearance.
 That's great.
 There is a  Destiny's Child performance.
  Really? Oh my God.
 And  Andrea Bocelli.
 I think these are  syndicated maybe to other specials.
  These aren't only for Dutch television.
 Right.
  But Britney hands one  of the kids a magic key.
 She does  stuff for this Dutch special.
  But there is but then it builds  to one final cameo at the  end.
 So you're out in front of the park  and there is  some like big glowy mechanism  and the kids have all assembled.
 They all have a magic  key.
 And then  here's the culmination of the  special.
 What have all the keys been  for? Let's  find out.
  Cuba Gooding Jr.
 for the people  listening.
 Cuba Gooding Jr.
 is  a hundred feet tall  and a ghost.
  He is God.
  I mean.
 He is the  almighty.
 Yeah.
 Because it's heavenly  life.
 I made you cars so that I could  see a world where everyone suffered.
  I don't know why.
 It's also  hi.
 My name  is Cuba Gooding Jr.
 Well if they don't  know who you are, if you're American, then  the name is not going to impress these  children.
 Kids with big Jerry Maguire fans?  I guess.
 It doesn't feel like they've met  because they don't say wow.
 They just kind of like  listen attentively.
 They're meeting a strange  like if we showed up in  the Netherlands and said  my name is Mike Carlson  doesn't mean anything to unless they're  a pipe.
 Unless there's a pipe.
 They might be a pipe.
  They're a right listener.
 Could be.
 Do they like  screen junkies? You may  know me from screen junkies  or for being God.
  Then it cuts to this  weird other angle behind Cuba.
 So they did  have coverage on this and the kids  are staring the wrong way.
 They were  not told to look up in the sky.
  So anyway, he resolves  this plot here.
 Each of you  is a truly outstanding individual  and I'm glad to hear you still have those keys  you found today.
 Because we  have one more surprise for you.
 Oh my God, he's so big.
  Yeah, he's like Zordon in Power Rangers.
  Now hold it tightly to your keys.
  Now take it out of the way.
  What? Those golden keys are now yours.
  They are keys to the studios  for each and every one of you to keep.
  For the rest of your  lives.
  Congratulations.
  What?  What?  Can you clarify something for me?  You don't have to reward it with  lifetime access after you bravely  stuck your thumbs in a leaky  dam.
  I, uh, yeah,  this is quite a scene, isn't it?  Cubicating Jr.
 is God.
 He  takes keys that were already  magic and glowing.
  Makes them not magic anymore.
  He turns them into literal keys.
 Well, they all turn gold.
  And now they're  actual keys that they have to  keep.
 But they get them into the, I guess  essentially they have free admission to this  bad theme park.
 Maybe.
  Or they just have a key to it.
 But they're actors.
  Yeah.
 So there's not,  it's not like they want to contest, right?  Unless, is that maybe the premise? Maybe they're presented  as real kids.
 And again, I don't speak  Dutch, so I don't know some of the ins and outs.
  Well, there's like, there's those stories that appear like  oh, so and so won like a lifetime  pass to Disneyland or something.
 Yeah.
  Which like still works and  unless JPEG's taking it away.
  I gotta make a reservation.
  That was maybe the first thing you did? They have to start  at DCA.
  Get a reservation.
 Look, we gotta  have rules.
 Uh, but I wonder  yeah, are they presenting that as if the kids  can get in forever? Maybe? I don't know.
  If you're one of those five Dutch children and you're  grown, uh, let us know  do the keys work? Was Britney  Spears exciting to meet? Was Hasselhoff  exciting to be in an armadillo with?  Hasselhoff in the armadillo  is really,  that feels like you made that video, Scott.
  Yeah, yeah, that's the most of my, like  these bad little, uh, you know, I  think they should have put the kit car from  Knight Rider in.
 Him having to drop.
  I love, he's such a cheeseball  that his acting  is just speaking clearly.
  Same thing.
 The act, acting  is the person who enunciates the most.
  Isn't that right? Wouldn't you agree? Um,  yeah, this is, boy, the special.
  Boy, oh boy.
 Wow, good find.
  Yeah, check out that special.
 Keep a gooding Jr.
's  god and, uh, I don't know,  as he should be.
 Yeah, yeah, well earned  and, Hasselhoff, sorry to interrupt,  Hasselhoff though, I'm trying to think, was it, uh,  he's been in one other pre-show video, is it for  that, um, um, Europe park? That weird boat ride  and yeah, yeah, I think so.
 Yeah, I believe  so.
 It was like, it was the night,  it was the kit boats.
 You're about  to board a kit boat.
 Yeah, but they don't have  the rights, that's the park with no rights, and I can't  think of the name of it already, but they had no movie  rights.
 There's like knockoff Doc Brown  in the parade.
 You're about to get on  the Prince of Boats.
 And it was like they had a tower  of terror.
 Yes.
  As well.
 Called that, but it's not  just a drop tower.
 So their Armageddon  is called, like,  Ultimate Comet 2000.
  Right.
  Yes.
  They have to shuffle it every six months to  make sure no one noticed.
 Yeah,  yeah, yeah.
 Keep changing the name of it.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, just keep because something might  be called that at this point.
 Yeah.
  That was the one with the, sorry to keep,  that was the Flashdance show?  I believe so.
  Movieland Italy?  We talked about this bizarre, there's an entire park  that is like this Armageddon,  if you want, as far as I could tell.
  This seems like the aesthetics of the Armageddon  attraction, but a full  where, yeah, they  basically, they start using IP in  the park, like,  and this is in Italy, Movieland Italy.
  They'll do like Batman and the Joker and  Mary Poppins until the IP rights  someone notices from it.
  Pull it, pull it, get it out.
  Yeah.
  The bride from Kill Bill  was walking around the lot  with the orange jumpsuit.
  Licensed by Quentin, I'm sure.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Well, anyways,  I also, now I'm wondering if like  Cuba took this as,  if a hundred foot tall god Cuba  took this as the, like,  I don't know, maybe now I can like,  is there any other hundred foot god  creatures I could swing with?  Oh.
  Good question.
 Now, kids, do you  see any other giant swagger,  any other translucent giants walking  around here?  Thanks, you're very special.
  Appreciate it.
  Well, thank you for taking us on this journey  through this.
  Thank you for allowing me to relive and  immediately forget everything we've been  through.
 And it's gone.
 It's immediately gone  except for the marital trauma.
  It'll be fine.
  It's worked out so far.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Yes, yeah.
 We all,  our marriages have survived our trip to Armageddon  and you survived Podcast The Ride.
  Thanks so much for joining us again.
  Let's exit through a leg  gift shop.
 Is there anything you'd  like to plug? Yeah,  my podcast, very amusing.
  We're back every week.
  I haven't made a  itinerary or schedule, so we're  winging it.
 But so far so good.
  We got episodes.
 They're coming out.
  It's great.
 And then you can find me on social  and all the social medias at Carly  Weisel.
 Fantastic.
  And yeah, thanks so much for being  back again.
 Great to do it IRL.
  Of course.
 It's so nice to be  in person and still distanced.
  Oh, great.
  It's a comfortable, less claustrophobic than a  Russian spaceship.

 I'm a little hankering to do  Cars Road Trip.
  Cars Road Trip's been calling out to me.
  This, this, the Smilin,  the big Smilin tanker  is his old world lights on fire.
  A lot of messages about accepting  your demise.
  This park.
 The whole park.
  Yeah.
 You know what? It's, I applaud  this park for getting us comfortable  with the idea of death.
  Yeah.
 I found the  person, there's a theory, of course,  with the cars.
 Yeah, sure.
 Yeah.
  This is just their hypothesis or their  questioning the fact that cars still have all the things  that you would need for a human.
 They have handles,  they have windows.
 They lock.
  They, you hear in the first thing, you hear cars  go like boop boop.
 Yeah.
  So there's, so basically, we'll talk about  this when we do Cars Road Trip very soon, I guess,  is that this person's guess  is that humans evolved into cars.
  Whoa.
  Wow.
  What are the intermediate  steps? Those are some weird,  that evolution has some very awkward  periods.
 Yes, I agree.
  But yes, the humans are  the cars.
 Maybe not evolved.
 Maybe like  there was something, I don't know,  a curse was put on the earth or something.
 Like something  happened or Jay Leno.
 Aren't there  too few cars? Like there would have had  to have been a genocide?  Like there had to have been something.
 Because there's not  that many cars in cars.
 In the cars?  Hmm.
 That's a good question.
 What is the population  of the earth in cars?  And if it's all cars, it's not that many.
  Yeah, because you don't see a ton.
 Well, we  don't get a sense of the full world.
  There's not even traffic in those films, is there?  In the second one? It depends.
 Sometimes  on the way to the women's restroom  is what they pause.
 That's the traffic.
 Right.
  I can't think about it.
  Yeah.
 So.
 Didn't we  say, I had the theory in our Late Shift  episode on the second gate that Jay  Leno has sex with the cars?  Yeah.
 How Jay Limo,  his character, was produced.
  Is that the literal offspring of  He's the missing link.
 Jay Leno,  yes.
 The key to the cars universe  is that Jay Leno had sex  with one of his classic cars and miraculously  the car gave birth  to Jay's  baby.
 So he would be  alive.
 I got the miracle of life.
  Have you heard about this? And he has so many  cars and he's poly  with his cars.
  If we're mapping over the.
.
.
 I can't get locked down.
  I'm married to one woman.
 Why would I be married to one car?  He's monogamous with Mavis,  but poly with the cars.
 I got a thousand  hole passes.
 His hole passes  every car.
  One year for Christmas  she gave it to him.
 On one side it said hole pass  and on the other side it said every car.
  So Cars is a movie about Jay  Leno's kids.
  Everyone you're looking at is descended  from Jay Leno.
 Yes.
 Okay.
  I'm not super knowledgeable about Planet of the Apes,  but is Caesar the one who.
.
.
  Is Caesar the ape who  gains intelligence from Jay?  By his speaks.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
  No!  With that by saying no it opened up  the hole.
 Right, right.
  It was Jay saying, yes! I will  have sex with the car.
  Eventually his head will  open real big like  Beetlej and it just honk.
  Beep beep.
  When he's still alive in  300 years.
 Why is he?  Oh, because he's a car.
 Yeah.
  In the parking garage  slash ashes of flappers  at the Magic and Comedy Club.
  Well, that's what that whole  episode is going to be like.
  We're off to the races.
  Okay, thanks for  listening everybody.
